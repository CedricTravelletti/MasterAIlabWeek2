<playwright>William Shakespeare</playwright>

<poembody>
<stanza>
<line>As the diall hand tells o&#8217;er the same hours it had before,</line>
<line>Still beginning and ending / circular account still lending.</line>
<line>So most mighty Queen we pray / like the diall day by day</line>
<line>You may lead the seasons on / making new when old are gon.</line>
<line>That the babe which now is young / &amp; hathe yet no use of tongue</line>
<line>Many a Shrovetide here may bow / to that empress I do now</line>
<line>That these children of these lords / sitting at your council boards</line>
<line>May be grave and ag√®d seen / of her that was their fathers&#8217; Queen.</line>
<line>Once I wish this wish again, / heaven subscribe it with amen.</line>
</stanza>
