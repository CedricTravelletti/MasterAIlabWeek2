<SCENEPERSONAE>(King Edward, Derby, Prince Edward, Audley, Artois, lords, Lorrain, Mountague)</SCENEPERSONAE>

<stagedir>Enter King Edward, Derby, Prince Edward, Audley, and Artois.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>Robert of Artois, banished though thou be</line>
<line>From France, thy native Country, yet with us</line>
<line>Thou shalt retain as great a Seigniorie:</line>
<line>For we create thee Earl of Richmond here.</line>
<line>And now go forwards with our pedigree:</line>
<line>Who next succeeded Phillip le Bew?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ARTOIS.</speaker>
<line>Three sons of his, which all successfully</line>
<line>Did sit upon their father&#8217;s regal throne,</line>
<line>Yet died, and left no issue of their loins.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>But was my mother sister unto those?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ARTOIS.</speaker>
<line>She was, my lord; and only Isabel</line>
<line>Was all the daughters that this Phillip had,</line>
<line>Whom afterward your father took to wife;</line>
<line>And from the fragrant garden of her womb</line>
<line>Your gracious self, the flower of Europe&#8217;s hope,</line>
<line>Derived is inheritor to France.</line>
<line>But note the rancor of rebellious minds:</line>
<line>When thus the lineage of le Bew was out,</line>
<line>The French obscured your mother&#8217;s privilege,</line>
<line>And, though she were the next of blood, proclaimed</line>
<line>John, of the house of Valois, now their king:</line>
<line>The reason was, they say, the realm of France,</line>
<line>Replete with princes of great parentage,</line>
<line>Ought not admit a governor to rule,</line>
<line>Except he be descended of the male;</line>
<line>And that&#8217;s the special ground of their contempt,</line>
<line>Wherewith they study to exclude your grace:</line>
<line>But they shall find that forged ground of theirs</line>
<line>To be but dusty heaps of brittle sand.</line>
<line>Perhaps it will be thought a heinous thing,</line>
<line>That I, a Frenchman, should discover this;</line>
<line>But heaven I call to record of my vows:</line>
<line>It is not hate nor any private wrong,</line>
<line>But love unto my country and the right,</line>
<line>Provokes my tongue, thus lavish in report.</line>
<line>You are the lineal watchman of our peace,</line>
<line>And John of Valois indirectly climbs;</line>
<line>What then should subjects but embrace their King?</line>
<line>Ah, where in may our duty more be seen,</line>
<line>Than striving to rebate a tyrant&#8217;s pride</line>
<line>And place the true shepherd of our commonwealth?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>This counsel, Artois, like to fruitful showers,</line>
<line>Hath added growth unto my dignity;</line>
<line>And, by the fiery vigor of thy words,</line>
<line>Hot courage is engendered in my breast,</line>
<line>Which heretofore was raked in ignorance,</line>
<line>But now doth mount with golden wings of fame,</line>
<line>And will approve fair Isabel&#8217;s descent,</line>
<line>Able to yoke their stubborn necks with steel,</line>
<line>That spurn against my sovereignty in France.</line>

<stagedir>Sound a horn.</stagedir>
<line>A messenger?&#8212;Lord Audley, know from whence.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit Audley, and returns.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>AUDLEY.</speaker>
<line>The Duke of Lorrain, having crossed the seas,</line>
<line>Entreats he may have conference with your highness.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>Admit him, lords, that we may hear the news.</line>
<stagedir>Exeunt lords. King takes his State. Re-enter lords; with Lorrain, attended.</stagedir>
<line>Say, Duke of Lorrain, wherefore art thou come?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LORRAIN.</speaker>
<line>The most renowned prince, King John of France,</line>
<line>Doth greet thee, Edward, and by me commands,</line>
<line>That, for so much as by his liberal gift</line>
<line>The Guyen Dukedom is entailed to thee,</line>
<line>Thou do him lowly homage for the same.</line>
<line>And, for that purpose, here I summon thee,</line>
<line>Repair to France within these forty days,</line>
<line>That there, according as the custom is,</line>
<line>Thou mayst be sworn true liegeman to our King;</line>
<line>Or else thy title in that province dies,</line>
<line>And he himself will repossess the place.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>See, how occasion laughs me in the face!</line>
<line>No sooner minded to prepare for France,</line>
<line>But straight I am invited,&#8212;nay, with threats,</line>
<line>Upon a penalty, enjoined to come:</line>
<line>&#8217;Twere but a childish part to say him nay.&#8212;</line>
<line>Lorrain, return this answer to thy lord:</line>
<line>I mean to visit him as he requests;</line>
<line>But how? Not servilely disposed to bend,</line>
<line>But like a conqueror to make him bow.</line>
<line>His lame unpolished shifts are come to light;</line>
<line>And truth hath pulled the vizard from his face,</line>
<line>That set a gloss upon his arrogance.</line>
<line>Dare he command a fealty in me?</line>
<line>Tell him, the Crown that he usurps, is mine,</line>
<line>And where he sets his foot, he ought to kneel.</line>
<line>&#8217;Tis not a petty dukedom that I claim,</line>
<line>But all the whole dominions of the realm;</line>
<line>Which if with grudging he refuse to yield,</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll take away those borrowed plumes of his,</line>
<line>And send him naked to the wilderness.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LORRAIN.</speaker>
<line>Then, Edward, here, in spite of all thy lords,</line>
<line>I do pronounce defiance to thy face.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRINCE EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>Defiance, Frenchman? We rebound it back,</line>
<line>Even to the bottom of thy master&#8217;s throat.</line>
<line>And, be it spoke with reverence of the king,</line>
<line>My gracious father, and these other lords,</line>
<line>I hold thy message but as scurrilous,</line>
<line>And him that sent thee, like the lazy drone,</line>
<line>Crept up by stealth unto the eagle&#8217;s nest;</line>
<line>From whence we&#8217;ll shake him with so rough a storm,</line>
<line>As others shall be warned by his harm.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WARWICK.</speaker>
<line>Bid him leave of the lion&#8217;s case he wears,</line>
<line>Least, meeting with the lion in the field,</line>
<line>He chance to tear him piecemeal for his pride.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ARTOIS.</speaker>
<line>The soundest counsel I can give his grace,</line>
<line>Is to surrender ere he be constrained.</line>
<line>A voluntary mischief hath less scorn,</line>
<line>Than when reproach with violence is borne.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LORRAIN.</speaker>
<line>Degenerate traitor, viper to the place</line>
<line>Where thou was fostered in thine infancy,</line>
<line>Bearest thou a part in this conspiracy?</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>He draws his sword.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>Lorrain, behold the sharpness of this steel:</line>
<stagedir>Drawing his.</stagedir>
<line>Fervent desire that sits against my heart,</line>
<line>Is far more thorny pricking than this blade;</line>
<line>That, with the nightingale, I shall be scared,</line>
<line>As oft as I dispose myself to rest,</line>
<line>Until my colours be displayed in France:</line>
<line>This is my final answer; so be gone.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LORRAIN.</speaker>
<line>It is not that, nor any English brave,</line>
<line>Afflicts me so, as doth his poisoned view,</line>
<line>That is most false, should most of all be true.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exeunt Lorrain, and Train.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>Now, lord, our fleeting bark is under sail;</line>
<line>Our gage is thrown, and war is soon begun,</line>
<line>But not so quickly brought unto an end.</line>
<stagedir>Enter Mountague.</stagedir>
<line>But wherefore comes Sir William Mountague?</line>
<line>How stands the league between the Scot and us?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MOUNTAGUE.</speaker>
<line>Cracked and dissevered, my renowned lord.</line>
<line>The treacherous King no sooner was informed</line>
<line>Of your with drawing of your army back,</line>
<line>But straight, forgetting of his former oath,</line>
<line>He made invasion on the bordering Towns:</line>
<line>Barwick is won, Newcastle spoiled and lost,</line>
<line>And now the tyrant hath begirt with siege</line>
<line>The castle of Rocksborough, where enclos&#8217;d</line>
<line>The Countess Salisbury is like to perish. </line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>That is thy daughter, Warwick, is it not?</line>
<line>Whose husband hath in Britain served so long</line>
<line>About the planting of lord Mountford there?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WARWICK.</speaker>
<line>It is, my lord.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>Ignoble David, hast thou none to grieve</line>
<line>But silly Ladies with thy threatening arms?</line>
<line>But I will make you shrink your snaily horns!</line>
<line>First, therefore, Audley, this shall be thy charge,</line>
<line>Go levy footmen for our wars in France;</line>
<line>And, Ned, take muster of our men at arms:</line>
<line>In every shire elect a several band.</line>
<line>Let them be Soldiers of a lusty spirit,</line>
<line>Such as dread nothing but dishonor&#8217;s blot;</line>
<line>Be wary, therefore, since we do commence</line>
<line>A famous war, and with so mighty a nation.</line>
<line>Derby, be thou ambassador for us</line>
<line>Unto our father in law, the Earl of Henalt:</line>
<line>Make him acquainted with our enterprise,</line>
<line>And likewise will him, with our own allies</line>
<line>That are in Flanders, to solicit to</line>
<line>The Emperor of Almaigne in our name.</line>
<line>Myself, whilst you are jointly thus employed,</line>
<line>Will, with these forces that I have at hand,</line>
<line>March, and once more repulse the traitorous Scot.</line>
<line>But, Sirs, be resolute: we shall have wars</line>
<line>On every side; and, Ned, thou must begin</line>
<line>Now to forget thy study and thy books,</line>
<line>And ure thy shoulders to an armor&#8217;s weight.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRINCE EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>As cheerful sounding to my youthful spleen</line>
<line>This tumult is of war&#8217;s increasing broils,</line>
<line>As, at the coronation of a king,</line>
<line>The joyful clamours of the people are,</line>
<line>When &#8220;Ave, Caesar!&#8221; they pronounce aloud.</line>
<line>Within this school of honor I shall learn</line>
<line>Either to sacrifice my foes to death,</line>
<line>Or in a rightful quarrel spend my breath.</line>
<line>Then cheerfully forward, each a several way;</line>
<line>In great affairs &#8217;tis nought to use delay.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exeunt.</stagedir>

<SCENEPERSONAE>(Countess, David, Douglas, Lorrain, Scot, Messenger, King Edward, Warwick, Artois)</SCENEPERSONAE>

<stagedir>Enter the Countess.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>COUNTESS.</speaker>
<line>Alas, how much in vain my poor eyes gaze</line>
<line>For succour that my sovereign should send!</line>
<line>Ah, cousin Mountague, I fear thou wants</line>
<line>The lively spirit, sharply to solicit</line>
<line>With vehement suit the king in my behalf:</line>
<line>Thou dost not tell him, what a grief it is</line>
<line>To be the scornful captive of a Scot,</line>
<line>Either to be wooed with broad untuned oaths,</line>
<line>Or forced by rough insulting barbarism;</line>
<line>Thou doest not tell him, if he here prevail,</line>
<line>How much they will deride us in the north,</line>
<line>And, in their wild, uncivil, skipping gigs,</line>
<line>Bray forth their conquest and our overthrow</line>
<line>Even in the barren, bleak, and fruitless air.</line>
<stagedir>Enter David and Douglas, Lorrain.</stagedir>
<line>I must withdraw, the everlasting foe</line>
<line>Comes to the wall; I&#8217;ll closely step aside,</line>
<line>And list their babble, blunt and full of pride.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING DAVID.</speaker>
<line>My lord of Lorrain, to our brother of France</line>
<line>Commend us, as the man in Christendom</line>
<line>That we most reverence and entirely love.</line>
<line>Touching your embassage, return and say,</line>
<line>That we with England will not enter parley,</line>
<line>Nor never make fair weather, or take truce;</line>
<line>But burn their neighbor towns, and so persist</line>
<line>With eager roads beyond their city York.</line>
<line>And never shall our bonny riders rest,</line>
<line>Nor rusting canker have the time to eat</line>
<line>Their light borne snaffles nor their nimble spurs,</line>
<line>Nor lay aside their Jacks of Gymould mayle,</line>
<line>Nor hang their staves of grained Scottish ash</line>
<line>In peaceful wise upon their city walls,</line>
<line>Nor from their buttoned tawny leathern belts</line>
<line>Dismiss their biting whinyards, till your King</line>
<line>Cry out, &#8220;Enough! Spare England now for pity!&#8221;</line>
<line>Farewell, and tell him that you leave us here</line>
<line>Before this castle; say, you came from us,</line>
<line>Even when we had that yielded to our hands.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LORRAIN.</speaker>
<line>I take my leave, and fairly will return</line>
<line>Your acceptable greeting to my king.</line>
<stagedir>Exit Lorrain.</stagedir>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING DAVID.</speaker>
<line>Now, Douglas, to our former task again,</line>
<line>For the division of this certain spoil.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DOUGLAS.</speaker>
<line>My liege, I crave the lady, and no more.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING DAVID.</speaker>
<line>Nay, soft ye, sir; first I must make my choice,</line>
<line>And first I do bespeak her for myself.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DOUGLAS.</speaker>
<line>Why then, my liege, let me enjoy her jewels.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING DAVID.</speaker>
<line>Those are her own, still liable to her,</line>
<line>And who inherits her, hath those with all.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter a Scot in haste.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>MESSENGER.</speaker>
<line>My liege, as we were pricking on the hills,</line>
<line>To fetch in booty, marching hitherward,</line>
<line>We might descry a might host of men;</line>
<line>The sun, reflecting on the armour, shewed</line>
<line>A field of plate, a wood of picks advanced.</line>
<line>Bethink your highness speedily herein:</line>
<line>An easy march within four hours will bring</line>
<line>The hindmost rank unto this place, my liege.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING DAVID.</speaker>
<line>Dislodge, dislodge! It is the king of England.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DOUGLAS.</speaker>
<line>Jemmy, my man, saddle my bonny black.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING DAVID.</speaker>
<line>Meanst thou to fight, Douglas? We are too weak.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DOUGLAS.</speaker>
<line>I know it well, my liege, and therefore fly.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>COUNTESS.</speaker>
<stagedir>Coming forward.</stagedir>
<line>My lords of Scotland, will ye stay and drink?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING DAVID.</speaker>
<line>She mocks at us, Douglas; I cannot endure it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>COUNTESS.</speaker>
<line>Say, good my lord, which is he must have the Lady,</line>
<line>And which her jewels? I am sure, my lords,</line>
<line>Ye will not hence, till you have shared the spoils.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING DAVID.</speaker>
<line>She heard the messenger, and heard our talk;</line>
<line>And now that comfort makes her scorn at us.</line>
<stagedir>Another messenger.</stagedir>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MESSENGER.</speaker>
<line>Arm, my good lord! O, we are all surprised!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>COUNTESS.</speaker>
<line>After the French ambassador, my liege,</line>
<line>And tell him, that you dare not ride to York;</line>
<line>Excuse it that your bonny horse is lame.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING DAVID.</speaker>
<line>She heard that too; intolerable grief!</line>
<line>Woman, farewell! Although I do not stay...</line>
<stagedir>Exeunt Scots.</stagedir>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>COUNTESS.</speaker>
<line>&#8217;Tis not for fear, and yet you run away.&#8212;</line>
<line>O happy comfort, welcome to our house!</line>
<line>The confident and boisterous boasting Scot,</line>
<line>That swore before my walls they would not back</line>
<line>For all the armed power of this land,</line>
<line>With faceless fear that ever turns his back,</line>
<line>Turned hence against the blasting north-east wind</line>
<line>Upon the bare report and name of arms.</line>
<stagedir>Enter Mountague.</stagedir>
<line>O Summer&#8217;s day! See where my Cousin comes!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MOUNTAGUE.</speaker>
<line>How fares my Aunt? We are not Scots;</line>
<line>Why do you shut your gates against your friends?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>COUNTESS.</speaker>
<line>Well may I give a welcome, cousin, to thee,</line>
<line>For thou comst well to chase my foes from hence.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MOUNTAGUE.</speaker>
<line>The king himself is come in person hither;</line>
<line>Dear aunt, descend, and gratulate his highness.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>COUNTESS.</speaker>
<line>How may I entertain his majesty,</line>
<line>To shew my duty and his dignity?</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit, from above.</stagedir>

<stagedir>Enter King Edward, Warwick, Artois, with others.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>What, are the stealing Foxes fled and gone,</line>
<line>Before we could uncouple at their heels?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WARWICK.</speaker>
<line>They are, my liege; but, with a cheerful cry,</line>
<line>Hot hounds and hardy chase them at the heels.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Countess.</stagedir>
<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>This is the countess, Warwick, is it not?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WARWICK.</speaker>
<line>Even she, my liege; whose beauty tyrants fear,</line>
<line>As a May blossom with pernicious winds,</line>
<line>Hath sullied, withered, overcast, and done.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>Hath she been fairer, Warwick, than she is?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WARWICK.</speaker>
<line>My gracious King, fair is she not at all,</line>
<line>If that herself were by to stain herself,</line>
<line>As I have scene her when she was herself.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>What strange enchantment lurked in those her eyes,</line>
<line>When they excelled this excellence they have,</line>
<line>That now her dim decline hath power to draw</line>
<line>My subject eyes from persing majesty,</line>
<line>To gaze on her with doting admiration?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>COUNTESS.</speaker>
<line>In duty lower than the ground I kneel,</line>
<line>And for my dull knees bow my feeling heart,</line>
<line>To witness my obedience to your highness,</line>
<line>With many millions of a subject&#8217;s thanks</line>
<line>For this your royal presence, whose approach</line>
<line>Hath driven war and danger from my gate.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>Lady, stand up; I come to bring thee peace,</line>
<line>How ever thereby I have purchased war.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>COUNTESS.</speaker>
<line>No war to you, my liege; the Scots are gone,</line>
<line>And gallop home toward Scotland with their hate.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>Least, yielding here, I pine in shameful love,</line>
<line>Come, we&#8217;ll pursue the Scots;&#8212;Artois, away!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>COUNTESS.</speaker>
<line>A little while, my gracious sovereign, stay,</line>
<line>And let the power of a mighty king</line>
<line>Honor our roof; my husband in the wars,</line>
<line>When he shall hear it, will triumph for joy;</line>
<line>Then, dear my liege, now niggard not thy state:</line>
<line>Being at the wall, enter our homely gate.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>Pardon me, countess, I will come no near;</line>
<line>I dreamed tonight of treason, and I fear.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>COUNTESS.</speaker>
<line>Far from this place let ugly treason lie!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>No farther off, than her conspiring eye,</line>
<line>Which shoots infected poison in my heart,</line>
<line>Beyond repulse of wit or cure of art.</line>
<line>Now, in the sun alone it doth not lie,</line>
<line>With light to take light from a mortal eye;</line>
<line>For here two day stars that mine eyes would see</line>
<line>More than the sun steals mine own light from me,</line>
<line>Contemplative desire, desire to be</line>
<line>In contemplation, that may master thee!</line>
<line>Warwick, Artois, to horse and let&#8217;s away!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>COUNTESS.</speaker>
<line>What might I speak to make my sovereign stay?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>What needs a tongue to such a speaking eye,</line>
<line>That more persuades than winning Oratory?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>COUNTESS.</speaker>
<line>Let not thy presence, like the April sun,</line>
<line>Flatter our earth and suddenly be done.</line>
<line>More happy do not make our outward wall</line>
<line>Than thou wilt grace our inner house withal.</line>
<line>Our house, my liege, is like a country swain,</line>
<line>Whose habit rude and manners blunt and plain</line>
<line>Presageth nought, yet inly beautified</line>
<line>With bounties, riches and faire hidden pride.</line>
<line>For where the golden ore doth buried lie,</line>
<line>The ground, undecked with nature&#8217;s tapestry,</line>
<line>Seems barren, sere, unfertile, fructless, dry;</line>
<line>And where the upper turf of earth doth boast</line>
<line>His pied perfumes and party coloured coat,</line>
<line>Delve there, and find this issue and their pride</line>
<line>To spring from ordure and corruption&#8217;s side.</line>
<line>But, to make up my all too long compare,</line>
<line>These ragged walls no testimony are,</line>
<line>What is within; but, like a cloak, doth hide</line>
<line>From weather&#8217;s Waste the under garnished pride.</line>
<line>More gracious then my terms can let thee be,</line>
<line>Intreat thyself to stay a while with me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>As wise, as fair; what fond fit can be heard,</line>
<line>When wisdom keeps the gate as beauty&#8217;s guard?&#8212;</line>
<line>It shall attend, while I attend on thee:</line>
<line>Come on, my lords; here will I host tonight.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>LODOWICK.</speaker>
<line>I might perceive his eye in her eye lost,</line>
<line>His ear to drink her sweet tongue&#8217;s utterance,</line>
<line>And changing passion, like inconstant clouds</line>
<line>That rack upon the carriage of the winds,</line>

<line>Lo, when she blushed, even then did he look pale,</line>
<line>As if her cheeks by some enchanted power</line>

<line>Anon, with reverent fear when she grew pale,</line>
<line>His cheeks put on their scarlet ornaments;</line>

<line>Than brick to coral or live things to dead.</line>
<line>Why did he then thus counterfeit her looks?</line>
<line>If she did blush, twas tender modest shame,</line>
<line>Being in the sacred presence of a King;</line>
<line>If he did blush, twas red immodest shame,</line>
<line>To veil his eyes amiss, being a king;</line>
<line>If she looked pale, twas silly woman&#8217;s fear,</line>
<line>To bear herself in presence of a king;</line>
<line>If he looked pale, it was with guilty fear,</line>
<line>To dote amiss, being a mighty king.</line>
<line>Then, Scottish wars, farewell; I fear twill prove</line>
<line>A lingering English siege of peevish love.</line>
<line>Here comes his highness, walking all alone.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter King Edward.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>She is grown more fairer far since I came hither,</line>
<line>Her voice more silver every word than other,</line>
<line>Her wit more fluent. What a strange discourse</line>
<line>Unfolded she of David and his Scots!</line>
<line>&#8220;Even thus,&#8221; quoth she, &#8220;he spake,&#8221; and then spoke broad,</line>
<line>With epithites and accents of the Scot,</line>
<line>But somewhat better than the Scot could speak:</line>
<line>&#8220;And thus,&#8221; quoth she, and answered then herself&#8212;</line>
<line>For who could speak like her but she herself&#8212;</line>
<line>Breathes from the wall an angel&#8217;s note from heaven</line>
<line>Of sweet defiance to her barbarous foes.</line>
<line>When she would talk of peace, me thinks, her tongue</line>
<line>Commanded war to prison; when of war,</line>
<line>It wakened Caesar from his Roman grave,</line>
<line>To hear war beautified by her discourse.</line>
<line>Wisdom is foolishness but in her tongue,</line>
<line>Beauty a slander but in her fair face,</line>
<line>There is no summer but in her cheerful looks,</line>
<line>Nor frosty winter but in her disdain.</line>
<line>I cannot blame the Scots that did besiege her,</line>
<line>For she is all the treasure of our land;</line>
<line>But call them cowards, that they ran away,</line>
<line>Having so rich and fair a cause to stay.&#8212;</line>
<line>Art thou there, Lodowick? Give me ink and paper.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LODOWICK.</speaker>
<line>I will, my liege.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>And bid the lords hold on their play at chess,</line>
<line>For we will walk and meditate alone.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LODOWICK.</speaker>
<line>I will, my sovereign.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit Lodowick.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>This fellow is well read in poetry,</line>
<line>And hath a lusty and persuasive spirit;</line>
<line>I will acquaint him with my passion,</line>
<line>Which he shall shadow with a veil of lawn,</line>
<line>Through which the queen of beauties queen shall see</line>
<line>Her self the ground of my infirmity.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Lodowick.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>Hast thou pen, ink, and paper ready, Lodowick?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LODOWICK.</speaker>
<line>Ready, my liege.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>Then in the summer arbor sit by me,</line>
<line>Make it our counsel house or cabinet:</line>
<line>Since green our thoughts, green be the conventicle,</line>
<line>Where we will ease us by disburdening them.</line>
<line>Now, Lodowick, invocate some golden muse,</line>
<line>To bring thee hither an enchanted pen,</line>
<line>That may for sighs set down true sighs indeed,</line>
<line>Talking of grief, to make thee ready groan; </line>
<line>And when thou writest of tears, encouch the word</line>
<line>Before and after with such sweet laments,</line>
<line>That it may raise drops in a Tartar&#8217;s eye,</line>
<line>And make a flintheart Scythian pitiful;</line>
<line>For so much moving hath a Poet&#8217;s pen:</line>
<line>Then, if thou be a poet, move thou so,</line>
<line>And be enriched by thy sovereign&#8217;s love.</line>
<line>For, if the touch of sweet concordant strings</line>
<line>Could force attendance in the ears of hell,</line>
<line>How much more shall the strains of poets&#8217; wit</line>
<line>Beguile and ravish soft and humane minds?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LODOWICK.</speaker>
<line>To whom, my lord, shall I direct my stile?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>To one that shames the fair and sots the wise;</line>
<line>Whose bod is an abstract or a brief,</line>
<line>Contains each general virtue in the world.</line>
<line>Better than beautiful thou must begin,</line>
<line>Devise for fair a fairer word than fair,</line>
<line>And every ornament that thou wouldest praise,</line>
<line>Fly it a pitch above the soar of praise.</line>
<line>For flattery fear thou not to be convicted;</line>
<line>For, were thy admiration ten times more,</line>
<line>Ten times ten thousand more the worth exceeds</line>
<line>Of that thou art to praise, thy praises worth.</line>
<line>Begin; I will to contemplate the while:</line>
<line>Forget not to set down, how passionate,</line>
<line>How heart sick, and how full of languishment,</line>
<line>Her beauty makes me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LODOWICK.</speaker>
<line>Write I to a woman?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>What beauty else could triumph over me,</line>
<line>Or who but women do our love lays greet?</line>
<line>What, thinkest thou I did bid thee praise a horse?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LODOWICK.</speaker>
<line>Of what condition or estate she is,</line>
<line>&#8217;Twere requisite that I should know, my lord.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>Of such estate, that hers is as a throne,</line>
<line>And my estate the footstool where she treads:</line>
<line>Then mayst thou judge what her condition is</line>
<line>By the proportion of her mightiness.</line>
<line>Write on, while I peruse her in my thoughts.&#8212;</line>
<line>Her voice to music or the nightingale&#8212;</line>
<line>To music every summer leaping swain</line>
<line>Compares his sunburnt lover when she speaks;</line>
<line>And why should I speak of the nightingale?</line>
<line>The nightingale sings of adulterate wrong,</line>
<line>And that, compared, is too satyrical;</line>
<line>For sin, though sin, would not be so esteemed,</line>
<line>But, rather, virtue sin, sin virtue deemed.</line>
<line>Her hair, far softer than the silk worm&#8217;s twist,</line>
<line>Like to a flattering glass, doth make more fair</line>
<line>The yellow Amber:&#8212;like a flattering glass</line>
<line>Comes in too soon; for, writing of her eyes,</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll say that like a glass they catch the sun,</line>
<line>And thence the hot reflection doth rebound</line>
<line>Against the breast, and burns my heart within.</line>
<line>Ah, what a world of descant makes my soul</line>
<line>Upon this voluntary ground of love!&#8212;</line>
<line>Come, Lodowick, hast thou turned thy ink to gold?</line>
<line>If not, write but in letters capital</line>
<line>My mistress&#8217; name, and it will gild thy paper:</line>
<line>Read, lord, read;</line>
<line>Fill thou the empty hollows of mine ears</line>
<line>With the sweet hearing of thy poetry.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LODOWICK.</speaker>
<line>I have not to a period brought her praise.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>Her praise is as my love, both infinite,</line>
<line>Which apprehend such violent extremes,</line>
<line>That they disdain an ending period.</line>
<line>Her beauty hath no match but my affection;</line>
<line>Hers more than most, mine most and more than more:</line>
<line>Hers more to praise than tell the sea by drops,</line>
<line>Nay, more than drop the massy earth by sands,</line>
<line>And sand by sand print them in memory:</line>
<line>Then wherefore talkest thou of a period</line>
<line>To that which craves unended admiration?</line>
<line>Read, let us hear.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LODOWICK.</speaker>
<line><recite>&#8220;More fair and chaste than is the queen of shades,&#8221;&#8212;</recite></line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>That line hath two faults, gross and palpable:</line>
<line>Comparest thou her to the pale queen of night, </line>
<line>Who, being set in dark, seems therefore light?</line>
<line>What is she, when the sun lifts up his head,</line>
<line>But like a fading taper, dim and dead?</line>
<line>My love shall brave the eye of heaven at noon,</line>
<line>And, being unmasked, outshine the golden sun.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LODOWICK.</speaker>
<line>What is the other fault, my sovereign lord?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>Read o&#8217;er the line again.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LODOWICK.</speaker>
<line><recite>&#8220;More fair and chaste&#8221;&#8212;</recite></line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>I did not bid thee talk of chastity,</line>
<line>To ransack so the treasure of her mind;</line>
<line>For I had rather have her chased than chaste.</line>
<line>Out with the moon line, I will none of it;</line>
<line>And let me have her likened to the sun:</line>
<line>Say she hath thrice more splendour than the sun,</line>
<line>That her perfections emulate the sun,</line>
<line>That she breeds sweets as plenteous as the sun,</line>
<line>That she doth thaw cold winter like the sun,</line>
<line>That she doth cheer fresh summer like the sun,</line>
<line>The she doth dazzle gazers like the sun;</line>
<line>And, in this application to the sun,</line>
<line>Bid her be free and general as the sun,</line>
<line>Who smiles upon the basest weed that grows</line>
<line>As lovingly as on the fragrant rose.</line>
<line>Let&#8217;s see what follows that same moonlight line.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LODOWICK.</speaker>
<line>&#8220;More fair and chaste than is the queen of shades,</line>
<line>More bold in constance&#8221;&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line offset="5">In constance! Than who?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LODOWICK.</speaker>
<line>&#8220;Than Judith was.&#8221;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>O monstrous line! Put in the next a sword,</line>
<line>And I shall woo her to cut of my head.</line>
<line>Blot, blot, good Lodowick! Let us hear the next.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LODOWICK.</speaker>
<line>There&#8217;s all that yet is done.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>I thank thee then; thou hast done little ill,</line>
<line>But what is done, is passing, passing ill.</line>
<line>No, let the captain talk of boisterous war,</line>
<line>The prisoner of emured dark constraint,</line>
<line>The sick man best sets down the pangs of death,</line>
<line>The man that starves the sweetness of a feast,</line>
<line>The frozen soul the benefit of fire,</line>
<line>And every grief his happy opposite:</line>
<line>Love cannot sound well but in lover&#8217;s tongues;</line>
<line>Give me the pen and paper, I will write.</line>
<stagedir>Enter Countess.</stagedir>
<line>But soft, here comes the treasurer of my spirit.&#8212;</line>
<line>Lodowick, thou knowst not how to draw a battle;</line>
<line>These wings, these flankers, and these squadrons</line>
<line>Argue in thee defective discipline:</line>
<line>Thou shouldest have placed this here, this other here.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>COUNTESS.</speaker>
<line>Pardon my boldness, my thrice gracious lords;</line>
<line>Let my intrusion here be called my duty,</line>
<line>That comes to see my sovereign how he fares.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>Go, draw the same, I tell thee in what form.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LODOWICK.</speaker>
<line>I go.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit Lodowick.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>COUNTESS.</speaker>
<line>Sorry I am to see my liege so sad:</line>
<line>What may thy subject do to drive from thee</line>
<line>Thy gloomy consort, sullome melancholy?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>Ah, lady, I am blunt and cannot straw</line>
<line>The flowers of solace in a ground of shame:&#8212;</line>
<line>Since I came hither, Countess, I am wronged.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>COUNTESS.</speaker>
<line>Now God forbid that any in my house</line>
<line>Should think my sovereign wrong! Thrice gentle King,</line>
<line>Acquaint me with your cause of discontent.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>How near then shall I be to remedy?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>COUNTESS.</speaker>
<line>As near, my liege, as all my woman&#8217;s power</line>
<line>Can pawn itself to buy thy remedy.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>If thou speakst true, then have I my redress:</line>
<line>Engage thy power to redeem my Joys,</line>
<line>And I am joyful, Countess; else I die.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>COUNTESS.</speaker>
<line>I will, my Liege.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>Swear, Countess, that thou wilt.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>COUNTESS.</speaker>
<line>By heaven, I will.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>Then take thyself a little way a side,</line>
<line>And tell thyself, a king doth dote on thee;</line>
<line>Say that within thy power it doth lie</line>
<line>To make him happy, and that thou hast sworn</line>
<line>To give him all the joy within thy power:</line>
<line>Do this, and tell me when I shall be happy.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>COUNTESS.</speaker>
<line>All this is done, my thrice dread sovereign: </line>
<line>That power of love, that I have power to give,</line>
<line>Thou hast with all devout obedience;</line>
<line>Employ me how thou wilt in proof thereof.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>Thou hear&#8217;st me say that I do dote on thee.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>COUNTESS.</speaker>
<line>If on my beauty, take it if thou canst;</line>
<line>Though little, I do prize it ten times less;</line>
<line>If on my virtue, take it if thou canst,</line>
<line>For virtue&#8217;s store by giving doth augment;</line>
<line>Be it on what it will, that I can give</line>
<line>And thou canst take away, inherit it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>It is thy beauty that I would enjoy.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>COUNTESS.</speaker>
<line>O, were it painted, I would wipe it off</line>
<line>And dispossess myself, to give it thee.</line>
<line>But, sovereign, it is soldered to my life:</line>
<line>Take one and both; for, like an humble shadow,</line>
<line>It haunts the sunshine of my summer&#8217;s life.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>But thou mayst lend it me to sport with all.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>COUNTESS.</speaker>
<line>As easy may my intellectual soul</line>
<line>Be lent away, and yet my body live,</line>
<line>As lend my body, palace to my soul,</line>
<line>Away from her, and yet retain my soul.</line>
<line>My body is her bower, her court, her abbey,</line>
<line>And she an angel, pure, divine, unspotted:</line>
<line>If I should leave her house, my lord, to thee,</line>
<line>I kill my poor soul and my poor soul me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>Didst thou not swear to give me what I would?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>COUNTESS.</speaker>
<line>I did, my liege, so what you would I could.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>I wish no more of thee than thou mayst give:&#8212;</line>
<line>Nor beg I do not, but I rather buy&#8212;</line>
<line>That is, thy love; and for that love of thine</line>
<line>In rich exchange I tender to thee mine.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>COUNTESS.</speaker>
<line>But that your lips were sacred, my lord,</line>
<line>You would profane the holy name of love.</line>
<line>That love you offer me you cannot give,</line>
<line>For Caesar owes that tribute to his queen;</line>
<line>That love you beg of me I cannot give,</line>
<line>For Sara owes that duty to her lord.</line>
<line>He that doth clip or counterfeit your stamp</line>
<line>Shall die, my lord; and will your sacred self</line>
<line>Commit high treason against the King of Heaven,</line>
<line>To stamp his image in forbidden metal,</line>
<line>Forgetting your allegiance and your oath?</line>
<line>In violating marriage sacred law,</line>
<line>You break a greater honor than yourself:</line>
<line>To be a king is of a younger house</line>
<line>Than to be married; your progenitour,</line>
<line>Sole reigning Adam on the universe,</line>
<line>By God was honored for a married man,</line>
<line>But not by him anointed for a king.</line>
<line>It is a penalty to break your statutes,</line>
<line>Though not enacted with your highness&#8217; hand:</line>
<line>How much more, to infringe the holy act,</line>
<line>Made by the mouth of God, sealed with his hand?</line>
<line>I know, my sovereign, in my husband&#8217;s love,</line>
<line>Who now doth loyal service in his wars,</line>
<line>Doth but so try the wife of Salisbury,</line>
<line>Whither she will hear a wanton&#8217;s tale or no,</line>
<line>Lest being therein guilty by my stay,</line>
<line>From that, not from my liege, I turn away.</line>
<stagedir>Exit.</stagedir>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>Whether is her beauty by her words dying,</line>
<line>Or are her words sweet chaplains to her beauty?</line>
<line>Like as the wind doth beautify a sail,</line>
<line>And as a sail becomes the unseen wind,</line>
<line>So do her words her beauties, beauties words.</line>
<line>O, that I were a honey gathering bee,</line>
<line>To bear the comb of virtue from this flower,</line>
<line>And not a poison sucking envious spider,</line>
<line>To turn the juice I take to deadly venom!</line>
<line>Religion is austere and beauty gentle;</line>
<line>Too strict a guardian for so fair a ward!</line>
<line>O, that she were, as is the air, to me!</line>
<line>Why, so she is, for when I would embrace her,</line>
<line>This do I, and catch nothing but myself.</line>
<line>I must enjoy her; for I cannot beat</line>
<line>With reason and reproof fond love a way.</line>
<stagedir>Enter Warwick.</stagedir>
<line>Here comes her father: I will work with him,</line>
<line>To bear my colours in this field of love.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WARWICK.</speaker>
<line>How is it that my sovereign is so sad?</line>
<line>May I with pardon know your highness grief;</line>
<line>And that my old endeavor will remove it,</line>
<line>It shall not cumber long your majesty.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>A kind and voluntary gift thou proferest,</line>
<line>That I was forward to have begged of thee.</line>
<line>But, O thou world, great nurse of flattery,</line>
<line>Why dost thou tip men&#8217;s tongues with golden words,</line>
<line>And peise their deeds with weight of heavy lead,</line>
<line>That fair performance cannot follow promise?</line>
<line>O, that a man might hold the heart&#8217;s close book</line>
<line>And choke the lavish tongue, when it doth utter</line>
<line>The breath of falsehood not charactered there!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WARWICK.</speaker>
<line>Far be it from the honor of my age,</line>
<line>That I should owe bright gold and render lead;</line>
<line>Age is a cynic, not a flatterer.</line>
<line>I say again, that if I knew your grief,</line>
<line>And that by me it may be lessened,</line>
<line>My proper harm should buy your Highness&#8217; good.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>These are the vulgar tenders of false men,</line>
<line>That never pay the duty of their words.</line>
<line>Thou wilt not stick to swear what thou hast said;</line>
<line>But, when thou knowest my grief&#8217;s condition,</line>
<line>This rash disgorged vomit of thy word</line>
<line>Thou wilt eat up again, and leave me helpless.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WARWICK.</speaker>
<line>By heaven, I will not, though your majesty</line>
<line>Did bid me run upon your sword and die.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>Say that my grief is no way medicinable</line>
<line>But by the loss and bruising of thine honour.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WARWICK.</speaker>
<line>If nothing but that loss may vantage you,</line>
<line>I would accompt that loss my vantage too.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>Thinkst that thou canst unswear thy oath again?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WARWICK.</speaker>
<line>I cannot; nor I would not, if I could.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>But, if thou dost, what shall I say to thee?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WARWICK.</speaker>
<line>What may be said to any perjured villain,</line>
<line>That breaks the sacred warrant of an oath.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>What wilt thou say to one that breaks an oath?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WARWICK.</speaker>
<line>That he hath broke his faith with God and man,</line>
<line>And from them both stands excommunicate.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>What office were it, to suggest a man</line>
<line>To break a lawful and religious vow?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WARWICK.</speaker>
<line>An office for the devil, not for man.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>That devil&#8217;s office must thou do for me,</line>
<line>Or break thy oath, or cancel all the bonds</line>
<line>Of love and duty twixt thyself and me;</line>
<line>And therefore, Warwick, if thou art thyself,</line>
<line>The lord and master of thy word and oath,</line>
<line>Go to thy daughter; and in my behalf</line>
<line>Command her, woo her, win her any ways,</line>
<line>To be my mistress and my secret love.</line>
<line>I will not stand to hear thee make reply:</line>
<line>Thy oath break hers, or let thy sovereign die.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>WARWICK.</speaker>
<line>O doting King! O detestable office!</line>
<line>Well may I tempt myself to wrong myself,</line>
<line>When he hath sworn me by the name of God</line>
<line>To break a vow made by the name of God.</line>
<line>What, if I swear by this right hand of mine</line>
<line>To cut this right hand off? The better way</line>
<line>Were to profane the Idol than confound it:</line>
<line>But neither will I do; I&#8217;ll keep mine oath,</line>
<line>And to my daughter make a recantation</line>
<line>Of all the virtue I have preacht to her:</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll say, she must forget her husband Salisbury,</line>
<line>If she remember to embrace the king;</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll say, an oath may easily be broken,</line>
<line>But not so easily pardoned, being broken;</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll say, it is true charity to love,</line>
<line>But not true love to be so charitable;</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll say, his greatness may bear out the shame,</line>
<line>But not his kingdom can buy out the sin;</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll say, it is my duty to persuade,</line>
<line>But not her honesty to give consent.</line>
<stagedir>Enter Countess.</stagedir>
<line>See where she comes; was never father had</line>
<line>Against his child an embassage so bad?</line>

<stagedir>Aside.</stagedir>
<line>How shall I enter in this graceless arrant?</line>
<line>I must not call her child, for where&#8217;s the father</line>
<line>That will in such a suit seduce his child?</line>
<line>Then, &#8220;wife of Salisbury&#8221;; shall I so begin?</line>
<line>No, he&#8217;s my friend, and where is found the friend</line>
<line>That will do friendship such indammagement?</line>
<stagedir>To the Countess.</stagedir>
<line>Neither my daughter nor my dear friend&#8217;s wife,</line>
<line>I am not Warwick, as thou thinkst I am,</line>
<line>But an attorney from the court of hell,</line>
<line>That thus have housed my spirit in his form,</line>
<line>To do a message to thee from the king.</line>
<line>The mighty king of England dotes on thee:</line>
<line>He that hath power to take away thy life,</line>
<line>Hath power to take thy honor; then consent</line>
<line>To pawn thine honor rather than thy life:</line>
<line>Honor is often lost and got again,</line>
<line>But life, once gone, hath no recovery.</line>
<line>The sun, that withers hay, doth nourish grass;</line>
<line>The king, that would disdain thee, will advance thee.</line>
<line>The poets write that great Achilles&#8217; spear</line>
<line>Could heal the wound it made: the moral is,</line>
<line>What mighty men misdo, they can amend.</line>
<line>The lion doth become his bloody jaws,</line>
<line>And grace his forragement by being mild,</line>
<line>When vassel fear lies trembling at his feet.</line>
<line>The king will in his glory hide thy shame;</line>
<line>And those that gaze on him to find out thee,</line>
<line>Will lose their eyesight, looking in the sun.</line>
<line>What can one drop of poison harm the sea,</line>
<line>Whose huge vastures can digest the ill</line>
<line>And make it loose his operation?</line>
<line>The king&#8217;s great name will temper thy misdeeds,</line>
<line>And give the bitter potion of reproach,</line>
<line>A sugared, sweet and most delicious taste.</line>
<line>Besides, it is no harm to do the thing</line>
<line>Which without shame could not be left undone.</line>
<line>Thus have I in his majesty&#8217;s behalf</line>
<line>Appareled sin in virtuous sentences,</line>
<line>And dwell upon thy answer in his suit.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>COUNTESS.</speaker>
<line>Unnatural besiege! Woe me unhappy,</line>
<line>To have escaped the danger of my foes,</line>
<line>And to be ten times worse injured by friends!</line>
<line>Hath he no means to stain my honest blood,</line>
<line>But to corrupt the author of my blood</line>
<line>To be his scandalous and vile solicitor?</line>
<line>No marvel though the branches be then infected,</line>
<line>When poison hath encompassed the root:</line>
<line>No marvel though the leprous infant die,</line>
<line>When the stern dame invenometh the Dug.</line>
<line>Why then, give sin a passport to offend,</line>
<line>And youth the dangerous reign of liberty:</line>
<line>Blot out the strict forbidding of the law,</line>
<line>And cancel every cannon that prescribes</line>
<line>A shame for shame or penance for offence.</line>
<line>No, let me die, if his too boistrous will</line>
<line>Will have it so, before I will consent</line>
<line>To be an actor in his graceless lust.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WARWICK.</speaker>
<line>Why, now thou speakst as I would have thee speak:</line>
<line>And mark how I unsay my words again.</line>
<line>An honorable grave is more esteemed</line>
<line>Than the polluted closet of a king:</line>
<line>The greater man, the greater is the thing,</line>
<line>Be it good or bad, that he shall undertake:</line>
<line>An unreputed mote, flying in the sun,</line>
<line>Presents a greater substance than it is:</line>
<line>The freshest summer&#8217;s day doth soonest taint</line>
<line>The loathed carrion that it seems to kiss:</line>
<line>Deep are the blows made with a mighty axe:</line>
<line>That sin doth ten times aggravate itself,</line>
<line>That is committed in a holy place:</line>
<line>An evil deed, done by authority,</line>
<line>Is sin and subornation: deck an ape</line>
<line>In tissue, and the beauty of the robe</line>
<line>Adds but the greater scorn unto the beast.</line>
<line>A spatious field of reasons could I urge</line>
<line>Between his glory, daughter, and thy shame:</line>
<line>That poison shews worst in a golden cup;</line>
<line>Dark night seems darker by the lightning flash;</line>
<line>Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds;</line>
<line>And every glory that inclines to sin,</line>
<line>The shame is treble by the opposite.</line>
<line>So leave I with my blessing in thy bosom,</line>
<line>Which then convert to a most heavy curse,</line>
<line>When thou convertest from honor&#8217;s golden name</line>
<line>To the black faction of bed blotting shame.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>COUNTESS.</speaker>
<line>I&#8217;ll follow thee; and when my mind turns so,</line>
<line>My body sink my soul in endless woe!</line>

<line>Thrice noble Audley, well encount&#8217;red here!</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>AUDLEY.</speaker>
<line>&#8217;Tis full a fortnight, since I saw his highness</line>
<line>What time he sent me forth to muster men;</line>
<line>Which I accordingly have done, and bring them hither</line>
<line>In fair array before his majesty.</line>
<line>What news, my Lord of Derby, from the Emperor?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DERBY.</speaker>

<line>The king is in his closet, malcontent;</line>
<line>For what, I know not, but he gave in charge,</line>

<line>Thus from the heart&#8217;s aboundance speaks the tongue;</line>
<line>Countess for Emperor: and, indeed, why not?</line>

<stagedir>Drum within.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>What drum is this that thunders forth this march,</line>
<line>To start the tender Cupid in my bosom?</line>
<line>Poor sheepskin, how it brawls with him that beateth it!</line>
<line>Go, break the thundring parchment bottom out,</line>
<line>And I will teach it to conduct sweet lines</line>
<line>Unto the bosom of a heavenly nymph;</line>
<line>For I will use it as my writing paper,</line>
<line>And so reduce him from a scolding drum</line>
<line>To be the herald and dear counsel bearer</line>
<line>Betwixt a goddess and a mighty king.</line>
<line>Go, bid the drummer learn to touch the Lute,</line>
<line>Or hang him in the braces of his drum,</line>
<line>For now we think it an uncivil thing,</line>
<line>To trouble heaven with such harsh resounds:</line>
<line>Away!</line>
<stagedir>Exit.</stagedir>
<line>The quarrel that I have requires no arms</line>
<line>But these of mine: and these shall meet my foe</line>
<line>In a deep march of penetrable groans;</line>
<line>My eyes shall be my arrows, and my sighs</line>
<line>Shall serve me as the vantage of the wind,</line>
<line>To whirl away my sweetest artillery.</line>
<line>Ah, but, alas, she wins the sun of me,</line>
<line>For that is she herself, and thence it comes</line>
<line>That poets term the wanton warrior blind;</line>
<line>But love hath eyes as judgement to his steps,</line>
<line>Till too much loved glory dazzles them.&#8212;</line>
<stagedir>Enter Lodowick.</stagedir>

</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Prince Edward.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>I see the boy; oh, how his mother&#8217;s face,</line>
<line>Modeled in his, corrects my strayed desire,</line>
<line>And rates my heart, and chides my thievish eye,</line>
<line>Who, being rich enough in seeing her,</line>
<line>Yet seeks elsewhere: and basest theft is that</line>
<line>Which cannot cloak itself on poverty.&#8212;</line>
<line>Now, boy, what news?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRINCE EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>I have assembled, my dear lord and father,</line>
<line>The choicest buds of all our English blood</line>
<line>For our affairs in France; and here we come</line>
<line>To take direction from your majesty.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>Still do I see in him delineate</line>
<line>His mother&#8217;s visage; those his eyes are hers,</line>
<line>Who, looking wistely on me, make me blush:</line>
<line>For faults against themselves give evidence;</line>
<line>Lust is fire, and men like lanthornes show</line>
<line>Light lust within themselves, even through themselves.</line>
<line>Away, loose silks of wavering vanity!</line>
<line>Shall the large limit of fair Britain</line>
<line>By me be overthrown, and shall I not</line>
<line>Master this little mansion of myself?</line>
<line>Give me an armor of eternal steel!</line>
<line>I go to conquer kings; and shall I not then</line>
<line>Subdue myself? And be my enemy&#8217;s friend?</line>
<line>It must not be.&#8212;Come, boy, forward, advance!</line>
<line>Let&#8217;s with our colours sweet the air of France.</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>Why, there it goes! That very smile of hers</line>
<line>Hath ransomed captive France, and set the King,</line>
<line>The Dauphin, and the peers at liberty.&#8212;</line>
<line>Go, leave me, Ned, and revel with thy friends.</line>
<stagedir>Exit Prince Edward.</stagedir>
<line>Thy mother is but black, and thou, like her,</line>
<line>Dost put it in my mind how foul she is.&#8212;</line>
<line>Go, fetch the Countess hither in thy hand,</line>
<line>And let her chase away these winter clouds,</line>
<line>For she gives beauty both to heaven and earth.</line>
<stagedir>Exit Lodowick.</stagedir>
<line>The sin is more to hack and hew poor men,</line>
<line>Than to embrace in an unlawful bed</line>
<line>The register of all rarities</line>
<line>Since leatheren Adam till this youngest hour.</line>
<stagedir>Enter Countess escorted by Lodowick.</stagedir>
<line>Go, Lodowick, put thy hand into my purse,</line>
<line>Play, spend, give, riot, waste, do what thou wilt,</line>
<line>So thou wilt hence awhile and leave me here.</line>
<stagedir>Exit Lodowick.</stagedir>
<line>Now, my soul&#8217;s playfellow, art thou come</line>
<line>To speak the more than heavenly word of &#8220;yea&#8221;</line>
<line>To my objection in thy beauteous love?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>COUNTESS.</speaker>
<line>My father on his blessing hath commanded&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>That thou shalt yield to me?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>COUNTESS.</speaker>
<line>Aye, dear my liege, your due.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>And that, my dearest love, can be no less</line>
<line>Than right for right and tender love for love.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>COUNTESS.</speaker>
<line>Then wrong for wrong and endless hate for hate.&#8212;</line>
<line>But,&#8212;sith I see your majesty so bent,</line>
<line>That my unwillingness, my husband&#8217;s love,</line>
<line>Your high estate, nor no respect respected</line>
<line>Can be my help, but that your mightiness</line>
<line>Will overbear and awe these dear regards&#8212;</line>
<line>I bind my discontent to my content,</line>
<line>And what I would not I&#8217;ll compel I will,</line>
<line>Provided that yourself remove those lets</line>
<line>That stand between your highness&#8217; love and mine.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>Name them, fair Countess, and, by heaven, I will.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>COUNTESS.</speaker>
<line>It is their lives that stand between our love,</line>
<line>That I would have choked up, my sovereign.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>Whose lives, my Lady?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>COUNTESS.</speaker>
<line offset="5">My thrice loving liege,</line>
<line>Your Queen and Salisbury, my wedded husband,</line>
<line>Who living have that title in our love,</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>Thy opposition is beyond our Law.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>COUNTESS.</speaker>
<line>So is your desire: if the law</line>
<line>Can hinder you to execute the one,</line>
<line>Let it forbid you to attempt the other.</line>
<line>I cannot think you love me as you say,</line>
<line>Unless you do make good what you have sworn.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>No more; thy husband and the Queen shall die.</line>
<line>Fairer thou art by far than Hero was,</line>
<line>Beardless Leander not so strong as I:</line>
<line>He swom an easy current for his love,</line>
<line>But I will through a Hellespont of blood,</line>
<line>To arrive at Sestos where my Hero lies.</line>

<line>Nay, You&#8217;ll do more; You&#8217;ll make the river to</line>
<line>With their heart bloods that keep our love asunder,</line>
<line>Of which my husband and your wife are twain.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>Thy beauty makes them guilty of their death</line>
<line>And gives in evidence that they shall die;</line>
<line>Upon which verdict I, their Judge, condemn them.</line>

<speaker>COUNTESS.</speaker>
<stagedir>Aside.</stagedir>
<line>O perjured beauty, more corrupted judge!</line>
<line>When to the great star-chamber o&#8217;er our heads</line>

<line>Resolute to be dissolute; and, therefore, this:</line>
<line>Keep but thy word, great king, and I am thine.</line>
<line>Stand where thou dost, I&#8217;ll part a little from thee,</line>
<line>And see how I will yield me to thy hands.</line>
<stagedir>Turning suddenly upon him, and showing two daggers.</stagedir>
<line>Here by my side doth hang my wedding knifes:</line>
<line>Take thou the one, and with it kill thy Queen,</line>
<line>And learn by me to find her where she lies;</line>
<line>And with this other I&#8217;ll dispatch my love,</line>
<line>Which now lies fast a sleep within my heart:</line>
<line>When they are gone, then I&#8217;ll consent to love.</line>
<line>Stir not, lascivious king, to hinder me;</line>
<line>My resolution is more nimbler far,</line>
<line>Than thy prevention can be in my rescue,</line>
<line>And if thou stir, I strike; therefore, stand still,</line>
<line>And hear the choice that I will put thee to:</line>
<line>Either swear to leave thy most unholy suit</line>
<line>And never hence forth to solicit me;</line>
<line>Or else, by heaven, this sharp-pointed knife</line>
<line>Shall stain thy earth with that which thou would stain,</line>
<line>My poor chaste blood. Swear, Edward, swear,</line>
<line>Or I will strike and die before thee here.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>Even by that power I swear, that gives me now</line>
<line>The power to be ashamed of myself,</line>
<line>I never mean to part my lips again</line>
<line>In any words that tends to such a suit.</line>
<line>Arise, true English lady, whom our isle</line>

<line>Of her, whose ransacked treasury hath taskt</line>
<line>The vain endeavor of so many pens:</line>
<line>Arise, and be my fault thy honor&#8217;s fame,</line>

<speech>
<speaker>MARINER.</speaker>
<line>Near to the coast I have descried, my lord,</line>
<line>As I was buy in my watchful charge,</line>
<line>The proud armado of King Edward&#8217;s ships:</line>
<line>Which, at the first, far off when I did ken,</line>
<line>Seemed as it were a grove of withered pines;</line>
<line>But, drawing near, their glorious bright aspect,</line>
<line>Their streaming ensigns, wrought of coloured silk,</line>
<line>Like to a meadow full of sundry flowers,</line>
<line>Adorns the naked bosom of the earth:</line>
<line>Majestical the order of their course,</line>
<line>Figuring the horned circle of the moon:</line>
<line>And on the top gallant of the admiral</line>
<line>And likewise all the handmaids of his train</line>
<line>The arms of England and of France unite</line>
<line>Are quartered equally by heralds&#8217; art:</line>
<line>Thus, tightly carried with a merry gale,</line>
<line>They plough the ocean hitherward amain.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>KING JOHN.</speaker>
<line>Dare he already crop the Fleur de Luce?</line>
<line>I hope, the honey being gathered thence,</line>
<line>He, with the spider, afterward approached,</line>
<line>Shall suck forth deadly venom from the leaves.&#8212;</line>
<line>But where&#8217;s our navy? How are they prepared</line>
<line>To wing themselves against this flight of ravens?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MARINER.</speaker>
<line>They, having knowledge, brought them by the scouts,</line>
<line>Did break from Anchor straight, and, puffed with rage,</line>
<line>No otherwise then were their sails with wind,</line>
<line>Made forth, as when the empty eagle flies,</line>
<line>To satisfy his hungry griping maw.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING JOHN.</speaker>
<line>There&#8217;s for thy news. Return unto thy bark;</line>
<line>And if thou scape the bloody stroke of war</line>
<line>And do survive the conflict, come again,</line>
<line>And let us hear the manner of the fight.</line>
<stagedir>Exit Mariner.</stagedir>
<line>Mean space, my lords, &#8217;tis best we be dispersed</line>
<line>To several places, least they chance to land:</line>
<line>First you, my lord, with your Bohemian troops,</line>
<line>Shall pitch your battailes on the lower hand;</line>
<line>My eldest son, the Duke of Normandy,</line>
<line>Together with the aide of Muscovites,</line>
<line>Shall climb the higher ground another way;</line>
<line>Here in the middle cost, betwixt you both,</line>
<line>Phillip, my youngest boy, and I will lodge.</line>
<line>So, lords, be gone, and look unto your charge:</line>
<line>You stand for France, an empire fair and large.</line>
<stagedir>Exeunt.</stagedir>
<line>Now tell me, Phillip, what is thy concept,</line>
<line>Touching the challenge that the English make?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PHILLIP.</speaker>
<line>I say, my lord, claim Edward what he can,</line>
<line>And bring he ne&#8217;er so plain a pedigree,</line>
<line>&#8217;Tis you are in the possession of the crown,</line>
<line>And that&#8217;s the surest point of all the law:</line>
<line>But, were it not, yet ere he should prevail,</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll make a conduit of my dearest blood,</line>
<line>Or chase those straggling upstarts home again.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING JOHN.</speaker>
<line>Well said, young Phillip! Call for bread and wine,</line>
<line>That we may cheer our stomachs with repast,</line>
<line>To look our foes more sternly in the face.</line>
<stagedir>A table and provisions brought in. The battle hard a far off.</stagedir>
<line>Now is begun the heavy day at sea:</line>
<line>Fight, Frenchmen, fight! Be like the field of bears,</line>
<line>When they defend their younglings in the caves!</line>
<line>Stir, angry nemesis, the happy helm,</line>
<line>That, with the sulphur battles of your rage,</line>
<line>The English fleet may be dispersed and sunk.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Shot.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>PHILLIP.</speaker>
<line>O Father, how this echoing cannon shot,</line>
<line>Like sweet harmony, digests my eats!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING JOHN.</speaker>
<line>Now, boy, thou hearest what thundering terror &#8217;tis</line>
<line>To buckle for a kingdom&#8217;s sovereignty:</line>
<line>The earth, with giddy trembling when it shakes,</line>
<line>Or when the exhalations of the air</line>
<line>Breaks in extremity of lightning flash,</line>
<line>Affrights not more than kings, when they dispose</line>
<line>To shew the rancor of their high swollen hearts.</line>
<stagedir>Retreat.</stagedir>
<line>Retreat is sounded; one side hath the worse;</line>
<line>O, if it be the French, sweet fortune, turn;</line>
<line>And, in thy turning, change the forward winds,</line>
<line>That, with advantage of a favoring sky,</line>
<line>Our men may vanquish, and the other fly!</line>
<stagedir>Enter Mariner.</stagedir>
<line>My heart misgives:&#8212;say, mirror of pale death,</line>
<line>To whom belongs the honor of this day?</line>
<line>Relate, I pray thee, if thy breath will serve,</line>
<line>The sad discourse of this discomfiture.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MARINER.</speaker>
<line>I will, my lord.</line>
<line>My gracious sovereign, Franch hath ta&#8217;en the foil,</line>
<line>And boasting Edward triumphs with success.</line>
<line>These iron-hearted navies,</line>
<line>When last I was reporter to your grace,</line>
<line>Both full of angry spleen, of hope, and fear,</line>
<line>Hasting to meet each other in the face,</line>
<line>At last conjoined; and by their admiral</line>
<line>Our admiral encountered many shot:</line>
<line>By this, the other, that beheld these twain</line>
<line>Give earnest penny of a further wrack,</line>
<line>Like fiery dragons took their haughty flight;</line>
<line>And, likewise meeting, from their smoky wombs</line>
<line>Sent many grim ambassadors of death.</line>
<line>Then &#8217;gan the day to turn to gloomy night,</line>
<line>And darkness did as well enclose the quick</line>
<line>As those that were but newly reft of life.</line>
<line>No leisure served for friends to bid farewell;</line>
<line>And, if it had, the hideous noise was such,</line>
<line>As each to other seemed deaf and dumb.</line>
<line>Purple the sea, whose channel filled as fast</line>
<line>With streaming gore, that from the maimed fell,</line>
<line>As did her gushing moisture break into</line>
<line>The crannied cleftures of the through shot planks.</line>
<line>Here flew a head, dissever&#8217;d from the trunk,</line>
<line>There mangled arms and legs were tossed aloft,</line>
<line>As when a whirl wind takes the summer dust</line>
<line>And scatters it in middle of the air.</line>
<line>Then might ye see the reeling vessels split,</line>
<line>And tottering sink into the ruthless flood,</line>
<line>Until their lofty tops were seen no more.</line>
<line>All shifts were tried, both for defence and hurt:</line>
<line>And now the effect of valor and of force,</line>
<line>Of resolution and of cowardice,</line>
<line>We lively pictures; how the one for fame,</line>
<line>The other by compulsion laid about;</line>
<line>Much did the Nonpareille, that brave ship;</line>
<line>So did the Black Snake of Bullen, then which</line>
<line>A bonnier vessel never yet spread sail.</line>
<line>But all in vain; both sun, the wind and tide,</line>
<line>Revolted all unto our foe men&#8217;s side,</line>
<line>That we perforce were fain to give them way,</line>
<line>And they are landed.&#8212;Thus my tale is done:</line>
<line>We have untimely lost, and they have won.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING JOHN.</speaker>
<line>Then rests there nothing, but with present speed</line>
<line>To join our several forces all in one,</line>
<line>And bid them battle, ere they range too far.</line>
<line>Come, gentle Phillip, let us hence depart;</line>
<line>This soldier&#8217;s words have pierced thy father&#8217;s heart.</line>

<line>Fly, country men and citizens of France!</line>
<line>Sweet flowering peace, the root of happy life,</line>
<line>Is quite abandoned and expulst the land;</line>
<line>Instead of whom ransacked constraining war</line>
<line>Sits like to ravens upon your houses&#8217; tops;</line>
<line>Slaughter and mischief walk within your streets,</line>
<line>And, unrestrained, make havoc as they pass;</line>
<line>The form whereof even now myself beheld</line>
<line>Upon this fair mountain whence I came.</line>
<line>For so far of as I directed mine eyes,</line>
<line>I might perceive five cities all on fire,</line>
<line>Corn fields and vineyards, burning like an oven;</line>
<line>And, as the reaking vapour in the wind</line>
<line>Turned but aside, I like wise might discern</line>
<line>The poor inhabitants, escaped the flame,</line>
<line>Fall numberless upon the soldiers&#8217; pikes.</line>
<line>Three ways these dreadful ministers of wrath</line>
<line>Do tread the measures of their tragic march:</line>
<line>Upon the right hand comes the conquering King,</line>
<line>Upon the left his hot unbridled son,</line>
<line>And in the midst our nation&#8217;s glittering host,</line>
<line>All which, though distant yet, conspire in one, </line>
<line>To leave a desolation where they come.</line>
<line>Fly therefore, citizens, if you be wise,</line>
<line>Seek out some habitation further off:</line>
<line>Here is you stay, your wives will be abused,</line>
<line>Your treasure shared before your weeping eyes;</line>

<line>Welcome, fair prince! How hast thou sped, my son,</line>
<line>Since thy arrival on the coast of France?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRINCE EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>Successfully, I thank the gracious heavens:</line>
<line>Some of their strongest cities we have won, </line>
<line>As Harflew, Lo, Crotay, and Carentigne,</line>
<line>And others wasted, leaving at our heels</line>
<line>A wide apparent field and beaten path</line>
<line>For solitariness to progress in:</line>
<line>Yet those that would submit we kindly pardoned,</line>
<line>But who in scorn refused our proffered peace,</line>
<line>Endured the penalty of sharp revenge.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>Ah, France, why shouldest thou be thus obstinate</line>
<line>Against the kind embracement of thy friends?</line>
<line>How gently had we thought to touch thy breast</line>
<line>And set our foot upon thy tender mould,</line>
<line>But that, in froward and disdainful pride,</line>
<line>Thou, like a skittish and untamed colt,</line>
<line>Dost start aside and strike us with thy heels!</line>
<line>But tell me, Ned, in all thy warlike course,</line>
<line>Hast thou not seen the usurping King of France?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRINCE EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>Yes, my good lord, and not two hours ago,</line>
<line>With full a hundred thousand fighting men&#8212;</line>
<line>Upon the one side of the river&#8217;s bank</line>
<line>And on the other both, his multitudes.</line>
<line>I feared he would have cropped our smaller power:</line>
<line>But happily, perceiving your approach,</line>
<line>He hath with drawn himself to Cressy plains;</line>
<line>Where, as it seemeth by his good array,</line>
<line>He means to bid us battle presently.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>KING JOHN.</speaker>
<line>Edward, know that John, the true king of France,</line>
<line>Musing thou shouldst encroach upon his land,</line>
<line>And in thy tyranous proceeding slay</line>
<line>His faithful subjects and subvert his towns,</line>
<line>Spits in thy face; and in this manner following</line>
<line>Obraids thee with thine arrogant intrusion:</line>
<line>First, I condemn thee for a fugitive,</line>
<line>A thievish pirate, and a needy mate,</line>
<line>One that hath either no abiding place,</line>
<line>Or else, inhabiting some barren soil,</line>
<line>Where neither herb or fruitful grain is had,</line>
<line>Doest altogether live by pilfering:</line>
<line>Next, insomuch thou hast infringed thy faith,</line>
<line>Broke league and solemn covenant made with me,</line>
<line>I hold thee for a false pernicious wretch:</line>
<line>And, last of all, although I scorn to cope</line>
<line>With one so much inferior to myself,</line>
<line>Yet, in respect thy thirst is all for gold,</line>
<line>Thy labour rather to be feared than loved,</line>
<line>To satisfy thy lust in either part,</line>
<line>Here am I come, and with me have I brought</line>
<line>Exceeding store of treasure, pearl, and coin.</line>
<line>Leave, therefore, now to persecute the weak,</line>
<line>And armed entering conflict with the armed,</line>
<line>Let it be seen, &#8217;mongst other petty thefts,</line>
<line>How thou canst win this pillage manfully.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>If gall or wormwood have a pleasant taste,</line>
<line>Then is thy salutation honey sweet;</line>
<line>But as the one hath no such property,</line>
<line>So is the other most satirical.</line>
<line>Yet wot how I regard thy worthless taunts:</line>
<line>If thou have uttered them to foil my fame</line>
<line>Or dim the reputation of my birth,</line>
<line>Know that thy wolvish barking cannot hurt;</line>
<line>If slyly to insinuate with the world,</line>
<line>And with a strumpet&#8217;s artificial line</line>
<line>To paint thy vicious and deformed cause,</line>
<line>Be well assured, the counterfeit will fade,</line>
<line>And in the end thy foul defects be seen;</line>
<line>But if thou didst it to provoke me on,</line>
<line>As who should say I were but timorous.</line>
<line>Or, coldly negligent, did need a spur,</line>
<line>Bethink thyself how slack I was at sea,</line>
<line>How since my landing I have won no towns,</line>
<line>Entered no further but upon the coast,</line>
<line>And there have ever since securely slept.</line>
<line>But if I have been other wise employed,</line>
<line>Imagine, Valois, whether I intend</line>
<line>To skirmish, not for pillage, but for the crown</line>
<line>Which thou dost wear; and that I vow to have,</line>
<line>Or one of us shall fall into his grave.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRINCE EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>Look not for cross invectives at our hands,</line>
<line>Or railing execrations of despite:</line>
<line>Let creeping serpents, hid in hollow banks,</line>
<line>Sting with their tongues; we have remorseless swords,</line>
<line>And they shall plead for us and our affairs.</line>
<line>Yet thus much, briefly, by my father&#8217;s leave:</line>
<line>As all the immodest poison of thy throat</line>
<line>Is scandalous and most notorious lies,</line>
<line>And our pretended quarrel is truly just,</line>
<line>So end the battle when we meet today:</line>
<line>May either of us prosper and prevail,</line>
<line>Or, luckless, curst, receive eternal shame!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>That needs no further question; and I know,</line>
<line>His conscience witnesseth, it is my right.&#8212;</line>
<line>Therefore, Valois, say, wilt thou yet resign,</line>
<line>Before the sickles thrust into the corn,</line>
<line>Or that inkindled fury turn to flame?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING JOHN.</speaker>
<line>Edward, I know what right thou hast in France;</line>
<line>And ere I basely will resign my crown,</line>
<line>This champion field shall be a pool of blood,</line>
<line>And all our prospect as a slaughter house.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRINCE EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>Aye, that approves thee, tyrant, what thou art:</line>
<line>No father, king, or shepherd of thy realm,</line>
<line>But one, that tears her entrails with thy hands,</line>
<line>And, like a thirsty tyger, suckst her blood.</line>

<line>Obraidst thou him, because within his face</line>
<line>Time hath ingraved deep characters of age?</line>
<line>Know, these grave scholars of experience,</line>
<line>Like stiff grown oaks, will stand immovable,</line>
<line>When whirl wind quickly turns up younger trees.</line>

<line>Five hundred years hath held the scepter up:</line>
<line>Judge then, conspiratours, by this descent,</line>
<line>Which is the true borne sovereign, this or that.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PHILIP.</speaker>
<line>Father, range your battles, prate no more;</line>
<line>These English fain would spend the time in words,</line>
<line>That, night approaching, they might escape unfought.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING JOHN.</speaker>
<line>Lords and my loving subjects, now&#8217;s the time,</line>
<line>That your intended force must bide the touch.</line>
<line>Therefore, my friends, consider this in brief:</line>
<line>He that you fight for is your natural King;</line>
<line>He against whom you fight, a foreigner:</line>
<line>He that you fight for, rules in clemency,</line>
<line>And reins you with a mild and gentle bit;</line>
<line>He against whom you fight, if he prevail,</line>
<line>Will straight inthrone himself in tyranny,</line>
<line>Makes slaves of you, and with a heavy hand</line>
<line>Curtail and curb your sweetest liberty.</line>
<line>Then, to protect your country and your King,</line>
<line>Let but the haughty courage of your hearts</line>
<line>Answer the number of your able hands,</line>
<line>And we shall quickly chase these fugitives.</line>
<line>For what&#8217;s this Edward but a belly god,</line>
<line>A tender and lascivious wantoness,</line>
<line>That thother day was almost dead for love?</line>
<line>And what, I pray you, is his goodly guard?</line>
<line>Such as, but scant them of their chines of beef</line>
<line>And take away their downy featherbeds,</line>
<line>And presently they are as resty stiff,</line>
<line>As &#8217;twere a many over ridden jades.</line>
<line>Then, Frenchmen, scorn that such should be your lords,</line>
<line>And rather bind ye them in captive bands.</line>

<line>Either to clear us of that scandalous crime,</line>
<line>Or be intombed in our innocence.</line>
<line>And, Ned, because this battle is the first</line>
<line>That ever yet thou foughtest in pitched field,</line>
<line>As ancient custom is of martialists,</line>
<line>To dub thee with the tip of chivalry,</line>
<line>In solemn manner we will give thee arms.</line>
<line>Come, therefore, heralds, orderly bring forth</line>
<line>A strong attirement for the prince my son.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter four Heralds, bringing in a coat-armor, a helmet, a lance, and a shield. The first Herald delivers the armor to King Edward, who puts it on his son.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>Edward Plantagenet, in the name of God,</line>
<line>As with this armor I impale thy breast,</line>
<line>So be thy noble unrelenting heart</line>
<line>Walled in with flint of matchless fortitude,</line>
<line>That never base affections enter there:</line>
<line>Fight and be valiant, conquer where thou comest!</line>
<line>Now follow, lords, and do him honor to.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DARBY.</speaker>
<line>Edward Plantagenet, prince of Wales,</line>
<line>As I do set this helmet on thy head,</line>
<line>Wherewith the chamber of thy brain is fenc&#8217;d,</line>
<line>So may thy temples, with Bellona&#8217;s hand,</line>
<line>Be still adorned with laurel victory:</line>
<line>Fight and be valiant, conquer where thou comest!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>AUDLEY.</speaker>
<line>Edward Plantagenet, prince of Wales,</line>
<line>Receive this lance into thy manly hand;</line>
<line>Use it in fashion of a brazen pen,</line>
<line>To draw forth bloody stratagems in France,</line>
<line>And print thy valiant deeds in honor&#8217;s book:</line>
<line>Fight and be valiant, vanquish where thou comest!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ARTOIS.</speaker>
<line>Edward Plantagenet, prince of Wales,</line>
<line>Hold, take this target, wear it on thy arm;</line>
<line>And may the view thereof, like Perseus&#8217; shield,</line>
<line>Astonish and transform thy gazing foes</line>
<line>To senseless images of meager death:</line>
<line>Fight and be valiant, conquer where thou comest!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>Now wants there nought but knighthood, which deferred</line>
<line>We leave, till thou hast won it in the field.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRINCE EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>My gracious father and ye forward peers,</line>
<line>This honor you have done me, animates</line>
<line>And cheers my green, yet scarce appearing strength</line>
<line>With comfortable good presaging signs,</line>
<line>No other wise than did old Jacob&#8217;s words,</line>
<line>When as he breathed his blessings on his sons.</line>
<line>These hallowed gifts of yours when I profane,</line>
<line>Or use them not to glory of my God,</line>
<line>To patronage the fatherless and poor,</line>
<line>Or for the benefit of England&#8217;s peace,</line>
<line>Be numb my joints, wax feeble both mine arms,</line>
<line>Wither my heart, that, like a sapless tree,</line>
<line>I may remain the map of infamy.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>Then thus our steeled battles shall be ranged:</line>
<line>The leading of the vaward, Ned, is thine;</line>
<line>To dignify whose lusty spirit the more,</line>
<line>We temper it with Audley&#8217;s gravity,</line>
<line>That, courage and experience joined in one,</line>
<line>Your manage may be second unto none:</line>
<line>For the main battles, I will guide myself;</line>
<line>And, Darby, in the rearward march behind,</line>
<line>That orderly disposed and set in ray,</line>

<stagedir>Enter Audley.</stagedir>
<line>Renowned Edward, give me leave, I pray,</line>
<line>To lead my soldiers where I may relieve</line>
<line>Your Grace&#8217;s son, in danger to be slain.</line>
<line>The snares of French, like emmets on a bank,</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>Audley, content; I will not have a man,</line>
<line>On pain of death, sent forth to succour him:</line>
<line>This is the day, ordained by destiny,</line>
<line>To season his courage with those grievous thoughts,</line>
<line>That, if he breaketh out, Nestor&#8217;s years on earth</line>

<line>Yet, good my lord, &#8217;tis too much willfulness,</line>
<line>To let his blood be spilt, that may be saved.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>Exclaim no more; for none of you can tell</line>
<line>Whether a borrowed aid will serve, or no;</line>
<line>Perhaps he is already slain or ta&#8217;en.</line>
<line>And dare a falcon when she&#8217;s in her flight, </line>
<line>And ever after she&#8217;ll be haggard like:</line>
<line>Let Edward be delivered by our hands,</line>
<line>And still, in danger, he&#8217;ll expect the like;</line>
<line>But if himself himself redeem from thence,</line>

<line>And now, behold, after my winter&#8217;s toil,</line>
<line>My painful voyage on the boisterous sea</line>
<line>Of wars devouring gulfs and steely rocks,</line>
<line>I bring my fraught unto the wished port,</line>
<line>My summer&#8217;s hope, my travels&#8217; sweet reward:</line>
<line>And here, with humble duty, I present</line>
<line>This sacrifice, this first fruit of my sword,</line>
<line>Cropped and cut down even at the gate of death,</line>
<line>The king of Boheme, father, whom I slew;</line>
<line>Whose thousands had entrenched me round about,</line>
<line>And lay as thick upon my battered crest,</line>
<line>As on an anvil, with their ponderous glaves:</line>
<line>Yet marble courage still did underprop</line>
<line>And when my weary arms, with often blows,</line>
<line>Like the continual laboring wood-man&#8217;s Axe</line>
<line>That is enjoined to fell a load of oaks,</line>
<line>Began to faulter, straight I would record</line>
<line>My gifts you gave me, and my zealous vow,</line>
<line>And then new courage made me fresh again,</line>
<line>That, in despite, I carved my passage forth,</line>
<line>And put the multitude to speedy flight.</line>
<line>Lo, thus hath Edward&#8217;s hand filled your request,</line>
<line>And done, I hope, the duty of a knight.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>Aye, well thou hast deserved a knighthood, Ned!</line>
<line>And, therefore, with thy sword, yet reaking warm</line>
<stagedir>His sword borne by a soldier.</stagedir>
<line>With blood of those that fought to be thy bane.</line>
<line>Arise, Prince Edward, trusty knight at arms:</line>
<line>This day thou hast confounded me with joy,</line>
<line>And proud thyself fit heir unto a king.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRINCE EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>Here is a note, my gracious lord, of those</line>
<line>That in this conflict of our foes were slain:</line>
<line>Eleven princes of esteem, four score barons,</line>
<line>A hundred and twenty knights, and thirty thousand</line>
<line>Common soldiers; and, of our men, a thousand.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>Our God be praised! Now, John of France, I hope,</line>
<line>Thou knowest King Edward for no wantoness,</line>
<line>No love sick cockney, nor his soldiers jades.</line>
<line>But which way is the fearful king escaped?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRINCE EDWARD.</speaker>

<line>Ned, thou and Audley shall pursue them still;</line>
<line>Myself and Derby will to Calice straight,</line>

<line>For this kind furtherance of your king and you,</line>
<line>To swear allegiance to his majesty:</line>

<stagedir>Enter Villiers.</stagedir>
<line>Villiers, thou knowest, thou art my prisoner,</line>

<line>Require of thee a hundred thousand francs,</line>
<line>Or else retain and keep thee captive still:</line>
<line>But so it is, that for a smaller charge</line>
<line>Thou mayst be quit, and if thou wilt thyself.</line>

<line>Far worse than is the quiet sleep of death:</line>
<line>We are distressed poor inhabitants,</line>
<line>That long have been diseased, sick, and lame;</line>
<line>And now, because we are not fit to serve,</line>
<line>The captain of the town hath thrust us forth,</line>
<line>That so expense of victuals may be saved.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>A charitable deed, no doubt, and worthy praise!</line>

<line>Thinking, belike, he soonest should prevail,</line>
<line>Your highness being absent from the realm,</line>
<line>Is, by the fruitful service of your peers</line>
<line>And painful travel of the Queen herself,</line>
<line>That, big with child, was every day in arms,</line>

<line>Salisbury shall not have his will so much,</line>
<line>To claim a passport how it pleaseth himself.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VILLIERS.</speaker>
<line>Why, then I know the extremity, my lord;</line>
<line>I must return to prison whence I came.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CHARLES.</speaker>
<line>Return? I hope thou wilt not;</line>
<line>What bird that hath escaped the fowler&#8217;s gin,</line>
<line>Will not beware how she&#8217;s ensnared again?</line>
<line>Or, what is he, so senseless and secure,</line>
<line>That, having hardly past a dangerous gul,</line>
<line>Will put himself in peril there again?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VILLIERS.</speaker>
<line>Ah, but it is mine oath, my gracious lord,</line>
<line>Which I in conscience may not violate,</line>
<line>Or else a kingdom should not draw me hence.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CHARLES.</speaker>
<line>Thine oath? Why, tat doth bind thee to abide:</line>
<line>Hast thou not sworn obedience to thy Prince?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VILLIERS.</speaker>
<line>In all things that uprightly he commands:</line>
<line>But either to persuade or threaten me,</line>
<line>Not to perform the covenant of my word,</line>
<line>Is lawless, and I need not to obey.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CHARLES.</speaker>
<line>Why, is it lawful for a man to kill,</line>
<line>And not, to break a promise with his foe?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VILLIERS.</speaker>
<line>To kill, my lord, when war is once proclaimed,</line>
<line>So that our quarrel be for wrongs received,</line>
<line>No doubt, is lawfully permitted us;</line>
<line>But in an oath we must be well advised,</line>
<line>How we do swear, and, when we once have sworn,</line>
<line>Not to infringe it, though we die therefore:</line>
<line>Therefore, my lord, as willing I return,</line>
<line>As if I were to fly to paradise.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CHARLES.</speaker>
<line>Stay, my Villiers; thine honorable min</line>
<line>Deserves to be eternally admired.</line>
<line>Thy suit shall be no longer thus deferred:</line>
<line>Give me the paper, I&#8217;ll subscribe to it;</line>
<line>And, wheretofore I loved thee as Villiers,</line>
<line>Hereafter, I&#8217;ll embrace thee as myself.</line>
<line>Stay, and be still in favor with thy lord.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VILLIERS.</speaker>
<line>I humbly thank you grace; I must dispatch,</line>
<line>And send this passport first unto the Earl,</line>
<line>And then I will attend your highness pleasure.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CHARLES.</speaker>
<line>Do so, Villiers;&#8212;and Charles, when he hath need,</line>
<line>Be such his soldiers, howsoever he speed!</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit Villiers.</stagedir>

<stagedir>Enter King John.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>KING JOHN.</speaker>
<line>Come, Charles, and arm thee; Edward is entrapped,</line>
<line>The Prince of Wales is fallen into our hands,</line>
<line>And we have compassed him; he cannot escape.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CHARLES.</speaker>
<line>But will your highness fight today?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING JOHN.</speaker>
<line>What else, my son? He&#8217;s scarce eight thousand strong,</line>
<line>And we are threescore thousand at the least.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CHARLES.</speaker>
<line>I have a prophecy, my gracious lord,</line>
<line>Wherein is written what success is like</line>
<line>To happen us in this outrageous war;</line>
<line>It was delivered me at Cressy&#8217;s field</line>
<line>By one that is an aged hermit there.</line>
<stagedir>Reads.</stagedir>
<line><recite>&#8220;When feathered fowl shall make thine army tremble,</recite></line>
<line><recite>And flint stones rise and break the battle ray,</recite></line>
<line><recite>Then think on him that doth not now dissemble;</recite></line>
<line><recite>For that shall be the hapless dreadful day:</recite></line>
<line><recite>Yet, in the end, thy foot thou shalt advance</recite></line>
<line><recite>As far in England as thy foe in France.&#8221;</recite></line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING JOHN.</speaker>
<line>By this it seems we shall be fortunate:</line>
<line>For as it is impossible that stones</line>
<line>Should ever rise and break the battle ray,</line>
<line>Or airy foul make men in arms to quake,</line>
<line>So is it like, we shall not be subdued:</line>
<line>Or say this might be true, yet in the end,</line>
<line>Since he doth promise we shall drive him hence</line>
<line>And forage their country as they have done ours,</line>
<line>By this revenge that loss will seem the less.</line>
<line>But all are frivolous fancies, toys, and dreams:</line>
<line>Once we are sure we have ensnared the son,</line>
<line>Catch we the father after how we can.</line>

<stagedir>Enter Prince Edward, Audley, and others.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>PRINCE EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>Audley, the arms of death embrace us round,</line>
<line>And comfort have we none, save that to die</line>
<line>We pay sower earnest for a sweeter life.</line>
<line>At Cressy&#8217;s field out clouds of warlike smoke</line>
<line>Choked up those French mouths and dissevered them;</line>
<line>But now their multitudes of millions hide,</line>
<line>Masking as twere, the beauteous burning sun,</line>
<line>Leaving no hope to us, but sullen dark</line>
<line>And eyeless terror of all ending night.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>AUDLEY.</speaker>
<line>This sudden, mighty, and expedient head</line>
<line>That they have made, fair prince, is wonderful.</line>
<line>Before us in the valley lies the king,</line>
<line>Vantaged with all that heaven and earth can yield;</line>
<line>His party stronger battled than our whole:</line>
<line>His son, the braving Duke of Normandy,</line>
<line>Hath trimmed the mountain on our right hand up</line>
<line>In shining plate, that now the aspiring hill</line>
<line>Shews like a silver quarry or an orb,</line>
<line>Aloft the which the banners, bannarets,</line>
<line>And new replenished pendants cuff the air</line>
<line>And beat the winds, that for their gaudiness</line>
<line>Struggles to kiss them: on our left hand lies</line>
<line>Phillip, the younger issue of the king,</line>
<line>Coating the other hill in such array,</line>
<line>That all his guilded upright pikes do seem</line>
<line>Straight trees of gold, the pendants leaves;</line>
<line>And their device of antique heraldry,</line>
<line>Quartered in colours, seeming sundry fruits,</line>
<line>Makes it the orchard of the Hesperides:</line>
<line>Behind us too the hill doth bear his height,</line>
<line>For like a half-moon, opening but one way,</line>
<line>It rounds us in; there at our backs are lodged</line>
<line>The fatal crossbows, and the battle there</line>
<line>Is governed by the rough Chatillion.</line>
<line>Then thus it stands: the valley for our flight</line>
<line>The king binds in; the hills on either hand</line>
<line>Are proudly royalized by his sons;</line>
<line>And on the Hill behind stands certain death</line>
<line>In pay and service with Chatillion.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRINCE EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>Death&#8217;s name is much more mighty than his deeds;</line>
<line>Thy parcelling this power hath made it more.</line>
<line>As many sands as these my hands can hold,</line>
<line>Are but my handful of so many sands;</line>
<line>Then, all the world, and call it but a power,</line>
<line>Easily ta&#8217;en up, and quickly thrown away:</line>
<line>But if I stand to count them sand by sand,</line>
<line>The number would confound my memory,</line>
<line>And make a thousand millions of a task,</line>
<line>Which briefly is no more, indeed, than one.</line>
<line>These quarters, squadrons, and these regiments,</line>
<line>Before, behind us, and on either hand,</line>
<line>Are but a power. When we name a man,</line>
<line>His hand, his foot, his head hath several strengths;</line>
<line>And being all but one self instant strength,</line>
<line>Why, all this many, Audley, is but one,</line>
<line>And we can call it all but one man&#8217;s strength.</line>
<line>He that hath far to go, tells it by miles;</line>
<line>If he should tell the steps, it kills his heart:</line>
<line>The drops are infinite, that make a flood,</line>
<line>And yet, thou knowest, we call it but a Rain.</line>
<line>There is but one France, one King of France,</line>
<line>That France hath no more kings; and that same King</line>
<line>Hath but the puissant legion of one king,</line>
<line>And we have one: then apprehend no odds,</line>
<line>For one to one is fair equality.</line>

<speaker>HERALD.</speaker>
<line>The King of France, my sovereign lord and master,</line>
<line>Greets by me his foe, the Prince of Wales:</line>
<line>If thou call forth a hundred men of name,</line>
<line>Of lords, knights, squires, and English gentlemen,</line>
<line>And with thyself and those kneel at his feet,</line>
<line>He straight will fold his bloody colours up,</line>
<line>And ransom shall redeem lives forfeited;</line>
<line>If not, this day shall drink more English blood,</line>
<line>Than ere was buried in our British earth.</line>
<line>What is the answer to his proffered mercy?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRINCE EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>This heaven, that covers France, contains the mercy</line>
<line>That draws from me submissive orizons;</line>
<line>That such base breath should vanish from my lips,</line>
<line>To urge the plea of mercy to a man,</line>
<line>The lord forbid! Return, and tell the king,</line>
<line>My tongue is made of steel, and it shall beg</line>
<line>My mercy on his coward burgonet;</line>
<line>Tell him, my colours are as red as his,</line>
<line>My men as bold, our English arms as strong:</line>
<line>Return him my defiance in his face.</line>

<speaker>HERALD.</speaker>
<line>The Duke of Normandy, my lord and master,</line>
<line>Pitying thy youth is so ingirt with peril,</line>
<line>By me hath sent a nimble-jointed jennet,</line>
<line>As swift as ever yet thou didst bestride,</line>
<line>And therewithall he counsels thee to fly;</line>
<line>Else death himself hath sworn that thou shalt die.</line>

<line>Back with the beast unto the beast that sent him!</line>
<line>Tell him I cannot sit a coward&#8217;s horse;</line>
<line>Bid him today bestride the jade himself,</line>
<line>For I will stain my horse quite o&#8217;er with blood,</line>

<line>Edward of Wales, Phillip, the second son</line>
<line>To the most mighty christian king of France,</line>
<line>Seeing thy body&#8217;s living date expired,</line>
<line>All full of charity and christian love,</line>
<line>Commends this book, full fraught with prayers,</line>
<line>To thy fair hand and for thy hour of life</line>
<line>Intreats thee that thou meditate therein,</line>
<line>And arm thy soul for her long journey towards&#8212;</line>
<line>Thus have I done his bidding, and return.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRINCE EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>Herald of Phillip, greet thy lord from me:</line>
<line>All good that he can send, I can receive;</line>
<line>But thinkst thou not, the unadvised boy</line>
<line>Hath wronged himself in thus far tendering me?</line>
<line>Happily he cannot pray without the book&#8212;</line>
<line>I think him no divine extemporall&#8212;,</line>
<line>Then render back this common place of prayer,</line>
<line>To do himself good in adversity;</line>
<line>Beside he knows not my sins&#8217; quality,</line>
<line>And therefore knows no prayers for my avail;</line>
<line>Ere night his prayer may be to pray to God,</line>
<line>To put it in my heart to hear his prayer.</line>
<line>So tell the courtly wanton, and be gone.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>PRINCE EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>How confident their strength and number makes them!&#8212;</line>
<line>Now, Audley, sound those silver wings of thine,</line>
<line>And let those milk white messengers of time</line>
<line>Shew thy times learning in this dangerous time.</line>
<line>Thy self art bruis&#8217;d and bit with many broils,</line>
<line>And stratagems forepast with iron pens</line>
<line>Are texted in thine honorable face;</line>
<line>Thou art a married man in this distress,</line>
<line>But danger woos me as a blushing maid:</line>
<line>Teach me an answer to this perilous time.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>AUDLEY.</speaker>
<line>To die is all as common as to live:</line>
<line>The one ince-wise, the other holds in chase;</line>
<line>For, from the instant we begin to live,</line>
<line>We do pursue and hunt the time to die:</line>
<line>First bud we, then we blow, and after seed,</line>
<line>Then, presently, we fall; and, as a shade</line>
<line>Follows the body, so we follow death.</line>
<line>If, then, we hunt for death, why do we fear it?</line>
<line>If we fear it, why do we follow it?</line>
<line>If we do fear, how can we shun it?</line>
<line>If we do fear, with fear we do but aide</line>
<line>The thing we fear to seize on us the sooner:</line>
<line>If we fear not, then no resolved proffer</line>
<line>Can overthrow the limit of our fate;</line>
<line>For, whether ripe or rotten, drop we shall,</line>
<line>As we do draw the lottery of our doom.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRINCE EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>Ah, good old man, a thousand thousand armors</line>
<line>These words of thine have buckled on my back:</line>
<line>Ah, what an idiot hast thou made of life,</line>
<line>To seek the thing it fears! And how disgraced</line>
<line>The imperial victory of murdering death,</line>
<line>Since all the lives his conquering arrows strike</line>
<line>Seek him, and he not them, to shame his glory!</line>
<line>I will not give a penny for a life,</line>
<line>Nor half a halfpenny to shun grim death,</line>
<line>Since for to live is but to seek to die,</line>
<line>And dying but beginning of new life.</line>
<line>Let come the hour when he that rules it will!</line>
<line>To live or die I hold indifferent.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>KING JOHN.</speaker>
<line>A sudden darkness hath defaced the sky,</line>
<line>The winds are crept into their caves for fear,</line>
<line>The leaves move not, the world is hushed and still,</line>
<line>The birds cease singing, and the wandering brooks</line>
<line>Murmur no wonted greeting to their shores;</line>
<line>Silence attends some wonder and expecteth</line>
<line>That heaven should pronounce some prophecy:</line>
<line>Where, or from whom, proceeds this silence, Charles?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CHARLES.</speaker>
<line>Our men, with open mouths and staring eyes,</line>
<line>Look on each other, as they did attend</line>
<line>Each other&#8217;s words, and yet no creature speaks;</line>
<line>A tongue-tied fear hath made a midnight hour,</line>
<line>And speeches sleep through all the waking regions.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING JOHN.</speaker>
<line>But now the pompous sun, in all his pride,</line>
<line>Looked through his golden coach upon the world,</line>

<line>That now the under earth is as a grave,</line>
<line>Dark, deadly, silent, and uncomfortable.</line>
<stagedir>A clamor of ravens.</stagedir>

<line>A flight.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>KING JOHN.</speaker>
<line>Awake thy craven powers, and tell on</line>
<line>The substance of that very fear indeed,</line>
<line>Which is so ghastly printed in thy face:</line>
<line>What is the matter?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PHILLIP.</speaker>
<line>A flight of ugly ravens</line>
<line>Do croak and hover o&#8217;er our soldiers&#8217; heads,</line>
<line>And keep in triangles and cornered squares,</line>
<line>Right as our forces are embattled;</line>
<line>With their approach there came this sudden fog,</line>
<line>Which now hath hid the airy floor of heaven</line>
<line>And made at noon a night unnatural</line>
<line>Upon the quaking and dismayed world:</line>
<line>In brief, our soldiers have let fall their arms,</line>
<line>And stand like metamorphosed images,</line>
<line>Bloodless and pale, one gazing on another.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING JOHN.</speaker>
<line>Aye, now I call to mind the prophecy,</line>
<line>But I must give no entrance to a fear.&#8212;</line>
<line>Return, and hearten up these yielding souls:</line>
<line>Tell them, the ravens, seeing them in arms,</line>
<line>So many fair against a famished few,</line>
<line>Come but to dine upon their handy work</line>
<line>And prey upon the carrion that they kill:</line>
<line>For when we see a horse laid down to die,</line>
<line>Although he be not dead, the ravenous birds</line>
<line>Sit watching the departure of his life;</line>
<line>Even so these ravens for the carcasses</line>
<line>Of those poor English, that are marked to die,</line>
<line>Hover about, and, if they cry to us,</line>
<line>&#8217;Tis but for meat that we must kill for them.</line>
<line>Away, and comfort up my soldiers,</line>
<line>And sound the trumpets, and at once dispatch</line>

<speech>
<speaker>KING JOHN.</speaker>
<line>Thou and thy word lie both in my command:</line>
<line>What canst thou promise that I cannot break?</line>
<line>Which of these twain is greater infamy,</line>
<line>To disobey thy father or thyself?</line>
<line>Thy word, nor no mans, may exceed his power;</line>
<line>Nor that same man doth never break his word,</line>
<line>That keeps it to the utmost of his power.</line>
<line>The breach of faith dwells in the soul&#8217;s consent:</line>
<line>Which if thyself without consent do break,</line>
<line>Thou art not charged with the breach of faith.</line>
<line>Go, hang him: for thy license lies in me,</line>

<line>Upon whose tall top when thy foot attains,</line>
<line>Look back upon the humble vale beneath&#8212;</line>
<line>Humble of late, but now made proud with arms&#8212;</line>

<line>Hooped with a bond of iron round about.</line>
<line>After which sight, to Callice spur amain,</line>
<line>And say, the prince was smothered and not slain:</line>
<line>And tell the king this is not all his ill;</line>

<line>Courage, Artois! A fig for feather&#8217;d shafts,</line>
<line>When feather&#8217;d fowls do bandy on our side.</line>
<line>What need we fight, and sweat, and keep a coil,</line>
<line>When railing crows outscold our adversaries?</line>
<line>Up, up, Artois! The ground itself is armed</line>
<line>With fire containing flint; command our bows</line>

<line>Our multitudes are in themselves confounded,</line>

<line>Hath buzzed a cold dismay through all our army,</line>

<line>The fear possessed abject soul to fly.</line>
<line>Myself, whose spirit is steel to their dull lead,</line>
<line>What with recalling of the prophecy,</line>

<line>Rebel against us, find myself attainted</line>

<line>Dear Audley, if my tongue ring out thy end,</line>
<line>My arms shall be thy grave: what may I do</line>
<line>To win thy life, or to revenge thy death?</line>
<line>If thou wilt drink the blood of captive kings,</line>
<line>Or that it were restorative, command</line>
<line>A health of kings&#8217; blood, and I&#8217;ll drink to thee;</line>
<line>If honor may dispense for thee with death,</line>
<line>The never dying honor of this day</line>
<line>Share wholly, Audley, to thyself, and live.</line>

<line>Victorious Prince,&#8212;that thou art so, behold</line>

<line>If I could hold him death but at a bay,</line>
<line>Till I did see my liege thy royal father,</line>
<line>My soul should yield this castle of my flesh,</line>
<line>This mangled tribute, with all willingness,</line>
<line>To darkness, consummation, dust, and worms.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRINCE EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>Cheerily, bold man, thy soul is all too proud</line>
<line>To yield her city for one little breach;</line>
<line>Should be divorced from her earthly spouse</line>

<line>Lo, to repair thy life, I give to thee</line>

<line>Contemptuous villains, call ye now for truce?</line>
<line>Mine ears are stopped against your bootless cries:&#8212;</line>
<line>Sound, drums alarum; draw threatening swords!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FIRST CITIZEN.</speaker>
<line>Ah, noble Prince, take pity on this town,</line>
<line>And hear us, mighty king:</line>
<line>We claim the promise that your highness made;</line>
<line>The two days&#8217; respite is not yet expired,</line>
<line>And we are come with willingness to bear</line>
<line>What torturing death or punishment you please,</line>
<line>So that the trembling multitude be saved.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>My promise? Well, I do confess as much:</line>
<line>But I do require the chiefest citizens</line>
<line>And men of most account that should submit;</line>
<line>You, peradventure, are but servile grooms,</line>
<line>Or some felonious robbers on the sea,</line>
<line>Whom, apprehended, law would execute,</line>
<line>Albeit severity lay dead in us:</line>
<line>No, no, ye cannot overreach us thus.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>SECOND CITIZEN.</speaker>
<line>The sun, dread lord, that in the western fall</line>
<line>Beholds us now low brought through misery,</line>
<line>Did in the Orient purple of the morn</line>
<line>Salute our coming forth, when we were known;</line>
<line>Or may our portion be with damned fiends.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>If it be so, then let our covenant stand:</line>
<line>We take possession of the town in peace,</line>
<line>But, for yourselves, look you for no remorse;</line>
<line>But, as imperial justice hath decreed,</line>
<line>Your bodies shall be dragged about these walls,</line>

<line>This is your doom;&#8212;go, soldiers, see it done.</line>

<speaker>QUEEN PHILLIP.</speaker>
<line>Ah, be more mild unto these yielding men!</line>
<line>It is a glorious thing to stablish peace,</line>

<line>By giving life and safety unto men:</line>
<line>As thou intendest to be King of France,</line>
<line>So let her people live to call thee king;</line>
<line>For what the sword cuts down or fire hath spoiled,</line>
<line>Is held in reputation none of ours.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>Although experience teach us this is true,</line>
<line>That peaceful quietness brings most delight,</line>
<line>When most of all abuses are controlled;</line>
<line>Yet, insomuch it shall be known that we</line>
<line>As well can master our affections</line>

<line>Is this the proud presumptuous esquire of the north,</line>
<line>That would not yield his prisoner to my Queen?</line>

<line>I am, my liege, a northern esquire indeed,</line>
<line>But neither proud nor insolent, I trust.</line>

<speech>

<line>What moved thee, then, to be so obstinate</line>
<line>To contradict our royal Queen&#8217;s desire?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>COPLAND.</speaker>
<line>No wilful disobedience, mighty lord,</line>
<line>But my desert and public law at arms:</line>
<line>I took the king myself in single fight,</line>
<line>And, like a soldiers, would be loath to lose</line>
<line>The least pre-eminence that I had won.</line>
<line>And Copland straight upon your highness&#8217; charge</line>
<line>Is come to France, and with a lowly mind</line>
<line>Doth vale the bonnet of his victory:</line>
<line>Receive, dread lord, the custom of my fraught,</line>
<line>The wealthy tribute of my laboring hands,</line>
<line>Which should long since have been surrendered up,</line>
<line>Had but your gracious self been there in place.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>COPLAND.</speaker>
<line>His name I reverence, but his person more;</line>
<line>His name shall keep me in allegiance still,</line>
<line>But to his person I will bend my knee.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>I pray thee, Phillip, let displeasure pass;</line>
<line>This man doth please me, and I like his words:</line>
<line>For what is he that will attempt great deeds,</line>
<line>And lose the glory that ensues the same?</line>
<line>All rivers have recourse unto the sea,</line>
<line>And Copland&#8217;s faith relation to his king.</line>
<line>Kneel, therefore, down: now rise, king Edward&#8217;s knight;</line>

<line>Protesting true allegiance to your Grace.</line>

<line>We thank thee for thy service, valiant Earl;</line>
<line>Challenge our favor, for we owe it thee.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SALISBURY.</speaker>
<line>But now, my lord, as this is joyful news,</line>
<line>So must my voice be tragical again,</line>
<line>And I must sing of doleful accidents.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>What, have our men the overthrow at Poictiers?</line>
<line>Or is our son beset with too much odds?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SALISBURY.</speaker>
<line>He was, my lord: and as my worthless self</line>
<line>With forty other serviceable knights,</line>
<line>Under safe conduct of the Dauphin&#8217;s seal,</line>
<line>Did travail that way, finding him distressed,</line>
<line>A troop of lances met us on the way,</line>
<line>Surprised, and brought us prisoners to the king,</line>
<line>Who, proud of this, and eager of revenge,</line>
<line>Commanded straight to cut off all our heads:</line>
<line>And surely we had died, but that the Duke,</line>
<line>More full of honor than his angry sire,</line>
<line>Procured our quick deliverance from thence;</line>
<line>But, ere we went, &#8220;Salute your king,&#8221; quoth he,</line>
<line>&#8220;Bid him provide a funeral for his son:</line>
<line>To day our sword shall cut his thread of life;</line>
<line>And, sooner than he thinks, we&#8217;ll be with him,</line>
<line>To quittance those displeasures he hath done.&#8221;</line>
<line>This said, we past, not daring to reply;</line>
<line>Our hearts were dead, our looks diffused and wan.</line>
<line>Wandering, at last we climed unto a hill,</line>
<line>From whence, although our grief were much before,</line>
<line>Yet now to see the occasion with our eyes</line>
<line>Did thrice so much increase our heaviness:</line>
<line>For there, my lord, oh, there we did descry</line>
<line>Down in a valley how both armies lay.</line>
<line>The French had cast their trenches like a ring,</line>
<line>And every barricado&#8217;s open front</line>
<line>Was thick embossed with brazen ordinance;</line>
<line>Here stood a battaile of ten thousand horse,</line>
<line>There twice as many pikes in quadrant wise,</line>
<line>Here crossbows, and deadly wounding darts:</line>
<line>And in the midst, like to a slender point</line>
<line>Within the compass of the horizon,</line>
<line>(As twere a rising bubble in the sea,</line>
<line>A hazle wand amidst a wood of pines,</line>
<line>Or as a bear fast chained unto a stake),</line>
<line>Stood famous Edward, still expecting when</line>
<line>Those dogs of France would fasten on his flesh.</line>
<line>Anon the death procuring knell begins:</line>
<line>Off go the cannons, that with trembling noise</line>
<line>Did shake the very mountain where they stood;</line>
<line>Then sound the trumpets&#8217; clangor in the air,</line>
<line>The battles join: and, when we could no more</line>
<line>Discern the difference twixt the friend and foe,</line>
<line>So intricate the dark confusion was,</line>
<line>Away we turned our watery eyes with sighs,</line>
<line>As black as powder fuming into smoke.</line>
<line>And thus, I fear, unhappy have I told</line>
<line>The most untimely tale of Edward&#8217;s fall.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>QUEEN PHILLIP.</speaker>
<line>Ah me, is this my welcome into France?</line>
<line>Is this the comfort that I looked to have,</line>
<line>When I should meet with my beloved son?</line>
<line>Sweet Ned, I would thy mother in the sea</line>
<line>Had been prevented of this mortal grief!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>Content thee, Phillip; &#8217;tis not tears will serve</line>
<line>To call him back, if he be taken hence:</line>
<line>Comfort thyself, as I do, gentle Queen,</line>
<line>With hope of sharp, unheard of, dire revenge.&#8212;</line>
<line>He bids me to provide his funeral,</line>
<line>And so I will; but all the peers in France</line>
<line>Shall mourners be, and weep out bloody tears,</line>
<line>Until their empty veins be dry and sere:</line>
<line>The pillars of his hearse shall be his bones;</line>
<line>The mould that covers him, their city ashes;</line>
<line>His knell, the groaning cries of dying men;</line>
<line>And, in the stead of tapers on his tomb,</line>
<line>An hundred fifty towers shall burning blaze,</line>
<line>While we bewail our valiant son&#8217;s decease.</line>

<line>Install your highness in your proper right:</line>
<line>And, herewithall, I render to your hands</line>
<line>These prisoners, chief occasion of our strife.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>So, John of France, I see you keep your word:</line>
<line>You promised to be sooner with our self</line>
<line>Than we did think for, and &#8217;tis so indeed:</line>
<line>But, had you done at first as now you do,</line>
<line>How many civil towns had stood untouched,</line>
<line>That now are turned to ragged heaps of stones!</line>
<line>How many people&#8217;s lives mightst thou have saved,</line>
<line>That are untimely sunk into their graves!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING JOHN.</speaker>
<line>Edward, recount not things irrevocable;</line>
<line>Tell me what ransom thou requirest to have.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>Thy ransom, John, hereafter shall be known:</line>
<line>But first to England thou must cross the seas,</line>
<line>To see what entertainment it affords;</line>
<line>How ere it falls, it cannot be so bad,</line>
<line>As ours hath been since we arrived in France.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING JOHN.</speaker>
<line>Accursed man! Of this I was foretold,</line>
<line>But did misconster what the prophet told.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRINCE EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>Now, father, this petition Edward makes</line>
<line>To thee, whose grace hath been his strongest shield,</line>
<line>That, as thy pleasure chose me for the man</line>
<line>To be the instrument to shew thy power,</line>
<line>So thou wilt grant that many princes more,</line>
<line>Bred and brought up within that little Isle,</line>
<line>May still be famous for like victories!</line>
<line>And, for my part, the bloody scars I bear,</line>
<line>And weary nights that I have watched in field,</line>
<line>The dangerous conflicts I have often had,</line>
<line>The fearful menaces were proffered me,</line>
<line>The heat and cold and what else might displease:</line>
<line>I wish were now redoubled twenty fold,</line>
<line>So that hereafter ages, when they read</line>
<line>The painful traffic of my tender youth,</line>
<line>Might thereby be inflamed with such resolve,</line>
<line>As not the territories of France alone,</line>
<line>But likewise Spain, Turkey, and what countries else</line>
<line>That justly would provoke fair England&#8217;s ire,</line>
<line>Might, at their presence, tremble and retire.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>KING EDWARD.</speaker>
<line>Here, English lords, we do proclaim a rest,</line>
<line>An intercession of our painful arms:</line>
<line>Sheath up your swords, refresh your weary limbs,</line>
<line>Peruse your spoils; and, after we have breathed</line>
<line>A day or two within this haven town,</line>
<line>God willing, then for England we&#8217;ll be shipped;</line>
<line>Where, in a happy hour, I trust, we shall</line>
<line>Arrive, three kings, two princes, and a queen.</line>
