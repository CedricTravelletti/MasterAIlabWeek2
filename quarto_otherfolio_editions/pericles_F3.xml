<LINE>Hee's more &#383;ecure to keepe it &#383;hut, then &#383;howne.</LINE>
<LINE>For Vice repeated, is like the wandring Wind,</LINE>
<LINE>Blowes dust in others eyes to &#383;pread it &#383;elfe;</LINE>
<LINE>And yet the end of all is bought thus deare,</LINE>
<LINE>The breath is gone, and the &#383;ore eyes &#383;ee cleare:</LINE>
<LINE>To &#383;top the Ayre would hurt them, the blind Mole castes</LINE>
<LINE>Copt hilles towards heauen, to tell the earth is throng&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>By mans oppre&#383;&#383;ion, and the poore Worme doth die for't:</LINE>
<LINE>Kinges are earths Gods; in vice, their law's their will:</LINE>
<LINE>And if Ioue &#383;tray, who dares &#383;ay, Ioue doth ill:</LINE>
<LINE>It is enough you know, and it is fit;</LINE>
<LINE>What being more knowne, growes worse, to &#383;mother it.</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Peri.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How courtesie would &#383;eeme to couer &#383;inne,</LINE>

<LINE>The which is good in nothing but in &#383;ight.</LINE>
<LINE>If it be true that I interpret false,</LINE>
<LINE>Then were it certaine you were not &#383;o bad,</LINE>
<LINE>As with foule Incest to abuse your &#383;oule:</LINE>
<LINE>Where now you both a Father and a Sonne,</LINE>
<LINE>By your vntimely claspings with your Child,</LINE>
<LINE>(Which pleasures fittes a husband, not a father)</LINE>
<LINE>And &#383;hee an eater of her Mothers flesh,</LINE>
<LINE>By the defiling of her Parents bed,</LINE>

<LINE>farewell, for Wisedome &#383;ees those men, Blush not in actions blacker then the night, Will &#383;hew no course to keepe them from the light: One &#383;inne (I know) another doth prouoke; Murther's as neere to Lust, as Flame to Smoake: Poyson and Treason are the hands of Sinne, I, and the targets to put off the &#383;hame, Then least my life be cropt, to keepe you cleare, By flight, Ile &#383;hun the danger which I feare. <STAGEDIR>Exit.</STAGEDIR></LINE>

<LINE>Nor tell the world Antiochus doth &#383;inne</LINE>
<LINE>In &#383;uch a loathed manner:</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Pe.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let none disturb vs, why &#383;hold this cha[n]ge of thoughts The &#383;ad companion dull eyde melancholie, By me &#383;o vsde a guest, as not an houre In the dayes glorious walke or peacefull night, The tombe where griefe &#383;hould &#383;leepe can breed me quiet, Here pleasures court mine eies, and mine eies &#383;hun them, And daunger which I fearde is at Antioch, Whose arme &#383;eemes farre too &#383;hort to hit me here, Yet neither pleasures Art can ioy my &#383;pirits, Nor yet the others distance comfort me, Then it is thus, the pa&#383;&#383;ions of the mind, That haue their first conception by misdread, Haue after nourishment and life, by care And what was first but feare, what might be done, Growes elder now, and cares it be not done. And &#383;o with me the great Antiochus, Gainst whom I am too little to contend. Since hee's &#383;o great, can make his will his act, Will thinke me &#383;peaking, though I &#383;weare to &#383;ilence, Nor bootes it me to &#383;ay, I honour, If he &#383;uspect I may dishonour him. And what may make him blush in being knowne, Heele &#383;top the course by which it might be knowne, With hostile forces heele ore-spread the land, And with the &#383;tint of warre will looke &#383;o huge, Amazement &#383;hall driue courage from the &#383;tate, Our men be vanquisht ere they doe resist, And &#383;ubiects punisht that nere thought offence, Which care of them, not pittie of my &#383;elfe, Who once no more but as the tops of trees, Which fence the rootes they grow by and defend them, Makes both my bodie pine, and &#383;oule to languish, And punish that before that he would punish. <STAGEDIR>Enter all the Lords to Pericles.</STAGEDIR> 1. Lord. Ioy and all comfort in your &#383;acred brest. 2. Lord. And keepe your mind till you returne to vs peacefull and comfortable.</LINE>

<LINE>For flatterie is the bellowes blowes vp &#383;inne,</LINE>

<LINE>To which that &#383;parke giues heate, and &#383;tronger</LINE>
<LINE>Glowing, whereas reproofe obedient and in order,</LINE>
<LINE>Fits kings as they are men, for they may erre,</LINE>

<LINE>He flatters you, makes warre vpon your life.</LINE>

Tyre I now looke from thee then, and to Tharsus Intend my trauaile, where Ile heare from thee, And by whose Letters Ile dispose my &#383;elfe. The care I had and haue of &#383;ubiects good, On thee I lay, whose wisdomes &#383;trength can beare it, Ile take thy word, for faith, not aske thine oath, Who &#383;huns not to breake one, will cracke both. But in our orbs will liue &#383;o round, and &#383;afe, That time of both this truth &#383;hall nere conuince, Thou &#383;hewdst a &#383;ubiects &#383;hine, I a true Prince. <STAGEDIR>Exit.</STAGEDIR> <STAGEDIR>Enter Thaliard &#383;olus.</STAGEDIR> So this is Tyre, and this the Court, heere must I kill King Pericles, and if I doe it not, I am &#383;ure to be hang&#8217;d at home: t'is daungerous. Well, I perceiue he was a wise fellowe, and had good discretion, that beeing bid to aske what hee would of the King, desired he might knowe none of his &#383;ecrets. Now doe I &#383;ee hee had &#383;ome reason for't: for if a king bidde a man bee a villaine, hee's bound by the inden-ture of his oath to bee one. Husht, heere comes the Lords of Tyre. <STAGEDIR>Enter Hellicanus, Escanes, with</STAGEDIR> other Lords.</LINE>
