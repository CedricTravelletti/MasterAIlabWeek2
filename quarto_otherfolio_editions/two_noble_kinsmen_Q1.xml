<LINE>New Playes, and Maydenheads, are neare a kin,</LINE>
<LINE>Much follow'd both, for both much mony g'yn,</LINE>
<LINE>If they stand sound, and well: And a good Play</LINE>
<LINE>(Whose modest Sceanes blush on his marriage day,</LINE>
<LINE>And shake to loose his honour) is like hir</LINE>
<LINE>That after holy Tye, and first nights stir</LINE>
<LINE>Yet still is Modestie, and still retaines</LINE>
<LINE>More of the maid to sight, than Husbands paines;</LINE>
<LINE>We pray our Play may be so; For I am sure</LINE>
<LINE>It has a noble Breeder, and a pure,</LINE>
<LINE>A learned, and a Poet never went</LINE>
<LINE>More famous yet twixt Po and silver Trent.</LINE>
<LINE>Chaucer (of all admir'd) the Story gives,</LINE>
<LINE>There constant to Eternity it lives;</LINE>
<LINE>If we let fall the Noblenesse of this,</LINE>
<LINE>And the first sound this child heare, be a hisse,</LINE>
<LINE>How will it shake the bones of that good man,</LINE>
<LINE>And make him cry from under ground, O fan</LINE>
<LINE>For to say Truth, it were an endlesse thing,</LINE>
<LINE>And too ambitious to aspire to him;</LINE>
<LINE>Weake as we are, and almost breath lesse swim</LINE>
<LINE>In this deepe water. Do but you hold out</LINE>
<LINE>Your helping hands, and we shall take about,</LINE>
<LINE>And something doe to save us: You shall heare</LINE>
<LINE>Sceanes though below his Art, may yet appeare</LINE>
<LINE>A little dull time from us, we perceave</LINE>
<LINE>Our losses fall so thicke, we must needs leave.</LINE>

<LINE>Deere Palamon, deerer in love then Blood</LINE>
<LINE>And our prime Cosen, yet unhardned in</LINE>
<LINE>The Crimes of nature; Let us leave the Citty</LINE>
<LINE>Thebs, and the temptings in't, before we further</LINE>
<LINE>Sully our glosse of youth,</LINE>
<LINE>And here to keepe in abstinence we shame</LINE>
<LINE>As in Incontinence; for not to swim</LINE>
<LINE>I'th aide o'th Current, were almost to sincke,</LINE>
<LINE>At least to frustrate striving, and to follow</LINE>
<LINE>The common Streame, twold bring us to an Edy</LINE>

<LINE>Our gaine but life, and weakenes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Pal.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your advice</LINE>
<LINE>Is cride up with example; what strange ruins</LINE>
<LINE>Since first we went to Schoole, may we perceive</LINE>
<LINE>Walking in Thebs? Skars, and bare weedes</LINE>
<LINE>The gaine o'th Martialist, who did propound</LINE>
<LINE>To his bold ends, honour, and golden Ingots,</LINE>
<LINE>Which though he won, he had not, and now flurted</LINE>
<LINE>By peace for whom he fought, who then shall offer</LINE>
<LINE>To Marsis so scornd Altar? I doe bleede</LINE>
<LINE>When such I meete, and with great Iuno would</LINE>
<LINE>Resume her ancient fit of Ielouzie</LINE>
<LINE>To get the Soldier worke, that peace might purge</LINE>
<LINE>For her repletion, and retaine anew</LINE>
<LINE>Her charitable heart now hard, and harsher</LINE>
<LINE>Then strife, or war could be.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Arcite.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Are you not out?</LINE>
<LINE>Meete you no ruine, but the Soldier in</LINE>
<LINE>The Cranckes, and turnes of Thebs? you did begin</LINE>
<LINE>As if you met decaies of many kindes:</LINE>
<LINE>Perceive you none, that doe arowse your pitty</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Arcite.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tis not this</LINE>
<LINE>I did begin to speake of: This is vertue</LINE>
<LINE>Of no respect in Thebs, I spake of Thebs</LINE>
<LINE>How dangerous if we will keepe our Honours,</LINE>
<LINE>It is for our resyding, where every evill</LINE>
<LINE>Hath a good cullor; where eve'ry seeming good's</LINE>
<LINE>A certaine evill, where not to be ev'n Iumpe</LINE>
<LINE>As they are, here were to be strangers, and</LINE>
<LINE>Such things to be meere Monsters.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Pal.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tis in our power,</LINE>
<LINE>(Vnlesse we feare that Apes can Tutor's) to</LINE>
<LINE>Be Masters of our manners: what neede I</LINE>
<LINE>Affect anothers gate, which is not catching</LINE>
<LINE>Where there is faith, or to be fond upon</LINE>
<LINE>Anothers way of speech, when by mine owne</LINE>
<LINE>I may be reasonably conceiv'd; sav'd too,</LINE>
<LINE>Speaking it truly; why am I bound</LINE>
<LINE>By any generous bond to follow him</LINE>
<LINE>Followes his Taylor, haply so long untill</LINE>
<LINE>The follow'd, make pursuit? or let me know,</LINE>
<LINE>Why mine owne Barber is unblest, with him</LINE>
<LINE>My poore Chinne too, for tis not Cizard iust</LINE>
<LINE>To such a Favorites glasse: What Cannon is there</LINE>
<LINE>That does command my Rapier from my hip</LINE>
<LINE>To dangle't in my hand, or to go tip toe</LINE>
<LINE>Before the streete be foule? Either I am</LINE>
<LINE>The fore-horse in the Teame, or I am none</LINE>

<SPEAKER>Pal.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He,</LINE>
<LINE>A most unbounded Tyrant, whose successes</LINE>
<LINE>Makes heaven unfeard, and villany assured</LINE>
<LINE>Beyond its power: there's nothing, almost puts</LINE>
<LINE>Faith in a feavour, and deifies alone</LINE>
<LINE>Voluble chance, who onely attributes</LINE>
<LINE>The faculties of other Instruments</LINE>
<LINE>To his owne Nerves and act; Commands men service,</LINE>
<LINE>And what they winne in't, boot and glory on;</LINE>
<LINE>That feares not to do harm; good, dares not; Let</LINE>
<LINE>The blood of mine that's sibbe to him, be suckt</LINE>
<LINE>From me with Leeches, Let them breake and fall</LINE>
<LINE>Off me with that corruption.</LINE>

<LINE>I (seeing) thought he was a goodly man;</LINE>
<LINE>He has as much to please a woman in him,</LINE>
<LINE>(If he please to bestow it so) as ever</LINE>
<LINE>These eyes yet lookt on; Next, I pittied him,</LINE>
<LINE>And so would any young wench o'my Conscience</LINE>
<LINE>That ever dream'd, or vow'd her Maydenhead</LINE>
<LINE>To a yong hansom Man; Then I lov'd him,</LINE>
<LINE>(Extreamely lov'd him) infinitely lov'd him;</LINE>
<LINE>And yet he had a Cosen, faire as he too.</LINE>
<LINE>But in my heart was Palamon, and there</LINE>
<LINE>Lord, what a coyle he keepes? To heare him</LINE>
<LINE>Sing in an evening, what a heaven it is?</LINE>
<LINE>And yet his Songs are sad-ones; Fairer spoken,</LINE>
<LINE>Was never Gentleman. When I come in</LINE>
<LINE>To bring him water in a morning, first</LINE>
<LINE>He bowes his noble body, then salutes me, thus:</LINE>
<LINE>Faire, gentle Mayde, good morrow, may thy goodnes,</LINE>
<LINE>Get thee a happy husband; Once he kist me,</LINE>
<LINE>I lov'd my lips the better ten daies after,</LINE>
<LINE>Would he would doe so ev'ry day; He greives much,</LINE>
<LINE>And me as much to see his misery.</LINE>
<LINE>What should I doe, to make him know I love him,</LINE>
<LINE>For I would faine enjoy him? Say I ventur'd</LINE>
<LINE>To set him free? what saies the law then? Thus much</LINE>
<LINE>For Law, or kindred: I will doe it,</LINE>
<LINE>And this night, or to morrow he shall love me.</LINE>

<LINE>Fast by a Brooke, and there he shall keepe close,</LINE>
<LINE>Till I provide him Fyles, and foode, for yet</LINE>
<LINE>His yron bracelets are not off. O Love</LINE>
<LINE>What a stout hearted child thou art! My Father</LINE>
<LINE>Durst better have indur'd cold yron, than done it:</LINE>
<LINE>I love him, beyond love, and beyond reason,</LINE>
<LINE>Or wit, or safetie: I have made him know it</LINE>
<LINE>I care not, I am desperate, If the law</LINE>
<LINE>Finde me, and then condemne me for't; some wenches,</LINE>
<LINE>Some honest harted Maides, will sing my Dirge.</LINE>
<LINE>And tell to memory, my death was noble,</LINE>
<LINE>Dying almost a Martyr: That way he takes,</LINE>
<LINE>I purpose is my way too: Sure he cannot</LINE>
<LINE>Be so unmanly, as to leave me here,</LINE>
<LINE>If he doe, Maides will not so easily</LINE>
<LINE>Trust men againe: And yet he has not thank'd me</LINE>
<LINE>For what I have done: no not so much as kist me,</LINE>
<LINE>And that (me thinkes) is not so well; nor scarcely</LINE>
<LINE>Could I perswade him to become a Freeman,</LINE>
<LINE>He made such scruples of the wrong he did</LINE>
<LINE>To me, and to my Father. Yet I hope</LINE>
<LINE>When he considers more, this love of mine</LINE>
<LINE>Will take more root within him: Let him doe</LINE>
<LINE>What he will with me, so he use me kindly,</LINE>
<LINE>For use me so he shall, or ile proclaime him</LINE>
<LINE>And to his face, no-man: Ile presently</LINE>
<LINE>Provide him necessaries, and packe my cloathes up,</LINE>
<LINE>And where there is a path of ground Ile venture</LINE>
<LINE>So hee be with me; By him, like a shadow</LINE>
<LINE>Ile ever dwell; within this houre the whoobub</LINE>
<LINE>Will be all ore the prison: I am then</LINE>
<LINE>Kissing the man they looke for: farewell Father;</LINE>

Scaena 2. Enter Emilia alone, with 2. Pictures.</LINE>


<LINE>And end their strife: Two such yong hansom men</LINE>
<LINE>Shall never fall for me, their weeping Mothers,</LINE>
<LINE>Following the dead cold ashes of their Sonnes</LINE>
<LINE>Shall never curse my cruelty: Good heaven,</LINE>
<LINE>What a sweet face has Arcite? If wise nature</LINE>
<LINE>With all her best endowments, all those beuties</LINE>
<LINE>She sowes into the birthes of noble bodies,</LINE>
<LINE>Were here a mortall woman, and had in her</LINE>
<LINE>The coy denialls of yong Maydes, yet doubtles,</LINE>
<LINE>She would run mad for this man: what an eye?</LINE>
<LINE>Of what a fyry sparkle, and quick sweetnes,</LINE>
<LINE>Has this yong Prince? Here Love himselfe sits smyling,</LINE>
<LINE>Iust such another wanton Ganimead,</LINE>
<LINE>Set Love a fire with, and enforcd the god</LINE>
<LINE>Snatch up the goodly Boy, and set him by him</LINE>
<LINE>A shining constellation: What a brow,</LINE>
<LINE>Of what a spacious Majesty he carries?</LINE>
<LINE>Arch'd like the great eyd Iuno's, but far sweeter,</LINE>
<LINE>Smoother then Pelops Shoulder? Fame and honour</LINE>
<LINE>Me thinks from hence, as from a Promontory</LINE>
<LINE>Pointed in heaven, should clap their wings, and sing</LINE>
<LINE>To all the under world, the Loves, and Fights</LINE>
<LINE>Of gods, and such men neere 'em. Palamon,</LINE>
<LINE>Is but his foyle, to him, a meere dull shadow,</LINE>
<LINE>Hee's swarth, and meagre, of an eye as heavy</LINE>
<LINE>As if he had lost his mother; a still temper,</LINE>
<LINE>No stirring in him, no alacrity,</LINE>
<LINE>Of all this sprightly sharpenes, not a smile;</LINE>
<LINE>Yet these that we count errours may become him:</LINE>
<LINE>Narcissus was a sad Boy, but a heavenly:</LINE>
<LINE>Oh who can finde the bent of womans fancy?</LINE>
<LINE>I am a Foole, my reason is lost in me,</LINE>
<LINE>I have no choice, and I have ly'd so lewdly</LINE>
<LINE>That women ought to beate me. On my knees</LINE>
<LINE>I aske thy pardon: Palamon, thou art alone,</LINE>
<LINE>And only beutifull, and these the eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>These the bright lamps of beauty, that command</LINE>
<LINE>And threaten Love, and what yong Mayd dare crosse 'em</LINE>
<LINE>What a bold gravity, and yet inviting</LINE>
<LINE>Has this browne manly face? O Love, this only</LINE>
<LINE>From this howre is Complexion: Lye there Arcite,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou art a changling to him, a meere Gipsey.</LINE>
<LINE>And this the noble Bodie: I am sotted,</LINE>
<LINE>Vtterly lost: My Virgins faith has fled me.</LINE>
<LINE>For if my brother but even now had ask'd me</LINE>
<LINE>Whether I lov'd, I had run mad for Arcite,</LINE>
<LINE>Now if my Sister; More for Palamon,</LINE>
<LINE>Stand both together: Now, come aske me Brother,</LINE>
<LINE>Alas, I know not: aske me now sweet Sister,</LINE>
<LINE>I may goe looke; What a meere child is Fancie,</LINE>
<LINE>That having two faire gawdes of equall sweetnesse,</LINE>
<LINE>Cannot distinguish, but must crie for both.</LINE>

<LINE>That my unspotted youth must now be soyld</LINE>
<LINE>With blood of Princes? and my Chastitie</LINE>
<LINE>Be made the Altar, where the lives of Lovers,</LINE>
<LINE>Two greater, and two better never yet</LINE>
<LINE>Made mothers joy, must be the sacrifice</LINE>
<LINE>To my unhappy Beautie?</LINE>

<LINE>I a while.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Gent.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And I.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Thes.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>From whence come you Sir?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Mess.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>From the Knights.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Thes.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pray speake</LINE>
<LINE>You that have seene them, what they are.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Mess.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will Sir.</LINE>
<LINE>And truly what I thinke: Six braver spirits</LINE>
<LINE>Then these they have brought, (if we judge by the outside)</LINE>
<LINE>I never saw, nor read of. He that stands</LINE>
<LINE>In the first place with Arcite, by his seeming</LINE>
<LINE>Should be a stout man, by his face a Prince,</LINE>
<LINE>(His very lookes so say him) his complexion,</LINE>
<LINE>Nearer a browne, than blacke; sterne, and yet noble,</LINE>
<LINE>Which shewes him hardy, fearelesse, proud of dangers:</LINE>
<LINE>The circles of his eyes show faire within him,</LINE>
<LINE>And as a heated Lyon, so he lookes;</LINE>
<LINE>His haire hangs long behind him, blacke and shining</LINE>
<LINE>Like Ravens wings: his shoulders broad, and strong,</LINE>
<LINE>Armd long and round, and on his Thigh a Sword</LINE>
<LINE>Hung by a curious Bauldricke; when he frownes</LINE>
<LINE>To seale his will with, better o'my conscience</LINE>
<LINE>Was never Souldiers friend.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Thes.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou ha'st well describde him,</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Per.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yet a great deale short</LINE>
<LINE>Me thinkes, of him that's first with Palamon.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Thes.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pray speake him friend.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Per.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I ghesse he is a Prince too,</LINE>
<LINE>And if it may be, greater; for his show</LINE>
<LINE>Has all the ornament of honour in't:</LINE>
<LINE>Hee's somewhat bigger, then the Knight he spoke of,</LINE>
<LINE>But of a face far sweeter; His complexion</LINE>
<LINE>Is (as a ripe grape) ruddy: he has felt</LINE>
<LINE>Without doubt what he fights for, and so apter</LINE>
<LINE>To make this cause his owne: In's face appeares</LINE>
<LINE>All the faire hopes of what he undertakes,</LINE>
<LINE>And when he's angry, then a setled valour</LINE>
<LINE>(Not tainted with extreames) runs through his body,</LINE>
<LINE>And guides his arme to brave things: Feare he cannot,</LINE>
<LINE>He shewes no such soft temper, his head's yellow,</LINE>
<LINE>Hard hayr'd, and curld, thicke twind like Ivy tops,</LINE>
<LINE>Not to undoe with thunder; In his face</LINE>
<LINE>The liverie of the warlike Maide appeares,</LINE>
<LINE>Pure red, and white, for yet no beard has blest him.</LINE>
<LINE>And in his rowling eyes, sits victory,</LINE>
<LINE>As if she ever ment to corect his valour:</LINE>
<LINE>His Nose stands high, a Character of honour.</LINE>
<LINE>His red lips, after fights, are fit for Ladies.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Emil.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Must these men die too?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Per.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>When he speakes, his tongue</LINE>
<LINE>Sounds like a Trumpet; All his lyneaments</LINE>
<LINE>Are as a man would wish 'em, strong, and cleane,</LINE>
<LINE>He weares a well-steeld Axe, the staffe of gold,</LINE>
<LINE>His age some five and twenty.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Mess.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ther's another,</LINE>
<LINE>A little man, but of a tough soule, seeming</LINE>
<LINE>As great as any: fairer promises</LINE>
<LINE>In such a Body, yet I never look'd on.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Per.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, he that's freckle fac'd?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Mess.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The same my Lord,</LINE>
<LINE>Are they not sweet ones?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Per.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes they are well.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Mess.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Me thinkes,</LINE>
<LINE>Being so few, and well disposd, they show</LINE>
<LINE>Great, and fine art in nature, he's white hair'd,</LINE>
<LINE>Not wanton white, but such a manly colour</LINE>
<LINE>Next to an aborne, tough, and nimble set,</LINE>
<LINE>Which showes an active soule; his armes are brawny</LINE>
<LINE>Linde with strong sinewes: To the shoulder peece,</LINE>
<LINE>Gently they swell, like women new conceav'd,</LINE>
<LINE>Which speakes him prone to labour, never fainting</LINE>
<LINE>Vnder the waight of Armes; stout harted, still,</LINE>
<LINE>But when he stirs, a Tiger; he's gray eyd,</LINE>
<LINE>Which yeelds compassion where he conquers: sharpe</LINE>
<LINE>To spy advantages, and where he finds 'em,</LINE>
<LINE>He's swift to make 'em his: He do's no wrongs,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor takes none; he's round fac'd, and when he smiles</LINE>
<LINE>He showes a Lover, when he frownes, a Souldier:</LINE>
<LINE>About his head he weares the winners oke,</LINE>
<LINE>And in it stucke the favour of his Lady:</LINE>
<LINE>His age, some six and thirtie. In his hand</LINE>
<LINE>He beares a charging Staffe, embost with silver.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Thes.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Are they all thus?</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>I wish it,</LINE>
<LINE>But not the cause my Lord; They would show</LINE>
<LINE>Bravely about the Titles of two Kingdomes;</LINE>
<LINE>Tis pitty Love should be so tyrannous:</LINE>
<LINE>O my soft harted Sister, what thinke you?</LINE>
<LINE>Weepe not, till they weepe blood; Wench it must be.</LINE>

<LINE>Same tearmes.</LINE>
<LINE>Execute their preordaind faculties, but they are</LINE>
<LINE>Now in a most extravagant vagary. This you</LINE>
<LINE>Must doe, Confine her to a place, where the light</LINE>
<LINE>May rather seeme to steale in, then be permitted; take</LINE>
<LINE>Vpon you (yong Sir her friend) the name of</LINE>
<LINE>Palamon, say you come to eate with her, and to</LINE>
<LINE>Commune of Love; this will catch her attention, for</LINE>
<LINE>This her minde beates upon; other objects that are</LINE>
<LINE>Inserted tweene her minde and eye, become the prankes</LINE>
<LINE>And friskins of her madnes; Sing to her, such greene</LINE>
<LINE>Songs of Love, as she sayes Palamon hath sung in</LINE>
<LINE>Prison; Come to her, stucke in as sweet flowers, as the</LINE>
<LINE>Season is mistres of, and thereto make an addition of</LINE>
<LINE>Som other compounded odours, which are grateful to the</LINE>
<LINE>Sence: all this shall become Palamon, for Palamon can</LINE>
<LINE>Sing, and Palamon is sweet, and ev'ry good thing, desire</LINE>
<LINE>To eate with her, crave her, drinke to her, and still</LINE>
<LINE>Among, intermingle your petition of grace and acceptance</LINE>
<LINE>Into her favour: Learne what Maides have beene her</LINE>
<LINE>Companions, and play-pheeres, and let them repaire to</LINE>
<LINE>Her with Palamon in their mouthes, and appeare with</LINE>
<LINE>Tokens, as if they suggested for him, It is a falsehood</LINE>
<LINE>She is in, which is with falsehoods to be combated.</LINE>
<LINE>This may bring her to eate, to sleepe, and reduce what's</LINE>
<LINE>Now out of square in her, into their former law, and</LINE>
<LINE>Regiment; I have seene it approved, how many times</LINE>
<LINE>I know not, but to make the number more, I have</LINE>
<LINE>Great hope in this. I will betweene the passages of</LINE>

<LINE>To large Confessors, and have hotly ask'd them</LINE>
<LINE>If they had Mothers, I had one, a woman,</LINE>

<LINE>In him seem'd torture: this Anatomie</LINE>
<LINE>Had by his yong faire pheare a Boy, and I</LINE>
<LINE>Beleev'd it was his, for she swore it was,</LINE>
<LINE>And who would not beleeve her? briefe I am</LINE>
<LINE>To those that prate and have done; no Companion</LINE>
<LINE>To those that boast and have not; a defyer</LINE>
<LINE>To those that would and cannot; a Rejoycer,</LINE>
<LINE>Yea him I doe not love, that tells close offices</LINE>
<LINE>The fowlest way, nor names concealements in</LINE>
<LINE>The boldest language, such a one I am,</LINE>
<LINE>And vow that lover never yet made sigh</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>[Exeunt Theseus, Hipolita, Perithous, &amp;c.]</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Emil.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Arcite is gently visagd; yet his eye</LINE>
<LINE>Is like an Engyn bent, or a sharpe weapon</LINE>
<LINE>In a soft sheath; mercy, and manly courage</LINE>
<LINE>Are bedfellowes in his visage: Palamon</LINE>
<LINE>Has a most menacing aspect, his brow</LINE>
<LINE>Is grav'd, and seemes to bury what it frownes on,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet sometime tis not so, but alters to</LINE>
<LINE>The quallity of his thoughts; long time his eye</LINE>
<LINE>Will dwell upon his object. Mellencholly</LINE>
<LINE>Becomes him nobly; So do's Arcites mirth,</LINE>
<LINE>But Palamons sadnes is a kinde of mirth,</LINE>
<LINE>So mingled, as if mirth did make him sad,</LINE>
<LINE>And sadnes, merry; those darker humours that</LINE>
<LINE>Sticke misbecomingly on others, on them</LINE>
<LINE>Live in faire dwelling.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>[Cornets. Trompets sound as to a charge.]</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Harke how yon spurs to spirit doe incite</LINE>
<LINE>The Princes to their proofe, Arcite may win me,</LINE>
<LINE>And yet may Palamon wound Arcite to</LINE>
<LINE>The spoyling of his figure. O what pitty</LINE>
<LINE>Enough for such a chance; if I were by</LINE>
<LINE>I might doe hurt, for they would glance their eies</LINE>
<LINE>Toward my Seat, and in that motion might</LINE>
<LINE>Omit a ward, or forfeit an offence</LINE>
<LINE>Which crav'd that very time: it is much better</LINE>
<LINE>Then minister to such harme, what is the chance?</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>[Another cry, and showt within, and Cornets.]</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>On the sinister side, the heart lyes; Palamon</LINE>
<LINE>Had the best boding chance: This burst of clamour</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Ser.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>They saide that Palamon had Arcites body</LINE>

<LINE>Th 'Assistants made a brave redemption, and</LINE>
<LINE>The two bold Tytlers, at this instant are</LINE>
<LINE>Hand to hand at it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Emil.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Were they metamorphisd</LINE>
<LINE>Both into one; oh why? there were no woman</LINE>
<LINE>Worth so composd a Man: their single share,</LINE>
<LINE>Their noblenes peculier to them, gives</LINE>
<LINE>The prejudice of disparity values shortnes</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>[Cornets. Cry within, Arcite, Arcite.]</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>Nay, now the sound is Arcite.</LINE>

<LINE>By the wind Instruments.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Emil.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Halfe sights saw</LINE>
<LINE>That Arcite was no babe: god's lyd, his richnes</LINE>
<LINE>And costlines of spirit look't through him, it could</LINE>
<LINE>No more be hid in him, then fire in flax,</LINE>
<LINE>Then humble banckes can goe to law with waters,</LINE>
<LINE>That drift windes, force to raging: I did thinke</LINE>
<LINE>Good Palamon would miscarry, yet I knew not</LINE>
<LINE>Why I did thinke so; Our reasons are not prophets</LINE>
<LINE>When oft our fancies are: They are comming off:</LINE>
<LINE>Alas poore Palamon.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>[Cornets.]</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Lo, where our Sister is in expectation,</LINE>

<LINE>Have given you this Knight, he is a good one</LINE>
<LINE>As ever strooke at head: Give me your hands;</LINE>
<LINE>Receive you her, you him, be plighted with</LINE>
<LINE>A love that growes, as you decay;</LINE>

<LINE>To buy you, I have lost what's deerest to me,</LINE>
<LINE>Save what is bought, and yet I purchase cheapely,</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Thes.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O loved Sister,</LINE>
<LINE>He speakes now of as brave a Knight as ere</LINE>
<LINE>Did spur a noble Steed: Surely the gods</LINE>
<LINE>Would have him die a Batchelour, least his race</LINE>
<LINE>Should shew i'th world too godlike: His behaviour</LINE>
<LINE>So charmd me, that me thought Alcides was</LINE>
<LINE>To him a sow of lead: if I could praise</LINE>
<LINE>Each part of him to'th all; I have spoke, your Arcite</LINE>
<LINE>Did not loose by't; For he that was thus good</LINE>
<LINE>Encountred yet his Better, I have heard</LINE>
<LINE>Two emulous Philomels, beate the eare o'th night</LINE>
<LINE>With their contentious throates, now one the higher,</LINE>
<LINE>Anon the other, then againe the first,</LINE>
<LINE>And by and by out breasted, that the sence</LINE>
<LINE>Could not be judge betweene 'em: So it far'd</LINE>
<LINE>Good space betweene these kinesmen; till heavens did</LINE>
<LINE>Make hardly one the winner: weare the Girlond</LINE>
<LINE>With joy that you have won: For the subdude,</LINE>
<LINE>Give them our present Iustice, since I know</LINE>
<LINE>Their lives but pinch 'em; Let it here be done:</LINE>
<LINE>The Sceane's not for our seeing, goe we hence,</LINE>
<LINE>Right joyfull, with some sorrow. Arme your prize,</LINE>
<LINE>I know you will not loose her: Hipolita</LINE>

<LINE>Mounted upon a Steed that Emily</LINE>

<LINE>Not a hayre worth of white, which some will say</LINE>
<LINE>Weakens his price, and many will not buy</LINE>
<LINE>His goodnesse with this note: Which superstition</LINE>
<LINE>Heere findes allowance: On this horse is Arcite</LINE>
<LINE>Trotting the stones of Athens, which the Calkins</LINE>
<LINE>Did rather tell, then trample; for the horse</LINE>
<LINE>Would make his length a mile, if't pleas'd his Rider</LINE>
<LINE>To put pride in him: as he thus went counting</LINE>
<LINE>The flinty pavement, dancing as t'wer to'th Musicke</LINE>

<LINE>Came Musickes origen) what envious Flint,</LINE>
<LINE>Cold as old Saturne, and like him possest</LINE>
<LINE>With fire malevolent, darted a Sparke</LINE>
<LINE>Or what feirce sulphur else, to this end made,</LINE>
<LINE>I comment not; the hot horse, hot as fire</LINE>
<LINE>Tooke Toy at this, and fell to what disorder</LINE>
<LINE>His power could give his will, bounds, comes on end,</LINE>
<LINE>Forgets schoole dooing, being therein traind,</LINE>
<LINE>And of kind mannadge, pig-like he whines</LINE>

<LINE>on end he stands</LINE>

<LINE>Even then fell off his head: and presently</LINE>
<LINE>Backeward the Iade comes ore, and his full poyze</LINE>
<LINE>Becomes the Riders loade: yet is he living,</LINE>
<LINE>But such a vessell tis, that floates but for</LINE>

<LINE>To have some speech with you: Loe he appeares.</LINE>
<LINE>The gods are mightie Arcite, if thy heart,</LINE>

<LINE>Even then proclaimd your fancie: He restord her</LINE>
<LINE>As your stolne Iewell, and desir'd your spirit</LINE>
<LINE>To send him hence forgiven; The gods my justice</LINE>
<LINE>Take from my hand, and they themselves become</LINE>
<LINE>The Executioners: Leade your Lady off;</LINE>
<LINE>And call your Lovers from the stage of death,</LINE>
<LINE>Whom I adopt my Frinds. A day or two</LINE>
<LINE>Let us looke sadly, and give grace unto</LINE>
<LINE>The Funerall of Arcite, in whose end</LINE>
<LINE>The visages of Bridegroomes weele put on</LINE>
<LINE>And smile with Palamon; for whom an houre,</LINE>
<LINE>But one houre since, I was as dearely sorry,</LINE>
<LINE>As glad of Arcite: and am now as glad,</LINE>
<LINE>As for him sorry. O you heavenly Charmers,</LINE>
<LINE>What things you make of us? For what we lacke</LINE>
<LINE>We laugh, for what we have, are sorry still,</LINE>
<LINE>Are children in some kind. Let us be thankefull</LINE>
