<line>To the Right Honorable Henrie Wriothesley,</line>
<line>Earle of Southampton, and Baron of Titchfield.</line>
<line>Right Honourable, I know not how I shall offend in dedicating my vnpolisht lines to your Lordship, nor how the worlde will censure mee for choosing so strong a proppe to support so weake a burden, onelye if your Honour seeme but pleased, I account my selfe highly praised, and vowe to take aduantage of all idle houres, till I haue honoured you with some grauer labour. But if the first heire of my inuention proue deformed, I shall be sorie it had so noble a god-father: and neuer after eare so barren a land, for feare it yeeld me still so bad a haruest, I leaue it to your Honourable suruey, and your Honor to your hearts content, which I wish may alwaies answere your owne wish, and the worlds hopefull expectation.</line>
<line>Your Honors in all dutie,</line>

<poembody>
<stanza>
<line>Even as the sun with purple-color&#8217;d face</line>
<line>Had ta&#8217;en his last leave of the weeping morn,</line>
<line>Rose-cheek&#8217;d Adonis hied him to the chase;</line>
<line>Hunting he lov&#8217;d, but love he laugh&#8217;d to scorn.</line>
<couplet>Sick-thoughted Venus makes amain unto him,</couplet>
<couplet>And like a bold-fac&#8217;d suitor gins to woo him.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>&#8220;Thrice fairer than myself,&#8221; thus she began,</line>
<line>&#8220;The field&#8217;s chief flower, sweet above compare,</line>
<line>Stain to all nymphs, more lovely than a man,</line>
<line>More white and red than doves or roses are,</line>
<couplet>Nature, that made thee with herself at strife,</couplet>
<couplet>Saith that the world hath ending with thy life.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Vouchsafe, thou wonder, to alight thy steed,</line>
<line>And rein his proud head to the saddle-bow;</line>
<line>If thou wilt deign this favor, for thy meed</line>
<line>A thousand honey secrets shalt thou know.</line>
<couplet>Here come and sit, where never serpent hisses,</couplet>
<couplet>And being set, I&#8217;ll smother thee with kisses;</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>And yet not cloy thy lips with loath&#8217;d saciety,</line>
<line>But rather famish them amid their plenty,</line>
<line>Making them red, and pale, with fresh variety&#8212;</line>
<line>Ten kisses short as one, one long as twenty.</line>
<couplet>A summer&#8217;s day will seem an hour but short,</couplet>
<couplet>Being wasted in such time-beguiling sport.&#8221;</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>With this she seizeth on his sweating palm,</line>
<line>The president of pith and livelihood,</line>
<line>And trembling in her passion, calls it balm,</line>
<line>Earth&#8217;s sovereign salve, to do a goddess good.</line>
<couplet>Being so enrag&#8217;d, desire doth lend her force</couplet>
<couplet>Courageously to pluck him from his horse.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Over one arm the lusty courser&#8217;s rein,</line>
<line>Under her other was the tender boy,</line>
<line>Who blush&#8217;d, and pouted in a dull disdain,</line>
<line>With leaden appetite, unapt to toy;</line>
<couplet>She red and hot as coals of glowing fire,</couplet>
<couplet>He red for shame, but frosty in desire.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>The studded bridle on a ragged bough</line>
<line>Nimbly she fastens (O how quick is love!);</line>
<line>The steed is stalled up, and even now</line>
<line>To tie the rider she begins to prove.</line>
<couplet>Backward she push&#8217;d him, as she would be thrust,</couplet>
<couplet>And govern&#8217;d him in strength, though not in lust.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>So soon was she along as he was down,</line>
<line>Each leaning on their elbows and their hips.</line>
<line>Now doth she stroke his cheek, now doth he frown,</line>
<line>And gins to chide, but soon she stops his lips,</line>
<couplet>And kissing speaks, with lustful language broken,</couplet>
<couplet>&#8220;If thou wilt chide, thy lips shall never open.&#8221;</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>He burns with bashful shame, she with her tears</line>
<line>Doth quench the maiden burning of his cheeks;</line>
<line>Then with her windy sighs and golden hairs</line>
<line>To fan and blow them dry again she seeks.</line>
<couplet>He saith she is immodest, blames her miss;</couplet>
<couplet>What follows more, she murders with a kiss.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Even as an empty eagle, sharp by fast,</line>
<line>Tires with her beak on feathers, flesh, and bone,</line>
<line>Shaking her wings, devouring all in haste,</line>
<line>Till either gorge be stuff&#8217;d, or prey be gone;</line>
<couplet>Even so she kiss&#8217;d his brow, his cheek, his chin,</couplet>
<couplet>And where she ends, she doth anew begin.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Forc&#8217;d to content, but never to obey,</line>
<line>Panting he lies, and breatheth in her face.</line>
<line>She feedeth on the steam, as on a prey,</line>
<line>And calls it heavenly moisture, air of grace,</line>
<couplet>Wishing her cheeks were gardens full of flowers,</couplet>
<couplet>So they were dew&#8217;d with such distilling showers.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Look how a bird lies tangled in a net,</line>
<line>So fast&#8217;ned in her arms Adonis lies;</line>
<line>Pure shame and aw&#8217;d resistance made him fret,</line>
<line>Which bred more beauty in his angry eyes.</line>
<couplet>Rain added to a river that is rank</couplet>
<couplet>Perforce will force it overflow the bank.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Still she entreats, and prettily entreats,</line>
<line>For to a pretty ear she tunes her tale.</line>
<line>Still is he sullen, still he low&#8217;rs and frets,</line>
<line>&#8217;Twixt crimson shame and anger ashy-pale.</line>
<couplet>Being red, she loves him best, and being white,</couplet>
<couplet>Her best is better&#8217;d with a more delight.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Look how he can, she cannot choose but love,</line>
<line>And by her fair immortal hand she swears</line>
<line>From his soft bosom never to remove</line>
<line>Till he take truce with her contending tears,</line>
<couplet>Which long have rain&#8217;d, making her cheeks all wet,</couplet>
<couplet>And one sweet kiss shall pay this comptless debt.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Upon this promise did he raise his chin,</line>
<line>Like a dive-dapper peering through a wave,</line>
<line>Who being look&#8217;d on, ducks as quickly in;</line>
<line>So offers he to give what she did crave,</line>
<couplet>But when her lips were ready for his pay,</couplet>
<couplet>He winks, and turns his lips another way.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Never did passenger in summer&#8217;s heat</line>
<line>More thirst for drink than she for this good turn.</line>
<line>Her help she sees, but help she cannot get,</line>
<line>She bathes in water, yet her fire must burn.</line>
<couplet>&#8220;O, pity,&#8221; gan she cry, &#8220;flint-hearted boy,</couplet>
<couplet>&#8217;Tis but a kiss I beg, why art thou coy?</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>I have been wooed, as I entreat thee now,</line>
<line>Even by the stern and direful god of war,</line>
<line>Whose sinowy neck in battle ne&#8217;er did bow,</line>
<line>Who conquers where he comes in every jar,</line>
<couplet>Yet hath he been my captive, and my slave,</couplet>
<couplet>And begg&#8217;d for that which thou unask&#8217;d shalt have.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Over my altars hath he hung his lance,</line>
<line>His batt&#8217;red shield, his uncontrolled crest,</line>
<line>And for my sake hath learn&#8217;d to sport and dance,</line>
<line>To toy, to wanton, dally, smile, and jest,</line>
<couplet>Scorning his churlish drum, and ensign red,</couplet>
<couplet>Making my arms his field, his tent my bed.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Thus he that overrul&#8217;d I overswayed,</line>
<line>Leading him prisoner in a red rose chain;</line>
<line>Strong-temper&#8217;d steel his stronger strength obeyed,</line>
<line>Yet was he servile to my coy disdain.</line>
<couplet>O, be not proud, nor brag not of thy might,</couplet>
<couplet>For mast&#8217;ring her that foil&#8217;d the god of fight.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Touch but my lips with those fair lips of thine&#8212;</line>
<line>Though mine be not so fair, yet are they red&#8212;</line>
<line>The kiss shall be thine own as well as mine.</line>
<line>What seest thou in the ground? Hold up thy head,</line>
<couplet>Look in mine eyeballs, there thy beauty lies;</couplet>
<couplet>Then why not lips on lips, since eyes in eyes?</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Art thou asham&#8217;d to kiss? Then wink again,</line>
<line>And I will wink, so shall the day seem night.</line>
<line>Love keeps his revels where there are but twain;</line>
<line>Be bold to play, our sport is not in sight;</line>
<couplet>These blue-vein&#8217;d violets whereon we lean</couplet>
<couplet>Never can blab, nor know not what we mean.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>The tender spring upon thy tempting lip</line>
<line>Shows thee unripe; yet mayst thou well be tasted.</line>
<line>Make use of time, let not advantage slip,</line>
<line>Beauty within itself should not be wasted.</line>
<couplet>Fair flowers that are not gath&#8217;red in their prime</couplet>
<couplet>Rot, and consume themselves in little time.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Were I hard-favor&#8217;d, foul, or wrinkled old,</line>
<line>Ill-nurtur&#8217;d, crooked, churlish, harsh in voice,</line>
<line>O&#8217;erworn, despised, rheumatic, and cold,</line>
<line>Thick-sighted, barren, lean, and lacking juice,</line>
<couplet>Then mightst thou pause, for then I were not for thee,</couplet>
<couplet>But having no defects, why dost abhor me?</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Thou canst not see one wrinkle in my brow,</line>
<line>Mine eyes are grey, and bright, and quick in turning;</line>
<line>My beauty as the spring doth yearly grow,</line>
<line>My flesh is soft and plump, my marrow burning,</line>
<couplet>My smooth moist hand, were it with thy hand felt,</couplet>
<couplet>Would in thy palm dissolve, or seem to melt.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Bid me discourse, I will enchant thine ear,</line>
<line>Or like a fairy, trip upon the green,</line>
<line>Or like a nymph, with long dishevelled hair,</line>
<line>Dance on the sands, and yet no footing seen.</line>
<couplet>Love is a spirit all compact of fire,</couplet>
<couplet>Not gross to sink, but light, and will aspire.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Witness this primrose bank whereon I lie,</line>
<line>These forceless flowers like sturdy trees support me;</line>
<line>Two strengthless doves will draw me through the sky,</line>
<line>From morn till night, even where I list to sport me.</line>
<couplet>Is love so light, sweet boy, and may it be</couplet>
<couplet>That thou should think it heavy unto thee?</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Is thine own heart to thine own face affected?</line>
<line>Can thy right hand seize love upon thy left?</line>
<line>Then woo thyself, be of thyself rejected;</line>
<line>Steal thine own freedom, and complain on theft.</line>
<couplet>Narcissus so himself himself forsook,</couplet>
<couplet>And died to kiss his shadow in the brook.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Torches are made to light, jewels to wear,</line>
<line>Dainties to taste, fresh beauty for the use,</line>
<line>Herbs for their smell, and sappy plants to bear:</line>
<line>Things growing to themselves are growth&#8217;s abuse.</line>
<couplet>Seeds spring from seeds, and beauty breedeth beauty;</couplet>
<couplet>Thou wast begot, to get it is thy duty.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Upon the earth&#8217;s increase why shouldst thou feed,</line>
<line>Unless the earth with thy increase be fed?</line>
<line>By law of nature thou art bound to breed,</line>
<line>That thine may live, when thou thyself art dead;</line>
<couplet>And so in spite of death thou dost survive,</couplet>
<couplet>In that thy likeness still is left alive.&#8221;</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>By this the love-sick queen began to sweat,</line>
<line>For where they lay the shadow had forsook them,</line>
<line>And Titan, tired in the midday heat,</line>
<line>With burning eye did hotly overlook them,</line>
<couplet>Wishing Adonis had his team to guide,</couplet>
<couplet>So he were like him, and by Venus&#8217; side.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>And now Adonis, with a lazy sprite,</line>
<line>And with a heavy, dark, disliking eye,</line>
<line>His low&#8217;ring brows o&#8217;erwhelming his fair sight,</line>
<line>Like misty vapors when they blot the sky,</line>
<couplet>Souring his cheeks, cries, &#8220;Fie, no more of love!</couplet>
<couplet>The sun doth burn my face, I must remove.&#8221;</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>&#8220;Ay me,&#8221; quoth Venus, &#8220;young, and so unkind,</line>
<line>What bare excuses mak&#8217;st thou to be gone!</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll sigh celestial breath, whose gentle wind</line>
<line>Shall cool the heat of this descending sun;</line>
<couplet>I&#8217;ll make a shadow for thee of my hairs;</couplet>
<couplet>If they burn too, I&#8217;ll quench them with my tears.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>The sun that shines from heaven shines but warm,</line>
<line>And lo I lie between that sun and thee;</line>
<line>The heat I have from thence doth little harm,</line>
<line>Thine eye darts forth the fire that burneth me,</line>
<couplet>And were I not immortal, life were done,</couplet>
<couplet>Between this heavenly and earthly sun.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Art thou obdurate, flinty, hard as steel?</line>
<line>Nay, more than flint, for stone at rain relenteth.</line>
<line>Art thou a woman&#8217;s son and canst not feel</line>
<line>What &#8217;tis to love, how want of love tormenteth?</line>
<couplet>O, had thy mother borne so hard a mind,</couplet>
<couplet>She had not brought forth thee, but died unkind.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>What am I that thou shouldst contemn me this?</line>
<line>Or what great danger dwells upon my suit?</line>
<line>What were thy lips the worse for one poor kiss?</line>
<line>Speak, fair, but speak fair words, or else be mute.</line>
<couplet>Give me one kiss, I&#8217;ll give it thee again,</couplet>
<couplet>And one for int&#8217;rest, if thou wilt have twain.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Fie, liveless picture, cold and senseless stone,</line>
<line>Well-painted idol, image dull and dead,</line>
<line>Statuë contenting but the eye alone,</line>
<line>Thing like a man, but of no woman bred!</line>
<couplet>Thou art no man, though of a man&#8217;s complexion,</couplet>
<couplet>For men will kiss even by their own direction.&#8221;</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>This said, impatience chokes her pleading tongue,</line>
<line>And swelling passion doth provoke a pause.</line>
<line>Red cheeks and fiery eyes blaze forth her wrong;</line>
<line>Being judge in love, she cannot right her cause.</line>
<couplet>And now she weeps, and now she fain would speak,</couplet>
<couplet>And now her sobs do her intendments break.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Sometime she shakes her head, and then his hand,</line>
<line>Now gazeth she on him, now on the ground;</line>
<line>Sometime her arms infold him like a band:</line>
<line>She would, he will not in her arms be bound;</line>
<couplet>And when from thence he struggles to be gone,</couplet>
<couplet>She locks her lily fingers one in one.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>&#8220;Fondling,&#8221; she saith, &#8220;since I have hemm&#8217;d thee here</line>
<line>Within the circuit of this ivory pale,</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll be a park, and thou shalt be my deer:</line>
<line>Feed where thou wilt, on mountain, or in dale;</line>
<couplet>Graze on my lips, and if those hills be dry,</couplet>
<couplet>Stray lower, where the pleasant fountains lie.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Within this limit is relief enough,</line>
<line>Sweet bottom grass and high delightful plain,</line>
<line>Round rising hillocks, brakes obscure and rough,</line>
<line>To shelter thee from tempest and from rain;</line>
<couplet>Then be my deer, since I am such a park,</couplet>
<couplet>No dog shall rouse thee, though a thousand bark.&#8221;</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>At this Adonis smiles as in disdain,</line>
<line>That in each cheek appears a pretty dimple;</line>
<line>Love made those hollows, if himself were slain,</line>
<line>He might be buried in a tomb so simple,</line>
<couplet>Foreknowing well, if there he came to lie,</couplet>
<couplet>Why, there Love liv&#8217;d, and there he could not die.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>These lovely caves, these round enchanting pits,</line>
<line>Open&#8217;d their mouths to swallow Venus&#8217; liking.</line>
<line>Being mad before, how doth she now for wits?</line>
<line>Struck dead at first, what needs a second striking?</line>
<couplet>Poor queen of love, in thine own law forlorn,</couplet>
<couplet>To love a cheek that smiles at thee in scorn!</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Now which way shall she turn? What shall she say?</line>
<line>Her words are done, her woes the more increasing;</line>
<line>The time is spent, her object will away,</line>
<line>And from her twining arms doth urge releasing.</line>
<couplet>&#8220;Pity,&#8221; she cries, &#8220;some favor, some remorse!&#8221;</couplet>
<couplet>Away he springs, and hasteth to his horse.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>But lo from forth a copse that neighbors by,</line>
<line>A breeding jennet, lusty, young, and proud,</line>
<line>Adonis&#8217; trampling courser doth espy;</line>
<line>And forth she rushes, snorts, and neighs aloud.</line>
<couplet>The strong-neck&#8217;d steed, being tied unto a tree,</couplet>
<couplet>Breaketh his rein, and to her straight goes he.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Imperiously he leaps, he neighs, he bounds,</line>
<line>And now his woven girths he breaks asunder;</line>
<line>The bearing earth with his hard hoof he wounds,</line>
<line>Whose hollow womb resounds like heaven&#8217;s thunder;</line>
<couplet>The iron bit he crusheth &#8217;tween his teeth,</couplet>
<couplet>Controlling what he was controlled with.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>His ears up-prick&#8217;d, his braided hanging mane</line>
<line>Upon his compass&#8217;d crest now stand on end,</line>
<line>His nostrils drink the air, and forth again</line>
<line>As from a furnace, vapors doth he send;</line>
<couplet>His eye, which scornfully glisters like fire,</couplet>
<couplet>Shows his hot courage and his high desire.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Sometime he trots, as if he told the steps,</line>
<line>With gentle majesty and modest pride;</line>
<line>Anon he rears upright, curvets, and leaps,</line>
<line>As who should say, &#8220;Lo thus my strength is tried;</line>
<couplet>And this I do to captivate the eye</couplet>
<couplet>Of the fair breeder that is standing by.&#8221;</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>What recketh he his rider&#8217;s angry stir,</line>
<line>His flattering &#8220;Holla,&#8221; or his &#8220;Stand, I say&#8221;?</line>
<line>What cares he now for curb, or pricking spur,</line>
<line>For rich caparisons, or trappings gay?</line>
<couplet>He sees his love, and nothing else he sees,</couplet>
<couplet>For nothing else with his proud sight agrees.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Look when a painter would surpass the life</line>
<line>In limning out a well-proportioned steed,</line>
<line>His art with nature&#8217;s workmanship at strife,</line>
<line>As if the dead the living should exceed;</line>
<couplet>So did this horse excel a common one,</couplet>
<couplet>In shape, in courage, color, pace, and bone.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Round-hoof&#8217;d, short-jointed, fetlocks shag and long,</line>
<line>Broad breast, full eye, small head, and nostril wide,</line>
<line>High crest, short ears, straight legs and passing strong,</line>
<line>Thin mane, thick tail, broad buttock, tender hide:</line>
<couplet>Look what a horse should have he did not lack,</couplet>
<couplet>Save a proud rider on so proud a back.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Sometime he scuds far off, and there he stares,</line>
<line>Anon he starts at stirring of a feather;</line>
<line>To bid the wind a base he now prepares,</line>
<line>And whe&#8217;er he run, or fly, they know not whether;</line>
<couplet>For through his mane and tail the high wind sings,</couplet>
<couplet>Fanning the hairs, who wave like feath&#8217;red wings.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>He looks upon his love, and neighs unto her,</line>
<line>She answers him, as if she knew his mind;</line>
<line>Being proud as females are, to see him woo her,</line>
<line>She puts on outward strangeness, seems unkind,</line>
<couplet>Spurns at his love, and scorns the heat he feels,</couplet>
<couplet>Beating his kind embracements with her heels.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Then like a melancholy malcontent,</line>
<line>He vails his tail that like a falling plume</line>
<line>Cool shadow to his melting buttock lent;</line>
<line>He stamps, and bites the poor flies in his fume.</line>
<couplet>His love, perceiving how he was enrag&#8217;d,</couplet>
<couplet>Grew kinder, and his fury was assuag&#8217;d.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>His testy master goeth about to take him,</line>
<line>When lo the unback&#8217;d breeder, full of fear,</line>
<line>Jealous of catching, swiftly doth forsake him,</line>
<line>With her the horse, and left Adonis there.</line>
<couplet>As they were mad unto the wood they hie them,</couplet>
<couplet>Outstripping crows that strive to overfly them.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>All swoll&#8217;n with chafing, down Adonis sits,</line>
<line>Banning his boist&#8217;rous and unruly beast;</line>
<line>And now the happy season once more fits</line>
<line>That love-sick Love by pleading may be blest;</line>
<couplet>For lovers say, the heart hath treble wrong</couplet>
<couplet>When it is barr&#8217;d the aidance of the tongue.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>An oven that is stopp&#8217;d, or river stay&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Burneth more hotly, swelleth with more rage;</line>
<line>So of concealed sorrow may be said,</line>
<line>Free vent of words love&#8217;s fire doth assuage,</line>
<couplet>But when the heart&#8217;s attorney once is mute,</couplet>
<couplet>The client breaks, as desperate in his suit.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>He sees her coming, and begins to glow,</line>
<line>Even as a dying coal revives with wind,</line>
<line>And with his bonnet hides his angry brow,</line>
<line>Looks on the dull earth with disturbed mind,</line>
<couplet>Taking no notice that she is so nigh,</couplet>
<couplet>For all askance he holds her in his eye.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>O what a sight it was wistly to view,</line>
<line>How she came stealing to the wayward boy,</line>
<line>To note the fighting conflict of her hue,</line>
<line>How white and red each other did destroy!</line>
<couplet>But now her cheek was pale, and by and by</couplet>
<couplet>It flash&#8217;d forth fire, as lightning from the sky.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Now was she just before him as he sat,</line>
<line>And like a lowly lover down she kneels;</line>
<line>With one fair hand she heaveth up his hat,</line>
<line>Her other tender hand his fair cheek feels:</line>
<couplet>His tend&#8217;rer cheek receives her soft hand&#8217;s print,</couplet>
<couplet>As apt as new-fall&#8217;n snow takes any dint.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>O what a war of looks was then between them!</line>
<line>Her eyes petitioners to his eyes suing,</line>
<line>His eyes saw her eyes as they had not seen them,</line>
<line>Her eyes wooed still, his eyes disdain&#8217;d the wooing;</line>
<couplet>And all this dumb play had his acts made plain</couplet>
<couplet>With tears which chorus-like her eyes did rain.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Full gently now she takes him by the hand,</line>
<line>A lily prison&#8217;d in a jail of snow,</line>
<line>Or ivory in an alablaster band,</line>
<line>So white a friend engirts so white a foe:</line>
<couplet>This beauteous combat, willful and unwilling,</couplet>
<couplet>Showed like two silver doves that sit a-billing.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Once more the engine of her thoughts began:</line>
<line>&#8220;O fairest mover on this mortal round,</line>
<line>Would thou wert as I am, and I a man,</line>
<line>My heart all whole as thine, thy heart my wound!</line>
<couplet>For one sweet look thy help I would assure thee,</couplet>
<couplet>Though nothing but my body&#8217;s bane would cure thee.&#8221;</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>&#8220;Give me my hand,&#8221; saith he, &#8220;why dost thou feel it?&#8221;</line>
<line>&#8220;Give me my heart,&#8221; saith she, &#8220;and thou shalt have it.</line>
<line>O, give it me, lest thy hard heart do steel it,</line>
<line>And being steel&#8217;d, soft sighs can never grave it.</line>
<couplet>Then love&#8217;s deep groans I never shall regard,</couplet>
<couplet>Because Adonis&#8217; heart hath made mine hard.&#8221;</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>&#8220;For shame,&#8221; he cries, &#8220;let go, and let me go,</line>
<line>My day&#8217;s delight is past, my horse is gone,</line>
<line>And &#8217;tis your fault I am bereft him so.</line>
<line>I pray you hence, and leave me here alone,</line>
<couplet>For all my mind, my thought, my busy care,</couplet>
<couplet>Is how to get my palfrey from the mare.&#8221;</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Thus she replies: &#8220;Thy palfrey, as he should,</line>
<line>Welcomes the warm approach of sweet desire;</line>
<line>Affection is a coal that must be cool&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Else suffer&#8217;d it will set the heart on fire.</line>
<couplet>The sea hath bounds, but deep desire hath none,</couplet>
<couplet>Therefore no marvel though thy horse be gone.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>How like a jade he stood, tied to the tree,</line>
<line>Servilely master&#8217;d with a leathern rein!</line>
<line>But when he saw his love, his youth&#8217;s fair fee,</line>
<line>He held such petty bondage in disdain,</line>
<couplet>Throwing the base thong from his bending crest,</couplet>
<couplet>Enfranchising his mouth, his back, his breast.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Who sees his true-love in her naked bed,</line>
<line>Teaching the sheets a whiter hue than white,</line>
<line>But when his glutton eye so full hath fed,</line>
<line>His other agents aim at like delight?</line>
<couplet>Who is so faint that dares not be so bold</couplet>
<couplet>To touch the fire, the weather being cold?</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Let me excuse thy courser, gentle boy,</line>
<line>And learn of him, I heartily beseech thee,</line>
<line>To take advantage on presented joy;</line>
<line>Though I were dumb, yet his proceedings teach thee.</line>
<couplet>O, learn to love, the lesson is but plain,</couplet>
<couplet>And once made perfect, never lost again.&#8221;</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>&#8220;I know not love,&#8221; quoth he, &#8220;nor will not know it,</line>
<line>Unless it be a boar, and then I chase it;</line>
<line>&#8217;Tis much to borrow, and I will not owe it;</line>
<line>My love to love is love but to disgrace it,</line>
<couplet>For I have heard it is a life in death,</couplet>
<couplet>That laughs and weeps, and all but with a breath.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Who wears a garment shapeless and unfinish&#8217;d?</line>
<line>Who plucks the bud before one leaf put forth?</line>
<line>If springing things be any jot diminish&#8217;d,</line>
<line>They wither in their prime, prove nothing worth;</line>
<couplet>The colt that&#8217;s back&#8217;d and burden&#8217;d being young,</couplet>
<couplet>Loseth his pride, and never waxeth strong.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>You hurt my hand with wringing, let us part,</line>
<line>And leave this idle theme, this bootless chat;</line>
<line>Remove your siege from my unyielding heart,</line>
<line>To love&#8217;s alarms it will not ope the gate;</line>
<couplet>Dismiss your vows, your feigned tears, your flatt&#8217;ry,</couplet>
<couplet>For where a heart is hard they make no batt&#8217;ry.&#8221;</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>&#8220;What, canst thou talk?&#8221; quoth she, &#8220;hast thou a tongue?</line>
<line>O would thou hadst not, or I had no hearing!</line>
<line>Thy mermaid&#8217;s voice hath done me double wrong;</line>
<line>I had my load before, now press&#8217;d with bearing:</line>
<couplet>Melodious discord, heavenly tune harsh sounding,</couplet>
<couplet>Ears&#8217; deep sweet music, and heart&#8217;s deep sore wounding.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Had I no eyes but ears, my ears would love</line>
<line>That inward beauty and invisible,</line>
<line>Or were I deaf, thy outward parts would move</line>
<line>Each part in me that were but sensible;</line>
<couplet>Though neither eyes nor ears to hear nor see,</couplet>
<couplet>Yet should I be in love by touching thee.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Say that the sense of feeling were bereft me,</line>
<line>And that I could not see, nor hear, nor touch,</line>
<line>And nothing but the very smell were left me,</line>
<line>Yet would my love to thee be still as much,</line>
<couplet>For from the stillitory of thy face excelling</couplet>
<couplet>Comes breath perfum&#8217;d, that breedeth love by smelling.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>But O, what banquet wert thou to the taste,</line>
<line>Being nurse and feeder of the other four!</line>
<line>Would they not wish the feast might ever last,</line>
<line>And bid Suspicion double-lock the door,</line>
<couplet>Lest Jealousy, that sour unwelcome guest,</couplet>
<couplet>Should by his stealing in disturb the feast?&#8221;</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Once more the ruby-color&#8217;d portal open&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Which to his speech did honey passage yield,</line>
<line>Like a red morn, that ever yet betoken&#8217;d</line>
<line>Wrack to the seaman, tempest to the field,</line>
<couplet>Sorrow to shepherds, woe unto the birds,</couplet>
<couplet>Gusts and foul flaws to herdmen and to herds.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>This ill presage advisedly she marketh:</line>

<line>Or as the wolf doth grin before he barketh,</line>
<line>Or as the berry breaks before it staineth,</line>
<couplet>Or like the deadly bullet of a gun,</couplet>
<couplet>His meaning struck her ere his words begun.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>And at his look she flatly falleth down,</line>
<line>For looks kill love, and love by looks reviveth:</line>
<line>A smile recures the wounding of a frown.</line>
<line>But blessed bankrout that by love so thriveth!</line>
<couplet>The silly boy, believing she is dead,</couplet>
<couplet>Claps her pale cheek, till clapping makes it red;</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>And all amaz&#8217;d, brake off his late intent,</line>
<line>For sharply he did think to reprehend her,</line>
<line>Which cunning Love did wittily prevent:</line>
<line>Fair fall the wit that can so well defend her!</line>
<couplet>For on the grass she lies as she were slain,</couplet>
<couplet>Till his breath breatheth life in her again.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>He wrings her nose, he strikes her on the cheeks,</line>
<line>He bends her fingers, holds her pulses hard,</line>
<line>He chafes her lips, a thousand ways he seeks</line>
<line>To mend the hurt that his unkindness marr&#8217;d,</line>
<couplet>He kisses her, and she by her good will</couplet>
<couplet>Will never rise, so he will kiss her still.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>The night of sorrow now is turn&#8217;d to day:</line>
<line>Her two blue windows faintly she upheaveth,</line>
<line>Like the fair sun, when in his fresh array</line>
<line>He cheers the morn, and all the earth relieveth;</line>
<couplet>And as the bright sun glorifies the sky,</couplet>
<couplet>So is her face illumin&#8217;d with her eye,</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Whose beams upon his hairless face are fix&#8217;d,</line>

<couplet>But hers, which through the crystal tears gave light,</couplet>
<couplet>Shone like the moon in water seen by night.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>&#8220;O, where am I?&#8221; quoth she, &#8220;in earth or heaven,</line>
<line>Or in the ocean drench&#8217;d, or in the fire?</line>
<line>What hour is this? Or morn or weary even?</line>
<line>Do I delight to die, or life desire?</line>
<couplet>But now I liv&#8217;d, and life was death&#8217;s annoy,</couplet>
<couplet>But now I died, and death was lively joy.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>O, thou didst kill me, kill me once again.</line>
<line>Thy eyes&#8217; shrowd tutor, that hard heart of thine,</line>
<line>Hath taught them scornful tricks, and such disdain</line>
<line>That they have murd&#8217;red this poor heart of mine,</line>
<couplet>And these mine eyes, true leaders to their queen,</couplet>
<couplet>But for thy piteous lips no more had seen.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Long may they kiss each other for this cure!</line>
<line>O, never let their crimson liveries wear!</line>
<line>And as they last, their verdour still endure,</line>
<line>To drive infection from the dangerous year!</line>
<couplet>That the star-gazers, having writ on death,</couplet>
<couplet>May say, the plague is banish&#8217;d by thy breath.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Pure lips, sweet seals in my soft lips imprinted,</line>
<line>What bargains may I make, still to be sealing?</line>
<line>To sell myself I can be well contented,</line>
<line>So thou wilt buy, and pay, and use good dealing,</line>
<couplet>Which purchase if thou make, for fear of slips,</couplet>
<couplet>Set thy seal manual on my wax-red lips.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>A thousand kisses buys my heart from me,</line>
<line>And pay them at thy leisure, one by one.</line>
<line>What is ten hundred touches unto thee?</line>

<couplet>Say for non-payment that the debt should double,</couplet>
<couplet>Is twenty hundred kisses such a trouble?&#8221;</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>&#8220;Fair queen,&#8221; quoth he, &#8220;if any love you owe me,</line>
<line>Measure my strangeness with my unripe years;</line>
<line>Before I know myself, seek not to know me,</line>
<line>No fisher but the ungrown fry forbears;</line>

<stanza>
<line>Now let me say &#8216;Good night,&#8217; and so say you;</line>

<couplet>Her arms do lend his neck a sweet embrace;</couplet>
<couplet>Incorporate then they seem, face grows to face;</couplet>

<line>Till breathless he disjoin&#8217;d, and backward drew</line>

<couplet>He with her plenty press&#8217;d, she faint with dearth,</couplet>

</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Now quick desire hath caught the yielding prey,</line>

<couplet>Whose vultur thought doth pitch the price so high</couplet>
<couplet>That she will draw his lips&#8217; rich treasure dry.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>And having felt the sweetness of the spoil,</line>
<line>With blindfold fury she begins to forage;</line>
<line>Her face doth reek and smoke, her blood doth boil,</line>
<line>And careless lust stirs up a desperate courage,</line>
<couplet>Planting oblivion, beating reason back,</couplet>
<couplet>Forgetting shame&#8217;s pure blush and honor&#8217;s wrack.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Hot, faint, and weary, with her hard embracing,</line>
<line>Like a wild bird being tam&#8217;d with too much handling,</line>
<line>Or as the fleet-foot roe that&#8217;s tir&#8217;d with chasing,</line>
<line>Or like the froward infant still&#8217;d with dandling,</line>

<line>What wax so frozen but dissolves with temp&#8217;ring,</line>

<line>Chiefly in love, whose leave exceeds commission;</line>
<couplet>Affection faints not like a pale-fac&#8217;d coward,</couplet>

</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>When he did frown, O had she then gave over,</line>

<stanza>
<line>&#8220;Sweet boy,&#8221; she says, &#8220;this night I&#8217;ll waste in sorrow,</line>

<line>Tell me, Love&#8217;s master, shall we meet tomorrow?</line>

<stanza>
<line>Now is she in the very lists of love,</line>
<line>Her champion mounted for the hot encounter;</line>

<stanza>
<line>Even so poor birds, deceiv&#8217;d with painted grapes,</line>

<couplet>The warm effects which she in him finds missing</couplet>

<line>But all in vain, good queen, it will not be;</line>

<line>&#8220;Thou hadst been gone,&#8221; quoth she, &#8220;sweet boy, ere this,</line>

<line>O, be advis&#8217;d, thou know&#8217;st not what it is</line>
<line>With javeling&#8217;s point a churlish swine to gore,</line>
<couplet>Whose tushes never sheath&#8217;d he whetteth still,</couplet>
<couplet>Like to a mortal butcher bent to kill.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>On his bow-back he hath a battle set</line>
<line>Of bristly pikes that ever threat his foes,</line>

<couplet>Being mov&#8217;d, he strikes, what e&#8217;er is in his way,</couplet>

</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>His brawny sides, with hairy bristles armed,</line>

<line>His short thick neck cannot be easily harmed;</line>
<line>Being ireful, on the lion he will venter.</line>
<couplet>The thorny brambles and embracing bushes,</couplet>
<couplet>As fearful of him, part, through whom he rushes.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Alas, he nought esteems that face of thine,</line>
<line>To which Love&#8217;s eyes pays tributary gazes,</line>
<line>Nor thy soft hands, sweet lips, and crystal eyne,</line>
<line>Whose full perfection all the world amazes,</line>
<couplet>But having thee at vantage (wondrous dread!)</couplet>
<couplet>Would root these beauties as he roots the mead.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>O, let him keep his loathsome cabin still!</line>
<line>Beauty hath nought to do with such foul fiends.</line>
<line>Come not within his danger by thy will,</line>

<couplet>When thou didst name the boar, not to dissemble,</couplet>
<couplet>I fear&#8217;d thy fortune, and my joints did tremble.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Didst thou not mark my face? Was it not white?</line>

<line>Grew I not faint, and fell I not downright?</line>
<line>Within my bosom, whereon thou dost lie,</line>
<couplet>My boding heart pants, beats, and takes no rest,</couplet>
<couplet>But like an earthquake, shakes thee on my breast.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>For where Love reigns, disturbing Jealousy</line>
<line>Doth call himself Affection&#8217;s sentinel,</line>
<line>Gives false alarms, suggesteth mutiny,</line>
<line>And in a peaceful hour doth cry, &#8220;Kill, kill!&#8221;</line>
<couplet>Distemp&#8217;ring gentle Love in his desire,</couplet>
<couplet>As air and water do abate the fire.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>This sour informer, this bate-breeding spy,</line>
<line>This canker that eats up Love&#8217;s tender spring,</line>
<line>This carry-tale, dissentious Jealousy,</line>
<line>That sometime true news, sometime false doth bring,</line>
<couplet>Knocks at my heart, and whispers in mine ear,</couplet>
<couplet>That if I love thee, I thy death should fear;</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>And more than so, presenteth to mine eye</line>
<line>The picture of an angry chafing boar,</line>
<line>Under whose sharp fangs, on his back doth lie</line>
<line>An image like thyself, all stain&#8217;d with gore,</line>
<couplet>Whose blood upon the fresh flowers being shed,</couplet>
<couplet>Doth make them droop with grief and hang the head.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>What should I do, seeing thee so indeed,</line>
<line>That tremble at th&#8217; imagination?</line>
<line>The thought of it doth make my faint heart bleed,</line>
<line>And fear doth teach it divination:</line>
<couplet>I prophesy thy death, my living sorrow,</couplet>
<couplet>If thou encounter with the boar tomorrow.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>But if thou needs wilt hunt, be rul&#8217;d by me,</line>
<line>Uncouple at the timorous flying hare,</line>
<line>Or at the fox which lives by subtilty,</line>
<line>Or at the roe which no encounter dare;</line>
<couplet>Pursue these fearful creatures o&#8217;er the downs,</couplet>
<couplet>And on thy well-breath&#8217;d horse keep with thy hounds.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>And when thou hast on foot the purblind hare,</line>
<line>Mark the poor wretch, to overshut his troubles,</line>
<line>How he outruns the wind, and with what care</line>
<line>He cranks and crosses with a thousand doubles:</line>
<couplet>The many musits through the which he goes</couplet>
<couplet>Are like a labyrinth to amaze his foes.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Sometime he runs among a flock of sheep,</line>
<line>To make the cunning hounds mistake their smell,</line>
<line>And sometime where earth-delving conies keep,</line>
<line>To stop the loud pursuers in their yell,</line>
<couplet>And sometime sorteth with a herd of deer:</couplet>
<couplet>Danger deviseth shifts, wit waits on fear.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>For there his smell with others being mingled,</line>
<line>The hot scent-snuffing hounds are driven to doubt,</line>
<line>Ceasing their clamorous cry till they have singled</line>
<line>With much ado the cold fault cleanly out;</line>
<couplet>Then do they spend their mouths: echo replies,</couplet>
<couplet>As if another chase were in the skies.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>By this, poor Wat, far off upon a hill,</line>
<line>Stands on his hinder-legs with list&#8217;ning ear,</line>
<line>To hearken if his foes pursue him still.</line>
<line>Anon their loud alarums he doth hear,</line>
<couplet>And now his grief may be compared well</couplet>
<couplet>To one sore sick that hears the passing bell.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Then shalt thou see the dew-bedabbled wretch</line>
<line>Turn, and return, indenting with the way;</line>
<line>Each envious brier his weary legs do scratch,</line>
<line>Each shadow makes him stop, each murmur stay,</line>
<couplet>For misery is trodden on by many,</couplet>
<couplet>And being low, never reliev&#8217;d by any.</couplet>

<stanza>
<line>Lie quietly, and hear a little more,</line>
<line>Nay, do not struggle, for thou shalt not rise.</line>
<line>To make thee hate the hunting of the boar,</line>
<line>Unlike myself thou hear&#8217;st me moralize,</line>
<couplet>Applying this to that, and so to so,</couplet>
<couplet>For love can comment upon every woe.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Where did I leave?&#8221; &#8220;No matter where,&#8221; quoth he,</line>
<line>&#8220;Leave me, and then the story aptly ends;</line>
<line>The night is spent.&#8221; &#8220;Why, what of that?&#8221; quoth she.</line>
<line>&#8220;I am,&#8221; quoth he, &#8220;expected of my friends,</line>
<couplet>And now &#8217;tis dark, and going I shall fall.&#8221;</couplet>
<couplet>&#8220;In night,&#8221; quoth she, &#8220;desire sees best of all.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>But if thou fall, O then imagine this,</line>
<line>The earth, in love with thee, thy footing trips,</line>
<line>And all is but to rob thee of a kiss.</line>
<line>Rich preys make true men thieves; so do thy lips</line>
<couplet>Make modest Dian cloudy and forlorn,</couplet>
<couplet>Lest she should steal a kiss and die forsworn.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Now of this dark night I perceive the reason:</line>
<line>Cynthia for shame obscures her silver shine,</line>
<line>Till forging Nature be condemn&#8217;d of treason,</line>
<line>For stealing moulds from heaven that were divine,</line>
<couplet>Wherein she fram&#8217;d thee, in high heaven&#8217;s despite,</couplet>
<couplet>To shame the sun by day, and her by night.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>And therefore hath she brib&#8217;d the Destinies</line>
<line>To cross the curious workmanship of Nature,</line>
<line>To mingle beauty with infirmities,</line>
<line>And pure perfection with impure defeature,</line>
<couplet>Making it subject to the tyranny</couplet>
<couplet>Of mad mischances and much misery:</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>As burning fevers, agues pale and faint,</line>
<line>Life-poisoning pestilence, and frenzies wood,</line>
<line>The marrow-eating sickness, whose attaint</line>
<line>Disorder breeds by heating of the blood;</line>
<couplet>Surfeits, impostumes, grief, and damn&#8217;d despair</couplet>
<couplet>Swear Nature&#8217;s death for framing thee so fair.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>And not the least of all these maladies</line>
<line>But in one minute&#8217;s fight brings beauty under;</line>
<line>Both favor, savor, hue, and qualities,</line>
<line>Whereat th&#8217; impartial gazer late did wonder,</line>
<couplet>Are on the sudden wasted, thaw&#8217;d, and done,</couplet>
<couplet>As mountain snow melts with the midday sun.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Therefore despite of fruitless chastity,</line>
<line>Love-lacking vestals, and self-loving nuns,</line>
<line>That on the earth would breed a scarcity</line>
<line>And barren dearth of daughters and of sons,</line>
<couplet>Be prodigal: the lamp that burns by night</couplet>
<couplet>Dries up his oil to lend the world his light.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>What is thy body but a swallowing grave,</line>
<line>Seeming to bury that posterity</line>
<line>Which by the rights of time thou needs must have,</line>
<line>If thou destroy them not in dark obscurity?</line>
<couplet>If so, the world will hold thee in disdain,</couplet>
<couplet>Sith in thy pride so fair a hope is slain.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>So in thyself thyself art made away,</line>
<line>A mischief worse than civil home-bred strife,</line>
<line>Or theirs whose desperate hands themselves do slay,</line>
<line>Or butcher sire that reaves his son of life.</line>
<couplet>Foul cank&#8217;ring rust the hidden treasure frets,</couplet>
<couplet>But gold that&#8217;s put to use more gold begets.&#8221;</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>&#8220;Nay then,&#8221; quoth Adon, &#8220;you will fall again</line>
<line>Into your idle over-handled theme.</line>
<line>The kiss I gave you is bestow&#8217;d in vain,</line>
<line>And all in vain you strive against the stream,</line>
<couplet>For by this black-fac&#8217;d night, desire&#8217;s foul nurse,</couplet>
<couplet>Your treatise makes me like you worse and worse.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>If love have lent you twenty thousand tongues,</line>
<line>And every tongue more moving than your own,</line>
<line>Bewitching like the wanton mermaids&#8217; songs,</line>
<line>Yet from mine ear the tempting tune is blown;</line>
<couplet>For know my heart stands armed in mine ear,</couplet>
<couplet>And will not let a false sound enter there,</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Lest the deceiving harmony should run</line>
<line>Into the quiet closure of my breast,</line>
<line>And then my little heart were quite undone,</line>
<line>In his bedchamber to be barr&#8217;d of rest.</line>
<couplet>No, lady, no, my heart longs not to groan,</couplet>
<couplet>But soundly sleeps, while now it sleeps alone.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>What have you urg&#8217;d that I cannot reprove?</line>
<line>The path is smooth that leadeth on to danger.</line>
<line>I hate not love, but your device in love,</line>
<line>That lends embracements unto every stranger.</line>
<couplet>You do it for increase: O strange excuse!</couplet>
<couplet>When reason is the bawd to lust&#8217;s abuse.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Call it not love, for Love to heaven is fled,</line>
<line>Since sweating Lust on earth usurp&#8217;d his name,</line>
<line>Under whose simple semblance he hath fed</line>
<line>Upon fresh beauty, blotting it with blame;</line>
<couplet>Which the hot tyrant stains, and soon bereaves,</couplet>
<couplet>As caterpillars do the tender leaves.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Love comforteth like sunshine after rain,</line>
<line>But Lust&#8217;s effect is tempest after sun;</line>
<line>Love&#8217;s gentle spring doth always fresh remain,</line>
<line>Lust&#8217;s winter comes ere summer half be done;</line>
<couplet>Love surfeits not, Lust like a glutton dies;</couplet>
<couplet>Love is all truth, Lust full of forged lies.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>More I could tell, but more I dare not say,</line>
<line>The text is old, the orator too green,</line>
<line>Therefore in sadness, now I will away;</line>
<line>My face is full of shame, my heart of teen,</line>
<couplet>Mine ears, that to your wanton talk attended,</couplet>
<couplet>Do burn themselves for having so offended.&#8221;</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>With this he breaketh from the sweet embrace</line>
<line>Of those fair arms which bound him to her breast,</line>
<line>And homeward through the dark laund runs apace,</line>
<line>Leaves Love upon her back, deeply distress&#8217;d.</line>
<couplet>Look how a bright star shooteth from the sky,</couplet>
<couplet>So glides he in the night from Venus&#8217; eye,</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Which after him she darts, as one on shore</line>
<line>Gazing upon a late embarked friend,</line>
<line>Till the wild waves will have him seen no more,</line>
<line>Whose ridges with the meeting clouds contend;</line>
<couplet>So did the merciless and pitchy night</couplet>
<couplet>Fold in the object that did feed her sight.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Whereat amaz&#8217;d as one that unaware</line>
<line>Hath dropp&#8217;d a precious jewel in the flood,</line>
<line>Or stonish&#8217;d as night-wand&#8217;rers often are,</line>
<line>Their light blown out in some mistrustful wood,</line>
<couplet>Even so confounded in the dark she lay,</couplet>
<couplet>Having lost the fair discovery of her way.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>And now she beats her heart, whereat it groans,</line>
<line>That all the neighbor caves, as seeming troubled,</line>
<line>Make verbal repetition of her moans;</line>
<line>Passion on passion deeply is redoubled:</line>
<couplet>&#8220;Ay me!&#8221; she cries, and twenty times, &#8220;Woe, woe!&#8221;</couplet>
<couplet>And twenty echoes twenty times cry so.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>She marking them begins a wailing note,</line>
<line>And sings extemporally a woeful ditty,</line>
<line>How love makes young men thrall, and old men dote,</line>
<line>How love is wise in folly, foolish witty.</line>
<couplet>Her heavy anthem still concludes in woe,</couplet>
<couplet>And still the choir of echoes answer so.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Her song was tedious, and outwore the night,</line>
<line>For lovers&#8217; hours are long, though seeming short;</line>
<line>If pleas&#8217;d themselves, others they think delight</line>
<line>In such-like circumstance, with such-like sport.</line>
<couplet>Their copious stories, oftentimes begun,</couplet>
<couplet>End without audience, and are never done.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>For who hath she to spend the night withal,</line>
<line>But idle sounds resembling parasits,</line>
<line>Like shrill-tongu&#8217;d tapsters answering every call,</line>
<line>Soothing the humor of fantastic wits?</line>
<couplet>She says, &#8220;&#8217;Tis so,&#8221; they answer all, &#8220;&#8217;Tis so,&#8221;</couplet>
<couplet>And would say after her, if she said &#8220;No.&#8221;</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Lo here the gentle lark, weary of rest,</line>
<line>From his moist cabinet mounts up on high,</line>
<line>And wakes the morning, from whose silver breast</line>
<line>The sun ariseth in his majesty,</line>
<couplet>Who doth the world so gloriously behold</couplet>
<couplet>That cedar tops and hills seem burnish&#8217;d gold.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Venus salutes him with this fair good morrow:</line>
<line>&#8220;O thou clear god, and patron of all light,</line>
<line>From whom each lamp and shining star doth borrow</line>
<line>The beauteous influence that makes him bright,</line>
<couplet>There lives a son that suck&#8217;d an earthly mother,</couplet>
<couplet>May lend thee light, as thou dost lend to other.&#8221;</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>This said, she hasteth to a myrtle grove,</line>
<line>Musing the morning is so much o&#8217;erworn,</line>
<line>And yet she hears no tidings of her love.</line>
<line>She hearkens for his hounds and for his horn;</line>
<couplet>Anon she hears them chaunt it lustily,</couplet>
<couplet>And all in haste she coasteth to the cry.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>And as she runs, the bushes in the way,</line>
<line>Some catch her by the neck, some kiss her face,</line>
<line>Some twin&#8217;d about her thigh to make her stay.</line>
<line>She wildly breaketh from their strict embrace,</line>
<couplet>Like a milch doe, whose swelling dugs do ache,</couplet>
<couplet>Hasting to feed her fawn hid in some brake.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>By this she hears the hounds are at a bay,</line>
<line>Whereat she starts like one that spies an adder</line>
<line>Wreath&#8217;d up in fatal folds just in his way,</line>
<line>The fear whereof doth make him shake and shudder;</line>
<couplet>Even so the timorous yelping of the hounds</couplet>
<couplet>Appalls her senses, and her spirit confounds.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>For now she knows it is no gentle chase,</line>
<line>But the blunt boar, rough bear, or lion proud,</line>
<line>Because the cry remaineth in one place,</line>
<line>Where fearfully the dogs exclaim aloud;</line>
<couplet>Finding their enemy to be so curst,</couplet>
<couplet>They all strain court&#8217;sy who shall cope him first.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>This dismal cry rings sadly in her ear,</line>
<line>Through which it enters to surprise her heart,</line>
<line>Who overcome by doubt, and bloodless fear,</line>
<line>With cold-pale weakness numbs each feeling part:</line>
<couplet>Like soldiers when their captain once doth yield,</couplet>
<couplet>They basely fly, and dare not stay the field.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Thus stands she in a trembling ecstasy,</line>
<line>Till cheering up her senses all dismay&#8217;d,</line>
<line>She tells them &#8217;tis a causeless fantasy,</line>
<line>And childish error that they are afraid;</line>
<couplet>Bids them leave quaking, bids them fear no more&#8212;</couplet>
<couplet>And with that word, she spied the hunted boar,</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Whose frothy mouth bepainted all with red,</line>
<line>Like milk and blood being mingled both together,</line>
<line>A second fear through all her sinews spread,</line>
<line>Which madly hurries her she knows not whither;</line>
<couplet>This way she runs, and now she will no further,</couplet>
<couplet>But back retires to rate the boar for murder.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>A thousand spleens bear her a thousand ways,</line>
<line>She treads the path that she untreads again;</line>
<line>Her more than haste is mated with delays,</line>
<line>Like the proceedings of a drunken brain,</line>
<couplet>Full of respects, yet nought at all respecting,</couplet>
<couplet>In hand with all things, nought at all effecting.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Here kennell&#8217;d in a brake she finds a hound,</line>
<line>And asks the weary caitiff for his master,</line>
<line>And there another licking of his wound,</line>
<line>&#8217;Gainst venom&#8217;d sores the only sovereign plaster,</line>
<couplet>And here she meets another sadly scowling,</couplet>
<couplet>To whom she speaks, and he replies with howling.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>When he hath ceas&#8217;d his ill-resounding noise,</line>
<line>Another flap-mouth&#8217;d mourner, black and grim,</line>
<line>Against the welkin volleys out his voice;</line>
<line>Another, and another, answer him,</line>
<couplet>Clapping their proud tails to the ground below,</couplet>
<couplet>Shaking their scratch&#8217;d ears, bleeding as they go.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Look how the world&#8217;s poor people are amazed</line>
<line>At apparitions, signs, and prodigies,</line>
<line>Whereon with fearful eyes they long have gazed,</line>
<line>Infusing them with dreadful prophecies;</line>
<couplet>So she at these sad signs draws up her breath,</couplet>
<couplet>And sighing it again, exclaims on Death.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>&#8220;Hard-favor&#8217;d tyrant, ugly, meagre, lean,</line>
<line>Hateful divorce of love&#8221;&#8212;thus chides she Death&#8212;</line>
<line>&#8220;Grim-grinning ghost, earth&#8217;s worm, what dost thou mean</line>
<line>To stifle beauty, and to steal his breath?</line>
<couplet>Who when he liv&#8217;d, his breath and beauty set</couplet>
<couplet>Gloss on the rose, smell to the violet.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>If he be dead&#8212;O no, it cannot be,</line>
<line>Seeing his beauty, thou shouldst strike at it:</line>
<line>O yes, it may, thou hast no eyes to see,</line>
<line>But hatefully at randon dost thou hit.</line>
<couplet>Thy mark is feeble age, but thy false dart</couplet>
<couplet>Mistakes that aim, and cleaves an infant&#8217;s heart.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Hadst thou but bid beware, then he had spoke,</line>
<line>And hearing him, thy power had lost his power.</line>
<line>The Destinies will curse thee for this stroke:</line>
<line>They bid thee crop a weed, thou pluck&#8217;st a flower.</line>
<couplet>Love&#8217;s golden arrow at him should have fled,</couplet>
<couplet>And not Death&#8217;s ebon dart to strike him dead.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Dost thou drink tears, that thou provok&#8217;st such weeping?</line>
<line>What may a heavy groan advantage thee?</line>
<line>Why hast thou cast into eternal sleeping</line>
<line>Those eyes that taught all other eyes to see?</line>
<couplet>Now Nature cares not for thy mortal vigor,</couplet>
<couplet>Since her best work is ruin&#8217;d with thy rigor.&#8221;</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Here overcome, as one full of despair,</line>
<line>She vail&#8217;d her eyelids, who like sluices stopp&#8217;d</line>
<line>The crystal tide that from her two cheeks fair</line>
<line>In the sweet channel of her bosom dropp&#8217;d;</line>
<couplet>But through the flood-gates breaks the silver rain,</couplet>
<couplet>And with his strong course opens them again.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>O how her eyes and tears did lend and borrow!</line>
<line>Her eye seen in the tears, tears in her eye,</line>
<line>Both crystals, where they view&#8217;d each other&#8217;s sorrow,</line>
<line>Sorrow that friendly sighs sought still to dry;</line>
<couplet>But like a stormy day, now wind, now rain,</couplet>
<couplet>Sighs dry her cheeks, tears make them wet again.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Variable passions throng her constant woe,</line>
<line>As striving who should best become her grief;</line>
<line>All entertain&#8217;d, each passion labors so,</line>
<line>That every present sorrow seemeth chief,</line>
<couplet>But none is best; then join they all together,</couplet>
<couplet>Like many clouds consulting for foul weather.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>By this, far off, she hears some huntsman hallow;</line>
<line>A nurse&#8217;s song ne&#8217;er pleas&#8217;d her babe so well.</line>
<line>The dire imagination she did follow</line>
<line>This sound of hope doth labor to expel,</line>
<couplet>For now reviving joy bids her rejoice,</couplet>
<couplet>And flatters her it is Adonis&#8217; voice.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Whereat her tears began to turn their tide,</line>
<line>Being prison&#8217;d in her eye, like pearls in glass,</line>
<line>Yet sometimes falls an orient drop beside,</line>
<line>Which her cheek melts, as scorning it should pass</line>
<couplet>To wash the foul face of the sluttish ground,</couplet>
<couplet>Who is but drunken when she seemeth drown&#8217;d.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>O hard-believing love, how strange it seems!</line>
<line>Not to believe, and yet too credulous:</line>
<line>Thy weal and woe are both of them extremes;</line>
<line>Despair and hope makes thee ridiculous:</line>
<couplet>The one doth flatter thee in thoughts unlikely,</couplet>
<couplet>In likely thoughts the other kills thee quickly.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Now she unweaves the web that she hath wrought,</line>
<line>Adonis lives, and Death is not to blame;</line>
<line>It was not she that call&#8217;d him all to naught;</line>
<line>Now she adds honors to his hateful name:</line>
<couplet>She clepes him king of graves, and grave for kings,</couplet>
<couplet>Imperious supreme of all mortal things.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; quoth she, &#8220;sweet Death, I did but jest,</line>
<line>Yet pardon me, I felt a kind of fear</line>
<line>When as I met the boar, that bloody beast,</line>
<line>Which knows no pity, but is still severe;</line>
<couplet>Then, gentle shadow (truth I must confess),</couplet>
<couplet>I rail&#8217;d on thee, fearing my love&#8217;s decesse.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>&#8217;Tis not my fault, the boar provok&#8217;d my tongue,</line>
<line>Be wreak&#8217;d on him, invisible commander;</line>
<line>&#8217;Tis he, foul creature, that hath done thee wrong,</line>
<line>I did but act, he&#8217;s author of thy slander.</line>
<couplet>Grief hath two tongues, and never woman yet</couplet>
<couplet>Could rule them both without ten women&#8217;s wit.&#8221;</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Thus hoping that Adonis is alive,</line>
<line>Her rash suspect she doth extenuate,</line>
<line>And that his beauty may the better thrive,</line>
<line>With Death she humbly doth insinuate;</line>
<couplet>Tells him of trophies, statues, tombs, and stories</couplet>
<couplet>His victories, his triumphs, and his glories.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>&#8220;O Jove,&#8221; quoth she, &#8220;how much a fool was I,</line>
<line>To be of such a weak and silly mind,</line>
<line>To wail his death who lives, and must not die</line>
<line>Till mutual overthrow of mortal kind!</line>
<couplet>For he being dead, with him is beauty slain,</couplet>
<couplet>And beauty dead, black chaos comes again.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Fie, fie, fond love, thou art as full of fear</line>
<line>As one with treasure laden, hemm&#8217;d with thieves;</line>
<line>Trifles, unwitnessed with eye or ear,</line>
<line>Thy coward heart with false bethinking grieves.&#8221;</line>
<couplet>Even at this word she hears a merry horn,</couplet>
<couplet>Whereat she leaps, that was but late forlorn.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>As falcons to the lure, away she flies,</line>
<line>The grass stoops not, she treads on it so light,</line>
<line>And in her haste unfortunately spies</line>
<line>The foul boar&#8217;s conquest on her fair delight,</line>
<couplet>Which seen, her eyes as murd&#8217;red with the view,</couplet>
<couplet>Like stars asham&#8217;d of day, themselves withdrew;</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Or as the snail, whose tender horns being hit,</line>
<line>Shrinks backward in his shelly cave with pain,</line>
<line>And there, all smoth&#8217;red up, in shade doth sit,</line>
<line>Long after fearing to creep forth again;</line>
<couplet>So at his bloody view her eyes are fled</couplet>
<couplet>Into the deep-dark cabins of her head,</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Where they resign their office, and their light,</line>
<line>To the disposing of her troubled brain,</line>
<line>Who bids them still consort with ugly night,</line>
<line>And never wound the heart with looks again,</line>
<couplet>Who like a king perplexed in his throne,</couplet>
<couplet>By their suggestion, gives a deadly groan.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Whereat each tributary subject quakes,</line>
<line>As when the wind imprison&#8217;d in the ground,</line>
<line>Struggling for passage, earth&#8217;s foundation shakes,</line>
<line>Which with cold terror doth men&#8217;s minds confound.</line>
<couplet>This mutiny each part doth so surprise</couplet>
<couplet>That from their dark beds once more leap her eyes,</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>And being open&#8217;d, threw unwilling light</line>
<line>Upon the wide wound that the boar had trench&#8217;d</line>
<line>In his soft flank, whose wonted lily white</line>
<line>With purple tears, that his wound wept, was drench&#8217;d.</line>
<couplet>No flow&#8217;r was nigh, no grass, herb, leaf, or weed,</couplet>
<couplet>But stole his blood, and seem&#8217;d with him to bleed.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>This solemn sympathy poor Venus noteth,</line>
<line>Over one shoulder doth she hang her head;</line>
<line>Dumbly she passions, franticly she doteth,</line>
<line>She thinks he could not die, he is not dead;</line>
<couplet>Her voice is stopp&#8217;d, her joints forget to bow,</couplet>
<couplet>Her eyes are mad that they have wept till now.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Upon his hurt she looks so steadfastly,</line>
<line>That her sight dazzling makes the wound seem three,</line>
<line>And then she reprehends her mangling eye,</line>
<line>That makes more gashes where no breach should be.</line>
<couplet>His face seems twain, each several limb is doubled,</couplet>
<couplet>For oft the eye mistakes, the brain being troubled.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>&#8220;My tongue cannot express my grief for one,</line>
<line>And yet,&#8221; quoth she, &#8220;behold two Adons dead!</line>
<line>My sighs are blown away, my salt tears gone,</line>
<line>Mine eyes are turn&#8217;d to fire, my heart to lead:</line>
<couplet>Heavy heart&#8217;s lead, melt at mine eyes&#8217; red fire,</couplet>
<couplet>So shall I die by drops of hot desire.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Alas, poor world, what treasure hast thou lost!</line>
<line>What face remains alive that&#8217;s worth the viewing?</line>
<line>Whose tongue is music now? What canst thou boast</line>
<line>Of things long since, or any thing ensuing?</line>
<couplet>The flowers are sweet, their colors fresh and trim,</couplet>
<couplet>But true sweet beauty liv&#8217;d and died with him.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Bonnet nor veil henceforth no creature wear!</line>
<line>Nor sun nor wind will ever strive to kiss you:</line>
<line>Having no fair to lose, you need not fear,</line>
<line>The sun doth scorn you, and the wind doth hiss you.</line>
<couplet>But when Adonis liv&#8217;d, sun and sharp air</couplet>
<couplet>Lurk&#8217;d like two thieves, to rob him of his fair.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>And therefore would he put his bonnet on,</line>
<line>Under whose brim the gaudy sun would peep;</line>
<line>The wind would blow it off, and being gone,</line>
<line>Play with his locks; then would Adonis weep;</line>
<couplet>And straight, in pity of his tender years,</couplet>
<couplet>They both would strive who first should dry his tears.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>To see his face the lion walk&#8217;d along</line>
<line>Behind some hedge, because he would not fear him;</line>
<line>To recreate himself when he hath song,</line>
<line>The tiger would be tame, and gently hear him;</line>
<couplet>If he had spoke, the wolf would leave his prey,</couplet>
<couplet>And never fright the silly lamb that day.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>When he beheld his shadow in the brook,</line>
<line>The fishes spread on it their golden gills;</line>
<line>When he was by, the birds such pleasure took,</line>
<line>That some would sing, some other in their bills</line>
<couplet>Would bring him mulberries and ripe-red cherries:</couplet>
<couplet>He fed them with his sight, they him with berries.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>But this foul, grim, and urchin-snouted boar,</line>
<line>Whose downward eye still looketh for a grave,</line>
<line>Ne&#8217;er saw the beauteous livery that he wore&#8212;</line>
<line>Witness the entertainment that he gave.</line>
<couplet>If he did see his face, why then I know</couplet>
<couplet>He thought to kiss him, and hath kill&#8217;d him so.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>&#8217;Tis true, &#8217;tis true, thus was Adonis slain:</line>
<line>He ran upon the boar with his sharp spear,</line>
<line>Who did not whet his teeth at him again,</line>
<line>But by a kiss thought to persuade him there;</line>
<couplet>And nousling in his flank, the loving swine</couplet>
<couplet>Sheath&#8217;d unaware the tusk in his soft groin.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Had I been tooth&#8217;d like him, I must confess,</line>
<line>With kissing him I should have kill&#8217;d him first,</line>
<line>But he is dead, and never did he bless</line>
<line>My youth with his, the more am I accurs&#8217;d.&#8221;</line>
<couplet>With this she falleth in the place she stood,</couplet>
<couplet>And stains her face with his congealed blood.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>She looks upon his lips, and they are pale,</line>
<line>She takes him by the hand, and that is cold,</line>
<line>She whispers in his ears a heavy tale,</line>
<line>As if they heard the woeful words she told;</line>
<couplet>She lifts the coffer-lids that close his eyes,</couplet>
<couplet>Where lo, two lamps burnt out in darkness lies;</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Two glasses, where herself herself beheld</line>
<line>A thousand times, and now no more reflect,</line>
<line>Their virtue lost, wherein they late excell&#8217;d,</line>
<line>And every beauty robb&#8217;d of his effect.</line>
<couplet>&#8220;Wonder of time,&#8221; quoth she, &#8220;this is my spite,</couplet>
<couplet>That thou being dead, the day should yet be light.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Since thou art dead, lo here I prophesy,</line>
<line>Sorrow on love hereafter shall attend;</line>
<line>It shall be waited on with jealousy,</line>
<line>Find sweet beginning, but unsavory end;</line>
<couplet>ne&#8217;er settled equally, but high or low,</couplet>
<couplet>That all love&#8217;s pleasure shall not match his woe.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>It shall be fickle, false, and full of fraud,</line>
<line>Bud, and be blasted, in a breathing while,</line>
<line>The bottom poison, and the top o&#8217;erstraw&#8217;d</line>
<line>With sweets that shall the truest sight beguile;</line>
<couplet>The strongest body shall it make most weak,</couplet>
<couplet>Strike the wise dumb, and teach the fool to speak.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>It shall be sparing, and too full of riot,</line>
<line>Teaching decrepit age to tread the measures;</line>
<line>The staring ruffian shall it keep in quiet,</line>
<line>Pluck down the rich, enrich the poor with treasures;</line>
<couplet>It shall be raging mad, and silly mild,</couplet>
<couplet>Make the young old, the old become a child.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>It shall suspect where is no cause of fear,</line>
<line>It shall not fear where it should most mistrust,</line>
<line>It shall be merciful, and too severe,</line>
<line>And most deceiving when it seems most just;</line>
<couplet>Perverse it shall be, where it shows most toward,</couplet>
<couplet>Put fear to valor, courage to the coward.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>It shall be cause of war and dire events,</line>
<line>And set dissension &#8217;twixt the son and sire,</line>
<line>Subject and servile to all discontents,</line>
<line>As dry combustious matter is to fire.</line>
<couplet>Sith in his prime, Death doth my love destroy,</couplet>
<couplet>They that love best, their loves shall not enjoy.&#8221;</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>By this the boy that by her side lay kill&#8217;d</line>
<line>Was melted like a vapor from her sight,</line>
<line>And in his blood that on the ground lay spill&#8217;d,</line>
<line>A purple flow&#8217;r sprung up, check&#8217;red with white,</line>
<couplet>Resembling well his pale cheeks and the blood</couplet>
<couplet>Which in round drops upon their whiteness stood.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>She bows her head, the new-sprung flow&#8217;r to smell,</line>
<line>Comparing it to her Adonis&#8217; breath,</line>
<line>And says within her bosom it shall dwell,</line>
<line>Since he himself is reft from her by death.</line>
<couplet>She crops the stalk, and in the breach appears</couplet>
<couplet>Green-dropping sap, which she compares to tears.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>&#8220;Poor flow&#8217;r,&#8221; quoth she, &#8220;this was thy father&#8217;s guise&#8212;</line>
<line>Sweet issue of a more sweet-smelling sire&#8212;</line>
<line>For every little grief to wet his eyes;</line>
<line>To grow unto himself was his desire,</line>
<couplet>And so &#8217;tis thine, but know it is as good</couplet>
<couplet>To wither in my breast as in his blood.</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Here was thy father&#8217;s bed, here in my breast;</line>
<line>Thou art the next of blood, and &#8217;tis thy right.</line>
<line>Lo in this hollow cradle take thy rest,</line>
<line>My throbbing heart shall rock thee day and night;</line>
<couplet>There shall not be one minute in an hour</couplet>
<couplet>Wherein I will not kiss my sweet love&#8217;s flow&#8217;r.&#8221;</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Thus weary of the world, away she hies,</line>
<line>And yokes her silver doves, by whose swift aid</line>
<line>Their mistress mounted through the empty skies,</line>
<line>In her light chariot, quickly is convey&#8217;d,</line>
<couplet>Holding their course to Paphos, where their queen</couplet>
<couplet>Means to immure herself, and not be seen.</couplet>
</stanza>
