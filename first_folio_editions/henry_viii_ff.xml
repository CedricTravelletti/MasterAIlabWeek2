<LINE>Good morrow, and well met. How haue ye done</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Buck.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>An vntimely Ague</LINE>
<LINE>Staid me a Pri&#383;oner in my Chamber, when</LINE>
<LINE>Tho&#383;e Sunnes of Glory, tho&#383;e two Lights of Men</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>&#8217;Twixt Guynes and Arde,</LINE>
<LINE>I was then pre&#383;ent, &#383;aw them &#383;alute on Hor&#383;ebacke,</LINE>
<LINE>Beheld them when they lighted, how they clung</LINE>
<LINE>In their Embracement, as they grew together,</LINE>
<LINE>Which had they,</LINE>
<LINE>What foure Thron&#8217;d ones could haue weigh&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>Such a compounded one?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>Then you lo&#383;t</LINE>
<LINE>The view of earthly glory: Men might &#383;ay</LINE>
<LINE>Till this time Pompe was &#383;ingle, but now married</LINE>
<LINE>To one aboue it &#383;elfe. Each following day</LINE>
<LINE>Became the next dayes ma&#383;ter, till the la&#383;t</LINE>
<LINE>Made former Wonders, it&#8217;s. To day the French,</LINE>
<LINE>All Clinquant all in Gold, like Heathen Gods</LINE>
<LINE>Shone downe the Engli&#383;h; and to morrow, they</LINE>
<LINE>Made Britaine, India: Euery man that &#383;tood,</LINE>
<LINE>Shew&#8217;d like a Mine. Their Dwarfi&#383;h Pages were</LINE>
<LINE>As Cherubins, all gilt: the Madams too,</LINE>
<LINE>Not vs&#8217;d to toyle, did almo&#383;t &#383;weat to beare</LINE>
<LINE>The Pride vpon them, that their very labour</LINE>
<LINE>Was to them, as a Painting. Now this Maske</LINE>
<LINE>Was cry&#8217;de incompareable; and th&#8217; en&#383;uing night</LINE>
<LINE>Made it a Foole, and Begger. The two Kings</LINE>
<LINE>Equall in lu&#383;tre, were now be&#383;t, now wor&#383;t</LINE>
<LINE>As pre&#383;ence did pre&#383;ent them: Him in eye,</LINE>
<LINE>Still him in prai&#383;e, and being pre&#383;ent both,</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Twas &#383;aid they &#383;aw but one, and no Di&#383;cerner</LINE>
<LINE>Dur&#383;t wagge his Tongue in cen&#383;ure, when the&#383;e Sunnes</LINE>
<LINE>(For &#383;o they phra&#383;e &#8217;em) by their Heralds challeng&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>The Noble Spirits to Armes, they did performe</LINE>
<LINE>Beyond thoughts Compa&#383;&#383;e, that former fabulous Storie</LINE>
<LINE>Being now &#383;eene, po&#383;&#383;ible enough, got credit</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Buc.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Oh you go farre.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Nor.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As I belong to wor&#383;hip, and affe&#392;t</LINE>
<LINE>In Honor, Hone&#383;ty, the tra&#392;t of eu&#8217;ry thing,</LINE>

<LINE>Di&#383;tin&#392;tly his full Fun&#392;tion: who did guide,</LINE>
<LINE>I meane who &#383;et the Body, and the Limbes</LINE>
<LINE>Of this great Sport together?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Nor.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As you gue&#383;&#383;e:</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Buc.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I pray you who, my Lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Nor.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>All this was ordred by the good Di&#383;cretion</LINE>
<LINE>Of the right Reuerend Cardinall of Yorke.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Buc.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The diuell &#383;peed him: No mans Pye is freed</LINE>
<LINE>From his Ambitious finger. What had he</LINE>
<LINE>To do in the&#383;e fierce Vanities? I wonder,</LINE>
<LINE>That &#383;uch a Keech can with his very bulke</LINE>
<LINE>Take vp the Rayes o&#8217;th&#8217;beneficiall Sun,</LINE>
<LINE>And keepe it from the Earth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Nor.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Surely Sir,</LINE>
<LINE>There&#8217;s in him &#383;tuffe, that put&#8217;s him to the&#383;e ends:</LINE>
<LINE>For being not propt by Aunce&#383;try, who&#383;e grace</LINE>
<LINE>Chalkes Succe&#383;&#383;ors their way; nor call&#8217;d vpon</LINE>
<LINE>For high feats done to&#8217;th&#8217;Crowne; neither Allied</LINE>
<LINE>To eminent A&#383;&#383;i&#383;tants; but Spider-like</LINE>
<LINE>Out of his Selfe-drawing Web. O giues vs note,</LINE>
<LINE>The force of his owne merit makes his way</LINE>
<LINE>A guift that heauen giues for him, which buyes</LINE>
<LINE>A place next to the King.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Abur.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I cannot tell</LINE>
<LINE>What Heauen hath giuen him: let &#383;ome Grauer eye</LINE>
<LINE>Pierce into that, but I can &#383;ee his Pride</LINE>
<LINE>Peepe through each part of him: whence ha&#8217;s he that,</LINE>
<LINE>If not from Hell? The Diuell is a Niggard,</LINE>
<LINE>Or ha&#8217;s giuen all before, and he begins</LINE>
<LINE>A new Hell in him&#383;elfe.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Buc.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why the Diuell,</LINE>
<LINE>Vpon this French going out, tooke he vpon him</LINE>
<LINE>(Without the priuity o&#8217;th&#8217;King) t&#8217;appoint</LINE>
<LINE>Who &#383;hould attend on him? He makes vp the File</LINE>
<LINE>Of all the Gentry; for the mo&#383;t part &#383;uch</LINE>
<LINE>To whom as great a Charge, as little Honor</LINE>
<LINE>He meant to lay vpon: and his owne Letter</LINE>

<LINE>Mu&#383;t fetch him in, he Papers.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>By this, &#383;o &#383;icken&#8217;d their E&#383;tates, that neuer</LINE>
<LINE>They &#383;hall abound as formerly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Buc.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O many</LINE>
<LINE>Haue broke their backes with laying Mannors on &#8217;em</LINE>
<LINE>For this great Iourney. What did this vanity</LINE>
<LINE>But mini&#383;ter communication of</LINE>
<LINE>A mo&#383;t poore i&#383;&#383;ue.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Nor.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Greeuingly I thinke,</LINE>
