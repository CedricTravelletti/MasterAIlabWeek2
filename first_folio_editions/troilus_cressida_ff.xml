<speech>
<speaker>Pan.</speaker>
<line>Well, I haue told you enough of this: For my part, Ile not meddle nor make no farther. Hee that will haue a Cake out of the Wheate, must needes tarry the grinding.</line>

<line>Doth le&#383;&#383;er blench at &#383;ufferance, then I doe:</line>
<line>At Priams Royall Table doe I &#383;it;</line>
<line>And when faire Cre&#383;&#383;id comes into my thoughts,</line>
<line>So (Traitor) then &#383;he comes, when &#383;he is thence.</line>
</speech>

<speech>

<speaker>Troy.</speaker>
<line>I was about to tell thee, when my heart,</line>
<line>As wedged with a &#383;igh, would riue in twaine,</line>
<line>Least Hector, or my Father &#383;hould perceiue me:</line>
<line>I haue (as when the Sunne doth light a-scorne)</line>
<line>Buried this &#383;igh, in wrinkle of a &#383;mile:</line>
<line>But &#383;orrow, that is couch&#8217;d in &#383;eeming gladne&#383;&#383;e,</line>
<line>Is like that mirth, Fate turnes to &#383;udden &#383;adne&#383;&#383;e.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Pan.</speaker>
<line>And her haire were not &#383;omewhat darker then Helens, well go too, there were no more comparison be-tweene the Women. But for my part &#383;he is my Kinswo-man, I would not (as they tearme it) praise it, but I wold &#383;ome-body had heard her talke yesterday as I did: I will not dispraise your &#383;ister Ca&#383;&#383;andra's wit, but&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Troy.</speaker>
<line>Oh Pandarus! I tell thee Pandarus;</line>
<line>When I doe tell thee, there my hopes lye drown&#8217;d:</line>
<line>Reply not in how many Fadomes deepe</line>
<line>They lye indrench&#8217;d. I tell thee, I am mad</line>
<line>In Cre&#383;&#383;ids loue. Thou an&#383;wer'st &#383;he is Faire,</line>
<line>Powr'st in the open Vlcer of my heart,</line>
<line>Her Eyes, her Haire, her Cheeke, her Gate, her Voice,</line>
<line>Handlest in thy discourse. O that her Hand</line>
<line>(In whose comparison, all whites are Inke)</line>
<line>Writing their owne reproach; to whose &#383;oft &#383;eizure,</line>
<line>The Cignets Downe is harsh, and &#383;pirit of Sense</line>
<line>Hard as the palme of Plough-man. This thou tel'st me;</line>
<line>As true thou tel'st me, when I &#383;ay I loue her:</line>
<line>But &#383;aying thus, instead of Oyle and Balme,</line>
<line>Thou lai'st in euery gash that loue hath giuen me,</line>
<line>The Knife that made it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>

<line>Thou do'st not &#383;peake &#383;o much.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Pan.</speaker>
<line>Faith, Ile not meddle in't: Let her be as &#383;hee is, if &#383;he be faire, &#8216;tis the better for her: and &#383;he be not, &#383;he ha's the mends in her owne hands.</line>

<line>I haue had my Labour for my trauell, ill thought on of her, and ill thought on of you: Gone betweene and betweene, but &#383;mall thankes for my labour.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Troy.</speaker>
<line>What art thou angry Pandarus? what with me?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Pan.</speaker>
<line>Because &#383;he's Kinne to me, therefore &#383;hee's not &#383;o faire as Helen, and &#383;he were not kin to me, &#383;he would be as faire on Friday, as Helen is on Sunday. But what care I? I care not and &#383;he were a Black-a-Moore, &#8216;tis all one to me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Troy.</speaker>
<line>Say I &#383;he is not faire?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Troy.</speaker>
<line>I doe not care whether you doe or no, Shee's a Foole to &#383;tay behinde her Father: Let her to the Greeks, and &#383;o Ile tell her the next time I &#383;ee her: for my part, Ile meddle nor make no more i'th&#8217; matter.</line>

<line>I cannot fight vpon this Argument:</line>
<line>It is too &#383;taru&#8217;d a &#383;ubiect for my Sword,</line>
<line>But Pandarus: O Gods! How do you plague me?</line>
<line>I cannot come to Cre&#383;&#383;id but by Pandar,</line>

<line>And like as there were husbandry in Warre</line>
<line>Before the Sunne rose, hee was harnest lyte,</line>

<line>This man Lady, hath rob&#8217;d many beasts of their particular additions, he is as valiant as the Lyon, churlish as the Beare, &#383;low as the Elephant: a man into whom nature hath &#383;o crowded humors, that his valour is crusht into folly, his folly &#383;auced with discretion: there is no man hath a vertue, that he hath not a glimpse of, nor a-ny man an attaint, but he carries &#383;ome &#383;taine of it. He is melancholy without cause, and merry against the haire, hee hath the ioynts of euery thing, but euery thing &#383;o out of ioynt, that hee is a gowtie Briareus, many hands and no vse; or purblinded Argus, all eyes and no &#383;ight.</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Pan.</speaker>
<line>You haue no iudgement Neece; Hellen her &#383;elfe &#383;wore th&#8217; other day, that Troylus for a browne fauour (for &#383;o &#8216;tis I must confe&#383;&#383;e) not browne neither.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Cre.</speaker>
<line>No, but browne.</line>

<line>Why Paris hath colour inough.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Pan.</speaker>
<line>So he has.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Cre.</speaker>
<line>Then Troylus &#383;hould haue too much, if &#383;he prais&#8217;d him aboue, his complexion is higher then his, he hauing colour enough, and the other higher, is too flaming a praise for a good complexion, I had as lieue Hellens gol-den tongue had commended Troylus for a copper nose.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Pan.</speaker>
<line>I &#383;weare to you,</line>
<line>I thinke Hellen loues him better then Paris.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Cre.</speaker>
<line>Then &#383;hee's a merry Greeke indeed.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Pan.</speaker>
<line>Nay I am &#383;ure &#383;he does, &#383;he came to him th&#8217; other day into the compast window, and you know he has not past three or foure haires on his chinne.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Cres.</speaker>
<line>Indeed a Tapsters Arithmetique may &#383;oone bring his particulars as therein, to a totall.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Pand.</speaker>
<line>Why he is very yong, and yet will he within three pound lift as much as his brother Hector.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Cres.</speaker>
<line>Is he is &#383;o young a man, and &#383;o old a lifter?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Pan.</speaker>
<line>But to prooue to you that Hellen loues him, &#383;he came and puts me her white hand to his clouen chin.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Cres.</speaker>
<line>Iuno haue mercy, how came it clouen?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Pan.</speaker>
<line>Why, you know &#8216;tis dimpled, I thinke his &#383;myling becomes him better then any man in all Phrigia.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Cre.</speaker>
<line>Oh he &#383;miles valiantly.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Pan.</speaker>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Cre.</speaker>
<line>Oh yes, and 'twere a clow&#8217;d in Autumne.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Pan.</speaker>
<line>Why go to then, but to proue to you that Hellen loues Troylus.</line>

<line>Troylus wil &#383;tand to thee</line>
<line>Proofe, if youle prooue it &#383;o.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Pan.</speaker>
<line>Troylus? why he esteemes her no more then I e-steeme an addle egge.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Cre.</speaker>
<line>If you loue an addle egge as well as you loue an idle head, you would eate chickens i'th&#8217; &#383;hell.</line>
</speech>

<line>When that the Generall is not like the Hiue,</line>
<line>To whom the Forragers &#383;hall all repaire,</line>
<line>What Hony is expected? Degree being vizarded,</line>
<line>Th&#8217; vnworthiest &#383;hewes as fairely in the Maske.</line>

<line>Obserue degree, priority, and place,</line>
<line>Insisture, course, proportion, &#383;eason, forme,</line>
<line>Office, and custome, in all line of Order:</line>
<line>And therefore is the glorious Planet Sol</line>
<line>In noble eminence, enthron&#8217;d, and &#383;phear&#8217;d</line>
<line>Amid'st the other, whose med'cinable eye</line>

<line>In euill mixture to disorder wander,</line>
<line>What Plagues, and what portents, what mutiny?</line>
<line>What raging of the Sea? &#383;haking of Earth?</line>
<line>Commotion in the Windes? Frights, changes, horrors,</line>
<line>Diuert, and cracke, rend and deracinate</line>
<line>The vnity, and married calme of States</line>
<line>Quite from their fixure? O, when Degree is &#383;hak&#8217;d,</line>

<line>Power into Will, Will into Appetite,</line>
<line>And Appetite (an vniuersall Wolfe,</line>
<line>So doubly &#383;econded with Will, and Power)</line>

<line>Great Agamemnon:</line>

<line>Which from the tongue of roaring Typhon dropt,</line>
<line>Would &#383;eemes Hyperboles. At this fusty &#383;tuffe,</line>
<line>The large Achilles (on his prest-bed lolling)</line>
<line>From his deepe Chest, laughes out a lowd applause,</line>
<line>Cries excellent, &#8216;tis Agamemnon iust.</line>
<line>Now play me Nestor; hum, and &#383;troke thy Beard</line>
<line>As he, being drest to &#383;ome Oration:</line>

<line>Of paralels; as like, as Vulcan and his wife,</line>
<line>Yet god Achilles &#383;till cries excellent,</line>

<line>Arming to an&#383;wer in a night-Alarme,</line>
<line>And then (forsooth) the faint defects of Age</line>
<line>Must be the Scene of myrth, to cough, and &#383;pit,</line>

<line>As bankes of Lybia, though (Apollo knowes)</line>
<line>&#8216;Tis dry enough, wil with great &#383;peede of iudgement,</line>

<speaker>Nest.</speaker>
<line>Yes, &#8216;tis mo&#8217;t meet; who may you else oppose</line>
<line>That can from Hector bring his Honor off,</line>
<line>If not Achilles; though't be a &#383;portfull Combate,</line>
<line>Yet in this triall, much opinion dwels.</line>
<line>For heere the Troyans taste our deer'st repute</line>
<line>With their fin'st Pallate: and trust to me Vly&#383;&#383;es,</line>
<line>Our imputation &#383;hall be oddely poiz&#8217;d</line>
<line>In this wilde action. For the &#383;ucce&#383;&#383;e</line>
<line>(Although particular) &#383;hall giue a &#383;cantling</line>
<line>Of good or bad, vnto the Generall:</line>

<line>To their &#383;ubsequent Volumes, there is &#383;eene</line>
<line>The baby figure of the Gyant-ma&#383;&#383;e</line>
<line>Of things to come at large. It is &#383;uppos&#8217;d,</line>
<line>He that meets Hector, i&#383;&#383;ues from our choyse;</line>
<line>And choise being mutuall acte of all our &#383;oules,</line>
<line>Makes Merit her election, and doth boyle</line>
<line>As 'twere, from forth vs all: a man distill&#8217;d</line>
<line>Out of our Vertues; who miscarrying,</line>
<line>What heart from hence receyues the conqu'ring part</line>
<line>To &#383;teele a &#383;trong opinion to themselues,</line>
<line>Which entertain&#8217;d, Limbes are in his instruments,</line>

<line>The luster of the better yet to &#383;hew,</line>
<line>Shall &#383;hew the better. Do not consent,</line>
<line>That euer Hector and Achilles meete:</line>
<line>For both our Honour, and our Shame in this,</line>

<line>What glory our Achilles &#383;hares from Hector,</line>
<line>(Were he not proud) we all &#383;hould weare with him:</line>
<line>But he already is too insolent,</line>
<line>And we were better parch in Affricke Sunne,</line>
<line>Then in the pride and &#383;alt &#383;corne of his eyes</line>
<line>Should he &#383;cape Hector faire. If he were foyld,</line>
<line>Why then we did our maine opinion crush</line>
<line>In taint of our best man. No, make a Lott'ry,</line>
<line>And by deuice let blockish Aiax draw</line>
<line>The &#383;ort to fight with Hector: Among our &#383;elues,</line>
<line>Giue him allowance as the worthier man,</line>
<line>For that will physicke the great Myrmidon</line>
<line>Who broyles in lowd applause, and make him fall</line>
<line>His Crest, that prouder then blew Iris bends.</line>
<line>If the dull brainle&#383;&#383;e Aiax come &#383;afe off,</line>
<line>Wee'l dre&#383;&#383;e him vp in voyces: if he faile,</line>

<line>I know that foole.</line>
</speech>

<speech>

<speaker>Aiax.</speaker>
<line>Therefore I beate thee.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Ther.</speaker>
<line>Lo, lo, lo, lo, what modicums of wit he vtters: his euasions haue eares thus long. I haue bobb&#8217;d his Braine more then he has beate my bones: I will buy nine Spar-rowes for a peny, and his Piamater is not worth the ninth part of a Sparrow. This Lord (Achilles) Aiax who wears his wit in his belly, and his guttes in his head, Ile tell you what I &#383;ay of him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Achil.</speaker>
<line>Peace foole.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Ther.</speaker>
<line>I would haue peace and quietnes, but the foole will not: he there, that he, looke you there.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Achil.</speaker>
<line>Your last &#383;eruice was &#383;ufferance, 'twas not vo-luntary, no man is beaten voluntary: Aiax was heere the voluntary, and you as vnder an Impre&#383;&#383;e.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Ther.</speaker>
<line>E'ne &#383;o, a great deale of your wit too lies in your &#383;innewes, or else there be Liars. Hector &#383;hall haue a great catch, if he knocke out either of your braines, he were as good cracke a fustie nut with no kernell.</line>

<line>You know, a &#383;word imploy&#8217;d is perillous,</line>

<line>Who maruels then when Helenus beholds</line>
<line>A Grecian and his &#383;word, if he do &#383;et</line>
<line>The very wings of reason to his heeles:</line>
<line>Or like a Starre disorb&#8217;d. Nay, if we talke of Reason,</line>

<line>I take to day a Wife, and my election Is led on in the conduct of my Will; My Will enkindled by mine eyes and eares, Two traded Pylots 'twixt the dangerous &#383;hores Of Will, and Iudgement. How may I auoyde (Although my will distaste what it elected) The Wife I chose, there can be no euasion To blench from this, and to &#383;tand firme by honour. We turne not backe the Silkes vpon the Merchant When we haue &#383;poyl&#8217;d them; nor the remainder Viands We do not throw in vnrespectiue &#383;ame, Because we now are full. It was thought meete Paris &#383;hould do &#383;ome vengeance on the Greekes; Your breath of full consent bellied his Sailes, The Seas and Windes (old Wranglers) tooke a Truce, And did him &#383;eruice; he touch&#8217;d the Ports desir&#8217;d, And for an old Aunt whom the Greekes held Captiue, He brought a Grecian Queen, whose youth &amp; freshne&#383;&#383;e Wrinkles Apoll&#339;s, and makes &#383;tale the morning. Why keepe we her? the Grecians keepe our Aunt: Is &#383;he worth keeping? Why &#383;he is a Pearle, Whose price hath launch&#8217;d aboue a thousand Ships, And turn&#8217;d Crown&#8217;d Kings to Merchants. If you'l auouch, 'twas wisedome Paris went, (As you must needs, for you all cride, Go, go:) If you'l confe&#383;&#383;e, he brought home Noble prize, (As you must needs) for you all clapt your hands, And cride inestimable; why do you now The i&#383;&#383;ue of your proper Wisedomes rate, And do a deed that Fortune neuer did? Begger the estimation which you priz&#8217;d, Richer then Sea and Land? O Theft mo&#8217;t base! That we haue &#383;tolne what we do feare to keepe. But Theeues vnworthy of a thing &#383;o &#383;tolne, That in their Country did them that disgrace, We feare to warrant in our Natiue place. </line>

<line>All feares attending on &#383;o dire a proiect.</line>

<line>Sir, I propose not meerely to my &#383;elfe,</line>
<line>The pleasures &#383;uch a beauty brings with it:</line>
<line>But I would haue the &#383;oyle of her faire Rape</line>
<line>Wip&#8217;d off in honourable keeping her.</line>
<line>What Treason were it to the ransack&#8217;d Queene,</line>
<line>Disgrace to your great worths, and &#383;hame to me,</line>
<line>Now to deliuer her po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ion vp</line>
<line>On termes of base compulsion? Can it be,</line>
<line>That &#383;o degenerate a &#383;traine as this,</line>
<line>Should once &#383;et footing in your generous bosomes?</line>
<line>There's not the meanest &#383;pirit on our partie,</line>
<line>Without a heart to dare, or &#383;word to draw,</line>
<line>When Helen is defended: nor none &#383;o Noble,</line>
<line>Whose life were ill bestow&#8217;d, or death vnfam&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Where Helen is the &#383;ubiect. Then (I &#383;ay)</line>

<speaker>Hect.</speaker>
<line>Paris and Troylus, you haue both &#383;aid well:</line>
<line>And on the cause and question now in hand,</line>
<line>Haue gloz&#8217;d, but &#383;uperficially; not much</line>
<line>Vnlike young men, whom Aristotle thought</line>
<line>Vnfit to heare Morall Philosophie.</line>
<line>The Reasons you alledge, do more conduce</line>
<line>To the hot pa&#383;&#383;ion of distemp'red blood,</line>
<line>Then to make vp a free determination</line>
<line>'Twixt right and wrong: For pleasure, and reuenge,</line>
<line>Haue eares more deafe then Adders, to the voyce</line>
<line>Of any true decision. Nature craues</line>
<line>All dues be rendred to their Owners: now</line>
<line>What neerer debt in all humanity,</line>
<line>Then Wife is to the Husband? If this law</line>
<line>Of Nature be corrupted through affection,</line>
<line>And that great mindes of partiall indulgence,</line>
<line>To their benummed wills resist the &#383;ame,</line>
<line>There is a Law in each well-ordred Nation,</line>
<line>To curbe those raging appetites that are</line>
<line>Mo&#8217;t disobedient and refracturie.</line>
<line>If Helen then be wife to Sparta's King</line>
<line>(As it is knowne &#383;he is) these Morall Lawes</line>
<line>Of Nature, and of Nation, &#383;peake alowd</line>
<line>To haue her backe return&#8217;d. Thus to persist</line>
<line>In doing wrong, extenuates not wrong,</line>
<line>But makes it much more heauie. Hectors opinion</line>
<line>Is this in way of truth: yet nere the le&#383;&#383;e,</line>
<line>My &#383;pritely brethren, I propend to you</line>
<line>In resolution to keepe Helen &#383;till;</line>

<line>I would not wish a drop of Troian blood,</line>
<line>Spent more in her defence. But worthy Hector,</line>
<line>She is a theame of honour and renowne,</line>
<line>A &#383;purre to valiant and magnanimous deeds,</line>
<line>Whose present courage may beate downe our f&#339;s,</line>
<line>And fame in time to come canonize vs.</line>
<line>For I presume braue Hector would not loose</line>

Then ther's Achilles, a rare Enginer. If Troy be not taken till these two vndermine it, the wals will &#383;tand till they fall of them-selues. O thou great thunder-darter of Olympus, forget that thou art Ioue the King of gods: and Mercury, loose all the Serpentine craft of thy Caduceus, if thou take not that little little le&#383;&#383;e then little wit from them that they haue, which &#383;hort-arm&#8217;d ignorance it &#383;elfe knowes, is &#383;o abundant &#383;carse, it will not in circumuention deliuer a Flye from a Spider, without drawing the ma&#383;&#383;ie Irons and cutting the web: after this, the vengeance on the whole Camp, or rather the bone-ach, for that me thinkes is the curse dependant on those that warre for a placket. I haue &#383;aid my prayers and diuell, enuie, &#383;ay Amen: What ho? my Lord Achilles? </line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Patro.</speaker>
<line>You rascall.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Agamemnon, Vli&#383;&#383;es, Nestor, Diomedes, Aiax, and Chalcas</stagedir>

<stagedir>Exit.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>Ther.</speaker>
<line>Here is &#383;uch patcherie, &#383;uch iugling, and &#383;uch knauerie: all the argument is a Cuckold and a Whore, a good quarrel to draw emulations, factions, and bleede to death vpon: Now the dry Suppeago on the Subiect, and Warre and Lecherie confound all.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Agam.</speaker>
<line>Where is Achilles?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Patr.</speaker>
<line>Within his Tent, but ill dispos&#8217;d my Lord.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Agam.</speaker>
<line>Let it be knowne to him that we are here:</line>
<line>He &#383;ent our Me&#383;&#383;engers, and we lay by</line>
<line>Our appertainments, visiting of him:</line>
<line>Let him be told of, &#383;o perchance he thinke</line>
<line>We dare not moue the question of our place,</line>
<line>Or know not what we are.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Pat.</speaker>
<line>I &#383;hall &#383;o &#383;ay to him.</line>

<line>We &#383;aw him at the opening of his Tent, he is not &#383;icke.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Aia.</speaker>
<line>Yes, Lyon &#383;icke, &#383;icke of proud heart; you may call it Melancholly if will fauour the man, but by my head, it is pride; but why, why, let him &#383;how vs the cause? A word my Lord.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Nes.</speaker>
<line>What moues Aiax thus to bay at him?</line>

<line>Who, Thersites?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Vlis.</speaker>
<line>He.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Nes.</speaker>
<line>Then will Aiax lacke matter, if he haue lost his</line>
<line>Argument.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Vlis.</speaker>
<line>No, you &#383;ee he is his argument that has his argu-ment</line>
<line>Achilles.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Nest.</speaker>
<line>All the better, their fraction is more our wish then their faction; but it was a &#383;trong counsell that a Foole could disunite.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Vlis.</speaker>
<line>The amitie that wisedome knits, not folly may easily vntie. <stagedir>Enter Patroclus.</stagedir> Here comes Patroclus.</line>

<line>No Achilles with him?</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Vlis.</speaker>
<line>The Elephant hath ioynts, but none for curtesie:</line>
<line>His legge are legs for nece&#383;&#383;itie, not for flight.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Patro.</speaker>
<line>Achilles bids me &#383;ay he is much &#383;orry:</line>
<line>If any thing more then your &#383;port and pleasure,</line>
<line>Did moue your greatne&#383;&#383;e, and this noble State,</line>
<line>To call vpon him; he hopes it is no other,</line>
<line>But for your health, and your digestion &#383;ake;</line>
<line>An after Dinners breath.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Aga.</speaker>
<line>Heare you Patroclus:</line>
<line>We are too well acquainted with these answers:</line>
<line>But his euasion winged thus &#383;wift with &#383;corne,</line>
<line>Cannot but flye our apprehensions.</line>
<line>Much attribute he hath, and much the reason,</line>
<line>Why we ascribe it to him, yet all his vertues,</line>
<line>Not vertuously of his owne part beheld,</line>
<line>Doe in our eyes, begin to loose their glo&#383;&#383;e;</line>
<line>Yea, and like faire Fruit in an vnholdsome dish,</line>
<line>Are like to rot vntasted: goe and tell him,</line>
<line>We came to &#383;peake with him; and you &#383;hall not &#383;inne,</line>
<line>If you doe &#383;ay, we thinke him ouer proud,</line>
<line>And vnder hone&#383;t; in &#383;elfe-a&#383;&#383;umption greater</line>
<line>Then in the note of iudgement: &amp; worthier then himselfe</line>
<line>Here tends the &#383;auage &#383;trangene&#383;&#383;e he puts on,</line>
<line>Disguise the holy &#383;trength of their command:</line>
<line>And vnder write in an obseruing kinde</line>
<line>His humorous predominance, yea watch</line>
<line>His pettish lines, his ebs, his flowes, as if</line>
<line>The pa&#383;&#383;age and whole carriage of this action</line>
<line>Rode on his tyde. Goe tell him this, and adde,</line>
<line>That if he ouerhold his price &#383;o much,</line>
<line>Weele none of him; but let him, like an Engin</line>
<line>Not portable, lye vnder this report.</line>
<line>Bring action hither, this cannot goe to warre:</line>
<line>A &#383;tirring Dwarfe, we doe allowance giue,</line>
<line>Before a &#383;leeping Gyant: tell him &#383;o.</line>
</speech>

<speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Aiax.</speaker>
<line>What is he more then another?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Aga.</speaker>
<line>No more then what he thinkes he is.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Aia.</speaker>
<line>Is he &#383;o much, doe you not thinke, he thinkes himselfe a better man then I am?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Ag.</speaker>
<line>No question.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Aiax.</speaker>
<line>Will you &#383;ubscribe his thought, and &#383;ay he is?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Ag.</speaker>
<line>No, Noble Aiax, you are as &#383;trong, as valiant, as wise, no le&#383;&#383;e noble, much more gentle, and altogether more tractable.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Aiax.</speaker>
<line>Why &#383;hould a man be proud? How doth pride grow? I know not what it is.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Aga.</speaker>
<line>Your minde is the cleerer Aiax, and your vertues the fairer; he that is proud, eates vp himselfe; Pride is his owne Gla&#383;&#383;e, his owne trumpet, his owne Chronicle, and what euer praises it &#383;elfe but in the deede, deuoures the deede in the praise. </line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Vly&#383;&#383;es.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>Aiax.</speaker>
<line>I do hate a proud man, as I hate the ingendring of Toades.</line>

</speech>

<speech>

<line>Achilles will not to the field to morrow.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Ag.</speaker>
<line>What's his excuse?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Vlis.</speaker>
<line>He doth relye on none,</line>
<line>But carries on the &#383;treame of his dispose,</line>
<line>Without oberuance or respect of any,</line>
<line>In will peculiar, and in &#383;elfe admi&#383;&#383;ion.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Aga.</speaker>
<line>Why, will he not vpon our faire request,</line>
<line>Vntent his person, and &#383;hare the ayre with vs?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Vlis.</speaker>
<line>Things &#383;mall as nothing, for requests &#383;ake onely</line>
<line>He makes important; po&#383;&#383;est he is with greatne&#383;&#383;e,</line>
<line>And &#383;peakes not to himselfe, but with a pride</line>
<line>That quarrels at &#383;elfe-breath. Imagin&#8217;d wroth</line>
<line>Holds in his bloud &#383;uch &#383;wolne and hot discourse,</line>
<line>That twixt his mentall and his actiue parts,</line>
<line>Kingdom&#8217;d Achilles in commotion rages,</line>
<line>And batters gainst it &#383;elfe; what &#383;hould I &#383;ay?</line>
<line>He is &#383;o plaguy proud, that the death tokens of it,</line>
<line>Cry no recouery.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Ag.</speaker>
<line>Let Aiax goe to him.</line>
<line>Deare Lord, goe you and greete him in his Tent;</line>
<line>&#8216;Tis &#383;aid he holds you well, and will be led</line>
<line>At your request a little from himselfe.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Vlis.</speaker>
<line>O Agamemnon, let it not be &#383;o.</line>
<line>Weele consecrate the &#383;teps that Aiax makes,</line>
<line>When they goe from Achilles; &#383;hall the proud Lord,</line>
<line>That bastes his arrogance with his owne &#383;eame,</line>
<line>And neuer &#383;uffers matter of the world,</line>
<line>Enter his thoughts: &#383;aue &#383;uch as doe reuolue</line>
<line>And ruminate himselfe. Shall he be worshipt,</line>
<line>Of that we hold an Idoll, more then hee?</line>
<line>No, this thrice worthy and right valiant Lord,</line>
<line>Must not &#383;o &#383;taule his Palme, nobly acquir&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Nor by my will a&#383;&#383;ubiugate his merit,</line>
<line>As amply titled as Achilles is: by going to Achilles,</line>
<line>That were to enlard his fat already, pride,</line>
<line>And adde more Coles to Cancer, when he burnes</line>
<line>With entertaining great Hiperion.</line>
<line>This L[ord]. goe to him? Iupiter forbid,</line>
<line>And &#383;ay in thunder, Achilles goe to him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Nest.</speaker>
<line>O this is well, he rubs the veine of him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Dio.</speaker>
<line>And how his &#383;ilence drinkes vp this applause.</line>

<line>O no, you &#383;hall not goe.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Aia.</speaker>
<line>And a be proud with me, ile phese his pride: let me goe to him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Vlis.</speaker>
<line>Not for the worth that hangs vpon our quarrel.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Aia.</speaker>
<line>A paultry insolent fellow.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Nest.</speaker>
<line>How he describes himselfe.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Aia.</speaker>
<line>A &#383;hould not beare it &#383;o, a &#383;hould eate Swords first: &#383;hall pride carry it?</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Vlis.</speaker>
<line>A would haue ten &#383;hares.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Aia.</speaker>
<line>I will knede him, Ile make him &#383;upple, hee's not yet through warme.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Nest.</speaker>
<line>Force him with praises, poure in, poure in: his am-bition is dry.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Vlis.</speaker>
<line>My L[ord]. you feede too much on this dislike.</line>

<line>As greene as Aiax, and your braine &#383;o temper&#8217;d,</line>

<line>Nothing but our vndertakings, when we vowe to weepe &#383;eas, liue in fire, eate rockes, tame Tygers; think-ing it harder for our Mistre&#383;&#383;e to deuise imposition inough, then for vs to vnderg&#339; any difficultie imposed. This is the monstruositie in loue Lady, that the will is in-finite, and the execution confin&#8217;d; that the desire is bound-le&#383;&#383;e, and the act a &#383;laue to limit.</line>

Troylus &#383;hall be &#383;uch to Cre&#383;&#383;id, as what enuie can &#383;ay worst, &#383;hall be a mocke for his truth; and what truth can &#383;peake truest, not truer then Troy-lus. _</line>

<line>That through the &#383;ight I beare in things to loue,</line>
<line>I haue abandon&#8217;d Troy, left my po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ion,</line>
<line>Incur&#8217;d a Traitors name, expos&#8217;d my &#383;elfe,</line>

<line>To doubtfull fortunes, &#383;equestring from me all</line>
<line>That time, acquaintance, custome and condition,</line>
<line>Made tame, and mo&#8217;t familiar to my nature:</line>
<line>And here to doe you &#383;eruice am become,</line>
<line>As new into the world, &#383;trange, vnacquainted.</line>
<line>I doe beseech you, as in way of taste,</line>
<line>To giue me now a little benefit:</line>

<line>Desir&#8217;d my Cre&#383;&#383;id in right great exchange.</line>
<line>Whom Troy hath &#383;till deni&#8217;d: but this Anthenor,</line>
<line>I know is &#383;uch a wrest in their affaires;</line>
<line>That their negotiations all must &#383;lacke,</line>
<line>Wanting his mannage: and they will almost,</line>
<line>Giue vs a Prince of blood, a Sonne of Priam,</line>
<line>In change of him. Let him be &#383;ent great Princes,</line>
<line>And he &#383;hall buy my Daughter: and her presence,</line>

<line>To come as humbly as they vs&#8217;d to creepe to holy Altars.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Achil.</speaker>
<line>What am I poore of late?</line>
<line>&#8216;Tis certaine, greatne&#383;&#383;e once falne out with fortune,</line>
<line>Must fall out with men too: what the declin&#8217;d is,</line>
<line>He &#383;hall as &#383;oone reade in the eyes of others,</line>
<line>As feele in his owne fall: for men like butter-flies,</line>
<line>Shew not their mealie wings, but to the Summer:</line>
<line>And not a man for being &#383;imply man,</line>
<line>Hath any honour; but honour&#8217;d for those honours</line>
<line>That are without him; as place, riches, and fauour,</line>
<line>Prizes of accident, as oft as merit:</line>
<line>Which when they fall, as being &#383;lippery &#383;tanders;</line>
<line>The loue that leand on them as &#383;lippery too,</line>
<line>Doth one plucke downe another, and together</line>
<line>Dye in the fall. But &#8216;tis not &#383;o with me;</line>
<line>Fortune and I are friends, I doe enioy</line>
<line>At ample point, all that I did po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;e,</line>
<line>Saue these mens lookes: who do me thinkes finde out</line>
<line>Something not worth in me &#383;uch rich beholding,</line>
<line>As they haue often giuen. Here is Vli&#383;&#383;es,</line>
<line>Ile interrupt his reading: how now Vli&#383;&#383;es?</line>
</speech>

<line>Now great Thetis Sonne.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Achil.</speaker>
<line>What are you reading?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Vlis.</speaker>
<line>A &#383;trange fellow here</line>
<line>Writes me, that man, how dearely euer parted,</line>
<line>How much in hauing, or without, or in,</line>
<line>Cannot make boast to haue that which he hath;</line>
<line>Nor feeles not what he owes, but by reflection:</line>
<line>As when his vertues &#383;hining vpon others,</line>
<line>Heate them, and they retort that heate againe</line>
<line>To the first giuer.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Achil.</speaker>
<line>This is not &#383;trange Vli&#383;&#383;es:</line>
<line>The beautie that is borne here in the face,</line>
<line>The bearer knowes not, but commends it &#383;elfe,</line>
<line>Not going from it &#383;elfe: but eye to eye oppos&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Salutes each other with each others forme.</line>
<line>For &#383;peculation turnes not to it &#383;elfe,</line>
<line>Till it hath trauail&#8217;d, and is married there</line>
<line>Where it may &#383;ee it &#383;elfe: this is not &#383;trange at all.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Vlis.</speaker>
<line>I doe not &#383;traine it at the position,</line>
<line>It is familiar; but at the Authors drift,</line>
<line>Who in his circumstance, expresly proues</line>
<line>That no man is the Lord of any thing,</line>
<line>(Though in and of him there is much consisting,)</line>
<line>Till he communicate his parts to others:</line>
<line>Nor doth he of himselfe know them for ought,</line>
<line>Till he behold them formed in th 'applause,</line>
<line>Where they are extended: who like an arch reuerb'rate</line>
<line>The voyce againe; or like a gate of &#383;teele,</line>
<line>Fronting the Sunne, receiues and renders backe</line>
<line>His figure, and his heate. I was much rapt in this,</line>
<line>And apprehended here immediately:</line>
<line>The vnknowne Aiax;</line>
<line>Heauens what a man is there? a very Horse,</line>
<line>That has he knowes not what. Nature, what things there are.</line>
<line>Mo&#8217;t abiect in regard, and deare in vse.</line>
<line>What things againe mo&#8217;t deere in the esteeme,</line>
<line>And poore in worth: now &#383;hall we &#383;ee to morrow,</line>
<line>An act that very chance doth throw vpon him?</line>
<line>Aiax renown&#8217;d? O heauens, what &#383;ome men doe,</line>
<line>While &#383;ome men leaue to doe!</line>
<line>How &#383;ome men creepe in &#383;kittish fortunes hall,</line>
<line>Whiles others play the Ideots in her eyes:</line>
<line>How one man eates into anothers pride,</line>
<line>While pride is feasting in his wantonne&#383;&#383;e</line>
<line>To &#383;ee these Grecian Lords; why, euen already,</line>
<line>They clap the lubber Aiax on the &#383;houlder,</line>
<line>As if his foote were on braue Hectors brest,</line>
<line>And great Troy &#383;hrinking.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Achil.</speaker>
<line>I doe beleeue it:</line>
<line>For they past by me, as mysers doe by beggars,</line>
<line>Neither gaue to me good word, nor looke:</line>
<line>What are my deedes forgot?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Vlis.</speaker>
<line>Time hath (my Lord) a wallet at his backe,</line>
<line>Wherein he puts almes for obliuion:</line>
<line>A great &#383;iz&#8217;d monster of ingratitudes:</line>
<line>Those &#383;craps are good deedes past,</line>
<line>Which are deuour&#8217;d as fast as they are made,</line>
<line>Forgot as &#383;oone as done: perseuerance, deere my Lord,</line>
<line>Keepes honor bright, to haue done, is to hang</line>
<line>Quite out of fashion, like a rustie male,</line>
<line>In monumentall mockrie: take the instant way,</line>
<line>For honour trauels in a &#383;traight &#383;o narrow,</line>
<line>Where one but goes a breast, keepe then the paths</line>
<line>For emulation hath a thousand Sonnes,</line>
<line>That one by one pursue; if you giue way,</line>
<line>Or hedge aside from the direct forth right;</line>
<line>Like to an entred Tyde, they all rush by,</line>
<line>And leaue you hindmost:</line>
<line>Or like gallant Horse falne in first ranke,</line>
<line>Lye there for pauement to the abiect, neere</line>
<line>Ore-run and trampled on: then what they doe in present,</line>
<line>Though le&#383;&#383;e then yours in past, must ore-top yours:</line>
<line>For time is like a fashionable Hoste,</line>
<line>That &#383;lightly &#383;hakes his parting Guest by th&#8217; hand;</line>
<line>And with his armes out-stretcht, as he would flye,</line>
<line>Graspes in the commer: the welcome euer &#383;miles,</line>
<line>And farewels goes out &#383;ighing: O let not vertue &#383;eeke</line>
<line>Remuneration for the thing it was: for beautie, wit,</line>
<line>High birth, vigor of bone, desert in &#383;eruice,</line>
<line>Loue, friendship, charity, are &#383;ubiects all</line>
<line>To enuious and calumniating time:</line>
<line>One touch of nature makes the whole world kin:</line>
<line>That all with one consent praise new borne gaudes,</line>
<line>Though they are made and moulded of things past,</line>
<line>And goe to dust, that is a little guilt,</line>
<line>More laud then guilt oredusted.</line>
<line>The present eye praises the present obiect:</line>
<line>Then maruell not thou great and compleat man,</line>
<line>That all the Greekes begin to worship Aiax;</line>
<line>Since things in motion begin to catch the eye,</line>
<line>Then what not &#383;tirs: the cry went out on thee,</line>
<line>And &#383;till it might, and yet it may againe,</line>
<line>If thou would'st not entombe thy &#383;elfe aliue,</line>
<line>And case thy reputation in thy Tent;</line>
<line>Whose glorious deedes, but in these fields of late,</line>
<line>Made emulous mi&#383;&#383;ions 'mongst the gods themselues,</line>
<line>And draue great Mars to faction.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Achil.</speaker>
<line>Of this my priuacie,</line>
<line>I haue &#383;trong reasons.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Vlis.</speaker>
<line>But 'gainst your priuacie</line>
<line>The reasons are more potent and heroycall:</line>
<line>&#8216;Tis knowne Achilles, that you are in loue</line>
<line>With one of Priams daughters.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Achil.</speaker>
<line>Ha? knowne?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Vlis.</speaker>
<line>Is that a wonder? The prouidence that&#8217;s in a watchfull State, Knowes almost euery graine of Plut&#339;s gold; Findes bottome in th&#8217; vncomprehensiue deepes; Keepes place with thought; and almost like the gods, Doe thoughts vnuaile in their dumbe cradles: There is a mysterie (with whom relation durst neuer meddle) in the &#383;oule of State; Which hath an operation more diuine, Then breath or pen can giue expre&#383;&#383;ure to: All the commerse that you haue had with Troy, As perfectly is ours, as yours, my Lord. And better would it fit Achilles much, To throw downe Hector then Polixena. But it must grieue yong Pirhus now at home, When fame &#383;hall in her Iland &#383;ound her trumpe; And all the Greekish Girles &#383;hall tripping &#383;ing, Great Hectors &#383;ister did Achilles winne; But our great Aiax brauely beate downe him. Farewell my Lord: I as your louer &#383;peake; The foole &#383;lides ore the Ice that you &#383;hould breake.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Patr.</speaker>
<line>To this effect Achilles haue I mou&#8217;d you;</line>
<line>A woman impudent and mannish growne,</line>
<line>Is not more loth&#8217;d, then an effeminate man,</line>
<line>In time of action: I &#383;tand condemn&#8217;d for this;</line>
<line>They thinke my little &#383;tomacke to the warre,</line>
<line>And your great loue to me, restraines you thus:</line>
<line>Sweete, rouse your &#383;elfe; and the weake wanton Cupid</line>
<line>Shall from your necke vnloose his amorous fould,</line>
<line>And like a dew drop from the Lyons mane,</line>
<line>Be &#383;hooke to ayrie ayre.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Achil.</speaker>

<line>My fame is &#383;hrowdly gored.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Patr.</speaker>
<line>O then beware:</line>

<line><stagedir>Enter Thersi.</stagedir></line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Ther.</speaker>
<line>A wonder.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Achil.</speaker>
<line>What?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Ther.</speaker>
<line>Aiax goes vp and downe the field, asking for himselfe.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Achil.</speaker>
<line>How &#383;o?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Ther.</speaker>
<line>Hee must fight &#383;ingly to morrow with Hector, and is &#383;o prophetically proud of an heroicall cudgelling, that he raues in &#383;aying nothing.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Achil.</speaker>
<line>How can that be?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Ther.</speaker>
<line>Why he &#383;talkes vp and downe like a Peacock, a &#383;tride and a &#383;tand: ruminates like an hoste&#383;&#383;e, that hath no Arithmatique but her braine to &#383;et downe her recko-ning: bites his lip with a politique regard, as who &#383;hould &#383;ay, there were wit in his head and twoo&#8217;d out; and &#383;o there is: but it lyes as coldly in him, as fire in a flint, which will not &#383;hew without knocking. The mans vn-done for euer; for if Hector breake not his necke i'th&#8217; com-bat, heele break't himselfe in vaine-glory. He knowes not mee: I &#383;aid, good morrow Aiax; And he replyes, thankes Agamemnon. What thinke you of this man, that takes me for the Generall? Hee's growne a very land-fish, languagele&#383;&#383;e, a monster: a plague of o-pinion, a man may weare it on both &#383;ides like a leather Ierkin.</line>
</speech>

<line>Thou must be my Amba&#383;&#383;ador to him Thersites.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Ther.</speaker>
<line>Who, I: why, heele an&#383;wer no body: he pro-fe&#383;&#383;es not answering; &#383;peaking is for beggers: he weares his tongue in's armes: I will put on his presence; let Pa-troclus make his demands to me, you &#383;hall &#383;ee the Page-ant of Aiax.</line>

<line>No, but he's out a tune thus: what musicke will be in him when Hector has knockt out his braines, I know not: but I am &#383;ure none, vnle&#383;&#383;e the Fidler Apollo get his &#383;inewes to make catlings on.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Aga.</speaker>
<line>Which way would Hector haue it?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Aene.</speaker>
<line>He cares not, heele obey conditions.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Aga.</speaker>
<line>&#8216;Tis done like Hector, but &#383;ecurely done,</line>
<line>A little proudly, and great deale disprising</line>
<line>The Knight oppos&#8217;d.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Aene.</speaker>
<line>If not Achilles &#383;ir, what is your name?</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Achil.</speaker>
<line>If not Achilles, nothing.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Aene.</speaker>
<line>Therefore Achilles: but what ere, know this,</line>
<line>In the extremity of great and little:</line>
<line>Valour and pride excell themselues in Hector;</line>
<line>The one almost as infinite as all;</line>
<line>The other blanke as nothing: weigh him well:</line>
<line>And that which lookes like pride, is curtesie:</line>
<line>This Aiax is halfe made of Hectors bloud;</line>
<line>In loue wherof, halfe Hector &#383;taies at home:</line>
<line>Halfe heart, halfe hand, halfe Hector, comes to &#383;eeke</line>
<line>This blended Knight, halfe Troian, and halfe Greeke.</line>
</speech>

<speech>

<line>Here is &#383;ir, Diomed: goe gentle Knight,</line>
<line>Stand by our Aiax: as you and Lord Aeneas</line>
<line>Consent vpon the order of their fight,</line>
<line>So be it: either to the vttermost,</line>
<line>Or else a breach: the Combatants being kin,</line>
<line>Halfe &#383;tints their &#383;trife, before their &#383;trokes begin.</line>
</speech>

<speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Vlis.</speaker>
<line>The yongest Sonne of Priam;</line>
<line>A true Knight; they call him Troylus;</line>
<line>Not yet mature, yet matchle&#383;&#383;e, firme of word,</line>
<line>Speaking in deedes, and deedele&#383;&#383;e in his tongue;</line>
<line>Not &#383;oone prouok't, nor being prouok't, &#383;oone calm&#8217;d;</line>
<line>His heart and hand both open, and both free:</line>
<line>For what he has, he giues; what thinkes, he &#383;hewes;</line>
<line>Yet giues he not till iudgement guide his bounty,</line>
<line>Nor dignifies an impaire thought with breath:</line>
<line>Manly as Hector, but more dangerous;</line>
<line>For Hector in his blaze of wrath &#383;ubscribes</line>
<line>To tender obiects; but he, in heate of action,</line>
<line>Is more vindecatiue then iealous loue.</line>
<line>They call him Troylus; and on him erect,</line>
<line>A &#383;econd hope, as fairely built as Hector.</line>
<line>Thus &#383;aies Aeneas, one that knowes the youth,</line>
<line>Euen to his inches: and with priuate &#383;oule,</line>
<line>Did in great Illion thus translate him to me.</line>

<line>There they &#383;tand yet: and modestly I thinke,</line>
<line>The fall of euery Phrygian &#383;tone will cost</line>
<line>A drop of Grecian blood: the end crownes all,</line>
<line>And that old common Arbitrator, Time,</line>
<line>Will one day end it.</line>

<line>So to him we leaue it.</line>
<line>Mo&#8217;t gentle, and mo&#8217;t valiant Hector, welcome;</line>

<line>Wert thou the Oracle to tell me &#383;o,</line>
<line>I'ld not beleeue thee: henceforth guard thee well,</line>
<line>For Ile not kill thee there, not there, nor there,</line>
<line>But by the forge that &#383;tythied Mars his helme,</line>
<line>Ile kill thee euery where, yea, ore and ore.</line>
<line>You wisest Grecians, pardon me this bragge,</line>
<line>His insolence drawes folly from my lips,</line>
