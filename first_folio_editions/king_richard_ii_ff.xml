<SPEAKER>King.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We thanke you both, yet one but flatters vs,</LINE>
<LINE>As well appeareth by the cause you come,</LINE>
<LINE>Namely, to appeale each other of high treason.</LINE>
<LINE>Coosin of Hereford, what dost thou obiect</LINE>
<LINE>Against the Duke of Norfolke, Thomas Mowbray?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Bul.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>First, heauen be the record to my &#383;peech,</LINE>
<LINE>In the deuotion of a &#383;ubiects loue,</LINE>
<LINE>Tendering the precious &#383;afetie of my Prince,</LINE>
<LINE>And free from other misbegotten hate,</LINE>
<LINE>Come I appealant to this Princely presence.</LINE>
<LINE>Now Thomas Mowbray do I turne to thee,</LINE>
<LINE>And marke my greeting well: for what I &#383;peake,</LINE>
<LINE>My body &#383;hall make good vpon this earth,</LINE>
<LINE>Or my diuine &#383;oule an&#383;wer it in heauen.</LINE>
<LINE>Thou art a Traitor, and a Miscreant;</LINE>
<LINE>Too good to be &#383;o, and too bad to liue,</LINE>
<LINE>Since the more faire and christall is the &#383;kie,</LINE>
<LINE>The vglier &#383;eeme the cloudes that in it flye:</LINE>
<LINE>Once more, the more to aggrauate the note,</LINE>
<LINE>With a foule Traitors name &#383;tuffe I thy throte,</LINE>
<LINE>And wish (so please my Soueraigne) ere I moue,</LINE>
<LINE>What my tong &#383;peaks, my right drawn &#383;word may proue</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Mow.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let not my cold words heere accuse my zeale:</LINE>
<LINE>&#8216;Tis not the triall of a Womans warre,</LINE>
<LINE>The bitter clamour of two eager tongues,</LINE>
<LINE>Can arbitrate this cause betwixt vs twaine:</LINE>
<LINE>The blood is hot that must be cool&#8217;d for this.</LINE>
<LINE>Yet can I not of &#383;uch tame patience boast,</LINE>
<LINE>As to be husht, and nought at all to &#383;ay.</LINE>
<LINE>First the faire reuerence of your Highne&#383;&#383;e curbes mee,</LINE>
<LINE>From giuing reines and &#383;purres to my free &#383;peech,</LINE>
<LINE>Which else would post, vntill it had return&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>These tearmes of treason, doubly downe his throat.</LINE>
<LINE>Setting aside his high bloods royalty,</LINE>
<LINE>And let him be no Kinsman to my Liege,</LINE>
<LINE>I do defie him, and I &#383;pit at him,</LINE>
<LINE>Call him a &#383;landerous Coward, and a Villaine:</LINE>
<LINE>Which to maintaine, I would allow him oddes,</LINE>
<LINE>And meete him, were I tide to runne afoote,</LINE>
<LINE>Euen to the frozen ridges of the Alpes,</LINE>
<LINE>Or any other ground inhabitable,</LINE>
<LINE>Where euer Englishman durst &#383;et his foote.</LINE>
<LINE>Meane time, let this defend my loyaltie,</LINE>
<LINE>By all my hopes mo&#8217;t falsely doth he lie.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Bul.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pale trembling Coward, there I throw my gage,</LINE>
<LINE>Disclaiming heere the kindred of a King,</LINE>
<LINE>And lay aside my high bloods Royalty,</LINE>
<LINE>Which feare, not reuerence makes thee to except.</LINE>
<LINE>If guilty dread hath left thee &#383;o much &#383;trength,</LINE>
<LINE>As to take vp mine Honors pawne, then &#383;toope.</LINE>
<LINE>By that, and all the rites of Knight-hood else,</LINE>
<LINE>Will I make good against thee arme to arme,</LINE>
<LINE>What I haue &#383;poken, or thou canst deuise.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Mow.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I take it vp, and by that &#383;word I &#383;weare,</LINE>
<LINE>Which gently laid my Knight-hood on my &#383;houlder,</LINE>
<LINE>Ile an&#383;wer thee in any faire degree,</LINE>
<LINE>Or Chiualrous designe of knightly triall:</LINE>
<LINE>And when I mount, aliue may I not light,</LINE>
<LINE>If I be Traitor, or vniustly fight.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>King.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What doth our Cosin lay to Mowbraies charge?</LINE>
<LINE>It must be great that can inherite vs,</LINE>
<LINE>So much as of a thought of ill in him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Bul.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Looke what I &#383;aid, my life &#383;hall proue it true,</LINE>
<LINE>That Mowbray hath receiu&#8217;d eight thousand Nobles,</LINE>
<LINE>In name of lendings for your Highne&#383;&#383;e Soldiers,</LINE>
<LINE>The which he hath detain&#8217;d for lewd employments,</LINE>
<LINE>Like a false Traitor, and iniurious Villaine.</LINE>
<LINE>Besides I &#383;ay, and will in battaile proue,</LINE>
<LINE>Or heere, or elsewhere to the furthest Verge</LINE>
<LINE>That euer was &#383;uruey&#8217;d by English eye,</LINE>
<LINE>That all the Treasons for these eighteene yeeres</LINE>
<LINE>Complotted, and contriued in this Land,</LINE>
<LINE>Fetch&#8217;d from false Mowbray their first head and &#383;pring.</LINE>
<LINE>Further I &#383;ay, and further will maintaine</LINE>
<LINE>Vpon his bad life, to make all this good.</LINE>
<LINE>That he did plot the Duke of Glousters death,</LINE>
<LINE>Suggest his &#383;oone beleeuing aduersaries,</LINE>
<LINE>And consequently, like a Traitor Coward,</LINE>
<LINE>Sluc&#8217;d out his innocent &#383;oule through &#383;treames of blood:</LINE>
<LINE>Which blood, like &#383;acrificing Abels cries,</LINE>
<LINE>(Euen from the toongle&#383;&#383;e cauernes of the earth)</LINE>
<LINE>To me for iustice, and rough chasticement:</LINE>
<LINE>And by the glorious worth of my discent,</LINE>
<LINE>This arme &#383;hall do it, or this life be &#383;pent.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>King.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How high a pitch his resolution &#383;oares:</LINE>
<LINE>Thomas of Norfolke, what &#383;ayest thou to this?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Mow.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Oh let my Soueraigne turne away his face,</LINE>
<LINE>And bid his eares a little while be deafe,</LINE>
<LINE>Till I haue told this &#383;lander of his blood,</LINE>
<LINE>How God, and good men, hate &#383;o foule a lyar.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>King.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Mowbray, impartiall are our eyes and eares,</LINE>
<LINE>Were he my brother, nay our kingdomes heyre,</LINE>
<LINE>As he is but my fathers brothers &#383;onne;</LINE>
<LINE>Now by my Scepters awe, I make a vow,</LINE>
<LINE>Such neighbour-neerene&#383;&#383;e to our &#383;acred blood,</LINE>
<LINE>Should nothing priuiledge him, nor partialize</LINE>
<LINE>The vn-stooping firmene&#383;&#383;e of my vpright &#383;oule.</LINE>
<LINE>He is our &#383;ubiect (Mowbray) &#383;o art thou,</LINE>
<LINE>Free &#383;peech, and fearele&#383;&#383;e, I to thee allow.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Mow.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then Bullingbrooke, as low as to thy heart,</LINE>
<LINE>Through the false pa&#383;&#383;age of thy throat; thou lyest:</LINE>
<LINE>Three parts of that receipt I had for Callice,</LINE>
<LINE>Disburst I to his Highne&#383;&#383;e &#383;ouldiers;</LINE>
<LINE>The other part reseru&#8217;d I by consent,</LINE>
<LINE>For that my Soueraigne Liege was in my debt,</LINE>
<LINE>Vpon remainder of a deere Accompt,</LINE>
<LINE>Since last I went to France to fetch his Queene:</LINE>
<LINE>Now &#383;wallow downe that Lye. For Glousters death,</LINE>
<LINE>I &#383;lew him not; but (to mine owne disgrace)</LINE>
<LINE>Neglected my &#383;worne duty in that case:</LINE>
<LINE>For you my noble Lord of Lancaster,</LINE>
<LINE>The honourable Father to my f&#339;,</LINE>
<LINE>Once I did lay an ambush for your life,</LINE>
<LINE>A trespa&#383;&#383;e that doth vex my greeued &#383;oule:</LINE>
<LINE>But ere I last receiu&#8217;d the Sacrament,</LINE>
<LINE>I did confe&#383;&#383;e it, and exactly begg&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>Your Graces pardon, and I hope I had it.</LINE>
<LINE>This is my fault: as for the rest appeal&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>It i&#383;&#383;ues from the rancour of a Villaine,</LINE>
<LINE>A recreant, and mo&#8217;t degenerate Traitor,</LINE>
<LINE>Which in my &#383;elfe I boldly will defend,</LINE>
<LINE>And interchangeably hurle downe my gage</LINE>
<LINE>Vpon this ouer-weening Traitors foote,</LINE>
<LINE>To proue my &#383;elfe a loyall Gentleman,</LINE>
<LINE>Euen in the best blood chamber&#8217;d in his bosome.</LINE>
<LINE>In hast whereof, mo&#8217;t heartily I pray</LINE>

<LINE>I haue bin &#383;tudying, how to compare</LINE>

<LINE>And for because the world is populous,</LINE>
<LINE>And heere is not a Creature, but my &#383;elfe,</LINE>
<LINE>I cannot do it: yet Ile hammer't out.</LINE>
<LINE>My Braine, Ile proue the Female to my Soule,</LINE>
<LINE>My Soule, the Father: and these two beget</LINE>
<LINE>A generation of &#383;till breeding Thoughts;</LINE>
<LINE>And these &#383;ame Thoughts, people this Little World</LINE>
<LINE>In humors, like the people of this world,</LINE>
<LINE>For no thought is contented. The better &#383;ort,</LINE>
<LINE>As thoughts of things Diuine, are intermixt</LINE>
<LINE>With &#383;cruples, and do &#383;et the Faith it &#383;elfe</LINE>
<LINE>Against the Faith: as thus: Come litle ones: &amp; then again,</LINE>
<LINE>It is as hard to come, as for a Camell</LINE>
<LINE>To thred the posterne of a Needles eye.</LINE>
<LINE>Thoughts tending to Ambition, they do plot</LINE>
<LINE>Vnlikely wonders; how these vaine weake nailes</LINE>
<LINE>May teare a pa&#383;&#383;age through the Flinty ribbes</LINE>
<LINE>Of this hard world, my ragged prison walles:</LINE>
<LINE>And for they cannot, dye in their owne pride.</LINE>
<LINE>Thoughts tending to Content, flatter themselues,</LINE>
<LINE>That they are not the first of Fortunes &#383;laues,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor &#383;hall not be the last. Like &#383;illy Beggars,</LINE>
<LINE>Who &#383;itting in the Stockes, refuge their &#383;hame</LINE>
<LINE>That many haue, and others must &#383;it there;</LINE>
<LINE>And in this Thought, they finde a kind of ease,</LINE>
<LINE>Bearing their owne misfortune on the backe</LINE>
<LINE>Of &#383;uch as haue before indur&#8217;d the like.</LINE>
<LINE>Thus play I in one Prison, many people,</LINE>
<LINE>And none contented. Sometimes am I King;</LINE>
<LINE>Then Treason makes me wish my &#383;elfe a Beggar,</LINE>
<LINE>And &#383;o I am. Then crushing penurie,</LINE>
<LINE>Perswades me, I was better when a King:</LINE>
<LINE>Then am I king&#8217;d againe: and by and by,</LINE>
<LINE>Thinke that I am vn-king&#8217;d by Bullingbrooke,</LINE>

<LINE>But for the Concord of my State and Time,</LINE>

<LINE>I wasted Time, and now doth Time waste me:</LINE>
<LINE>For now hath Time made me his numbring clocke;</LINE>
<LINE>My Thoughts, are minutes; and with Sighes they iarre,</LINE>
<LINE>Their watches on vnto mine eyes, the outward Watch,</LINE>
<LINE>Whereto my finger, like a Dialls point,</LINE>

<LINE>Now &#383;ir, the &#383;ound that tels what houre it is,</LINE>

<LINE>Runs poasting on, in Bullingbrookes proud ioy,</LINE>
<LINE>While I &#383;tand fooling heere, his iacke o'th&#8217; Clocke.</LINE>
<LINE>This Musicke mads me, let it &#383;ound no more,</LINE>
