<LINE>Thou art a Traitor, and a Mi&#383;creant;</LINE>
<LINE>Too good to be &#383;o, and too bad to liue,</LINE>
<LINE>Since the more faire and chri&#383;tall is the skie,</LINE>

<SPEAKER>Mow.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let not my cold words heere accu&#383;e my zeale:</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis not the triall of a Womans warre,</LINE>
<LINE>The bitter clamour of two eager tongues,</LINE>

<LINE>Setting a&#383;ide his high bloods royalty,</LINE>
<LINE>And let him be no Kin&#383;man to my Liege,</LINE>
<LINE>I do de&#64257;e him, and I &#383;pit at him,</LINE>
<LINE>Call him a &#383;landerous Coward, and a Villaine:</LINE>
<LINE>Which to maintaine, I would allow him oddes,</LINE>
<LINE>And meete him, were I tide to runne afoote,</LINE>
<LINE>Euen to the frozen ridges of the Alpes,</LINE>
<LINE>Or any other ground inhabitable,</LINE>
<LINE>Where euer Engli&#383;hman dur&#383;t &#383;et his foote.</LINE>

<LINE>Which feare, not reuerence makes thee to except.</LINE>
<LINE>If guilty dread hath le&#64261; thee &#383;o much &#383;trength,</LINE>
<LINE>As to take vp mine Honors pawne, then &#383;toope.</LINE>
<LINE>By that, and all the rites of Knight-hood el&#383;e,</LINE>
<LINE>Will I make good again&#383;t thee arme to arme,</LINE>
<LINE>What I haue &#383;poken, or thou can&#383;t deui&#383;e.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Mow.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I take it vp, and by that &#383;word I &#383;weare,</LINE>
<LINE>Which gently laid my Knight-hood on my &#383;houlder,</LINE>
<LINE>Ile an&#383;wer thee in any faire degree,</LINE>
<LINE>Or Chiualrous de&#383;igne of knightly triall:</LINE>
<LINE>And when I mount, aliue may I not light,</LINE>

<LINE>That he did plot the Duke of Glou&#383;ters death,</LINE>
<LINE>Sugge&#383;t his &#383;oone beleeuing aduer&#383;aries,</LINE>
<LINE>And con&#383;equently, like a Traitor Coward,</LINE>
<LINE>Sluc&#8217;d out his innocent &#383;oule through &#383;treames of blood:</LINE>

<LINE>(Euen from the toongle&#383;&#383;e cauernes of the earth)</LINE>
<LINE>To me for iu&#383;tice, and rough cha&#383;ticement:</LINE>

<LINE>And heere is not a Creature, but my &#383;elfe,</LINE>
<LINE>I cannot do it: yet Ile hammer&#8217;t out.</LINE>
<LINE>My Braine, Ile proue the Female to my Soule,</LINE>
<LINE>My Soule, the Father: and the&#383;e two beget</LINE>
<LINE>A generation of &#383;till breeding Thoughts;</LINE>
<LINE>And the&#383;e &#383;ame Thoughts, people this Little World</LINE>
<LINE>In humors, like the people of this world,</LINE>
<LINE>For no thought is contented. The better &#383;ort,</LINE>
<LINE>As thoughts of things Diuine, are intermixt</LINE>
<LINE>With &#383;cruples, and do &#383;et the Faith it &#383;elfe</LINE>
<LINE>Again&#383;t the Faith: as thus: Come litle ones: &amp; then again,</LINE>
<LINE>It is as hard to come, as for a Camell</LINE>
<LINE>To thred the po&#383;terne of a Needles eye.</LINE>
<LINE>Thoughts tending to Ambition, they do plot</LINE>
<LINE>Vnlikely wonders; how the&#383;e vaine weake nailes</LINE>
<LINE>May teare a pa&#383;&#383;age through the Flinty ribbes</LINE>
<LINE>Of this hard world, my ragged pri&#383;on walles:</LINE>
<LINE>And for they cannot, dye in their owne pride.</LINE>
<LINE>Thoughts tending to Content, &#64258;atter them&#383;elues,</LINE>
<LINE>That they are not the &#64257;r&#383;t of Fortunes &#383;laues,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor &#383;hall not be the la&#383;t. Like &#383;illy Beggars,</LINE>
