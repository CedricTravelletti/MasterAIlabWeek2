<LINE>I, that is &#383;tudies god-like recompence.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Bero.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come on then, I will &#383;weare to &#383;tudie &#383;o,</LINE>
<LINE>To know the thing I am forbid to know:</LINE>
<LINE>As thus, to &#383;tudy where I well may dine,</LINE>
<LINE>When I to fa&#383;t expre&#383;&#383;ely am forbid.</LINE>
<LINE>Or &#383;tudie where to meete &#383;ome Mi&#383;tre&#383;&#383;e fine,</LINE>

<LINE>Studie to breake it, and not breake my troth.</LINE>
<LINE>If &#383;tudies gaine be thus, and this be &#383;o,</LINE>
<LINE>Studie knowes that which yet it doth not know,</LINE>
<LINE>Sweare me to this, and I will nere &#383;ay no.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Ferd.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The&#383;e be the &#383;tops that hinder &#383;tudie quite,</LINE>
<LINE>And traine our intelle&#392;ts to vaine delight.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Ber.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why? all delights are vaine, and that mo&#383;t vaine</LINE>
<LINE>Which with paine purchas&#8217;d, doth inherit paine,</LINE>
<LINE>As painefully to poare vpon a Booke,</LINE>
<LINE>To &#383;eeke the light of truth, while truth the while</LINE>
<LINE>Doth fal&#383;ely blinde the eye-&#383;ight of his looke:</LINE>
<LINE>Light &#383;eeking light, doth light of light beguile:</LINE>
<LINE>So ere you finde where light in darkene&#383;&#383;e lies,</LINE>
<LINE>Your light growes darke by lo&#383;ing of your eyes.</LINE>
<LINE>Studie me how to plea&#383;e the eye indeede,</LINE>
<LINE>By fixing it vpon a fairer eye,</LINE>
<LINE>Who dazling &#383;o, that eye &#383;hall be his heed,</LINE>
<LINE>And giue him light that it was blinded by.</LINE>
<LINE>Studie is like the heauens glorious Sunne,</LINE>
<LINE>That will not be deepe &#383;earch&#8217;d with &#383;awcy lookes:</LINE>
<LINE>Small haue continuall plodders euer wonne,</LINE>
<LINE>Saue ba&#383;e authoritie from others Bookes.</LINE>
<LINE>The&#383;e earthly Godfathers of heauens lights,</LINE>
<LINE>That giue a name to euery fixed Starre,</LINE>
<LINE>Haue no more profit of their &#383;hining nights,</LINE>
<LINE>Then tho&#383;e that walke and wot not what they are.</LINE>
<LINE>Too much to know, is to know nought but fame:</LINE>
<LINE>And euery Godfather can giue a name.</LINE>
