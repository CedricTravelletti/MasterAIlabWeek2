<LINE>Let Fame, that all hunt after in their liues, Liue registred vpon our brazen Tombes, And then grace vs in the disgrace of death: when &#383;pight of cormorant deuouring Time, Th&#8217; endeuour of this present breath may buy: That honour which &#383;hall bate his &#383;ythes keene edge, And make vs heyres of all eternitie. Therefore braue Conquerours, for &#383;o you are, That warre against your owne affections, And the huge Armie of the worlds desires. Our late edict &#383;hall &#383;trongly &#383;tand in force, Nauar &#383;hall be the wonder of the world. Our Court &#383;hall be a little Achademe, Still and contemplatiue in liuing Art.

<SPEAKER>Longauill.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am resolu&#8217;d, &#8216;tis but a three yeeres fast:</LINE>
<LINE>The minde &#383;hall banquet, though the body pine,</LINE>
<LINE>Fat paunches haue leane pates: and dainty bits,</LINE>
<LINE>Make rich the ribs, but bankerout the wits.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Dumane.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My louing Lord, Dumane is mortified,</LINE>
<LINE>The gro&#383;&#383;er manner of these worlds delights,</LINE>
<LINE>He throwes vpon the gro&#383;&#383;e worlds baser &#383;laues:</LINE>
<LINE>To loue, to wealth, to pompe, I pine and die,</LINE>
<LINE>With all these liuing in Philosophie.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Berowne.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I can but &#383;ay their protestation ouer,</LINE>
<LINE>So much, deare Liege, I haue already &#383;worne,</LINE>
<LINE>That is, to liue and &#383;tudy heere three yeeres.</LINE>
<LINE>But there are other &#383;trict obseruances:</LINE>
<LINE>As not to &#383;ee a woman in that terme,</LINE>
<LINE>Which I hope well is not enrolled there.</LINE>
<LINE>And one day in a weeke to touch no foode:</LINE>
<LINE>And but one meale on euery day beside:</LINE>
<LINE>The which I hope is not enrolled there.</LINE>
<LINE>And then to &#383;leepe but three houres in the night,</LINE>
<LINE>And not be &#383;eene to winke of all the day.</LINE>
<LINE>When I was wont to thinke no harme all night,</LINE>
<LINE>And make a darke night too of halfe the day:</LINE>
<LINE>Which I hope well is not enrolled there.</LINE>
<LINE>O, these are barren taskes, too hard to keepe,</LINE>
<LINE>Not to &#383;ee Ladies, &#383;tudy, fast, not &#383;leepe.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Ferd.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your oath is past, to pa&#383;&#383;e away from these.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Longa.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You &#383;wore to that Berowne, and to the rest.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Berow.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By yea and nay &#383;ir, than I &#383;wore in iest.</LINE>
<LINE>What is the end of &#383;tudy, let me know?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Fer.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why that to know which else wee &#383;hould not know.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Ber.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Things hid &amp; bard (you meane) fro[m] co[m]mon &#383;ense.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Ferd.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I, that is &#383;tudies god-like recompence.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Bero.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come on then, I will &#383;weare to &#383;tudie &#383;o,</LINE>
<LINE>To know the thing I am forbid to know:</LINE>
<LINE>As thus, to &#383;tudy where I well may dine,</LINE>
<LINE>When I to fast expre&#383;&#383;ely am forbid.</LINE>
<LINE>Or &#383;tudie where to meete &#383;ome Mistre&#383;&#383;e fine,</LINE>
<LINE>When Mistre&#383;&#383;es from common &#383;ense are hid.</LINE>
<LINE>Or hauing &#383;worne too hard a keeping oath,</LINE>
<LINE>Studie to breake it, and not breake my troth.</LINE>
<LINE>If &#383;tudies gaine be thus, and this be &#383;o,</LINE>
<LINE>Studie knowes that which yet it doth not know,</LINE>
<LINE>Sweare me to this, and I will nere &#383;ay no.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Ferd.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>These be the &#383;tops that hinder &#383;tudie quite,</LINE>
<LINE>And traine our intellects to vaine delight.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Ber.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why? all delights are vaine, and that mo&#8217;t vaine</LINE>
<LINE>Which with paine purchas&#8217;d, doth inherit paine,</LINE>
<LINE>As painefully to poare vpon a Booke,</LINE>
<LINE>To &#383;eeke the light of truth, while truth the while</LINE>
<LINE>Doth falsely blinde the eye-&#383;ight of his looke:</LINE>
<LINE>Light &#383;eeking light, doth light of light beguile:</LINE>
<LINE>So ere you finde where light in darkene&#383;&#383;e lies,</LINE>
<LINE>Your light growes darke by losing of your eyes.</LINE>
<LINE>Studie me how to please the eye indeede,</LINE>
<LINE>By fixing it vpon a fairer eye,</LINE>
<LINE>Who dazling &#383;o, that eye &#383;hall be his heed,</LINE>
<LINE>And giue him light that it was blinded by.</LINE>
<LINE>Studie is like the heauens glorious Sunne,</LINE>
<LINE>That will not be deepe &#383;earch&#8217;d with &#383;awcy lookes:</LINE>
<LINE>Small haue continuall plodders euer wonne,</LINE>
<LINE>Saue base authoritie from others Bookes.</LINE>
<LINE>These earthly Godfathers of heauens lights,</LINE>
<LINE>That giue a name to euery fixed Starre,</LINE>
<LINE>Haue no more profit of their &#383;hining nights,</LINE>
<LINE>Then those that walke and wot not what they are.</LINE>
<LINE>Too much to know, is to know nought but fame:</LINE>
<LINE>And euery Godfather can giue a name.</LINE>

I &#383;hall be forsworn (which is a great argument of falshood) if I loue. And how can that be true loue, which is falsly attempted? Loue is a fa-miliar, Loue is a Diuell. There is no euill Angell but Loue, yet Sampson was &#383;o tempted, and he had an excel-lent &#383;trength: Yet was Salomon &#383;o &#383;educed, and hee had a very good witte. Cupids Butshaft is too hard for Her-cules Clubbe, and therefore too much ods for a Spa-niards Rapier: The first and &#383;econd cause will not &#383;erue my turne: the Pa&#383;&#383;ado hee respects not, the Duello he regards not; his disgrace is to be called Boy, but his glorie is to &#383;ubdue men.

<LINE>O &#8216;tis more then neede.</LINE>
<LINE>Haue at you then affections men at armes,</LINE>
<LINE>Consider what you first did &#383;weare vnto:</LINE>
<LINE>To fast, to &#383;tudy, and to &#383;ee no woman:</LINE>
<LINE>Flat treason against the Kingly &#383;tate of youth.</LINE>
<LINE>Say, Can you fast? your &#383;tomacks are too young:</LINE>
<LINE>And abstinence ingenders maladies.</LINE>
<LINE>And where that you haue vow&#8217;d to &#383;tudie (Lords)</LINE>
<LINE>In that each of you haue forsworne his Booke.</LINE>
<LINE>Can you &#383;till dreame and pore, and thereon looke.</LINE>
<LINE>For when would you my Lord, or you, or you,</LINE>
<LINE>Haue found the ground of &#383;tudies excellence,</LINE>
<LINE>Without the beauty of a womans face;</LINE>
<LINE>From womens eyes this doctrine I deriue,</LINE>
<LINE>They are the Ground, the Bookes, the Achadems,</LINE>
<LINE>From whence doth &#383;pring the true Promethean fire.</LINE>
<LINE>Why, vniuersall plodding poysons vp</LINE>
<LINE>The nimble &#383;pirits in the arteries,</LINE>
<LINE>As motion and long during action tyres</LINE>
<LINE>The &#383;innowy vigour of the trauailer.</LINE>
<LINE>Now for not looking on a womans face,</LINE>
<LINE>You haue in that forsworne the vse of eyes:</LINE>
<LINE>And &#383;tudie too, the causer of your vow.</LINE>
<LINE>For where is any Author in the world,</LINE>
<LINE>Teaches &#383;uch beauty as a womans eye:</LINE>
<LINE>Learning is but an adiunct to our &#383;elfe,</LINE>
<LINE>And where we are, our Learning likewise is.</LINE>
<LINE>Then when our &#383;elues we &#383;ee in Ladies eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>With our &#383;elues.</LINE>
<LINE>Doe we not likewise &#383;ee our learning there?</LINE>
<LINE>O we haue made a Vow to &#383;tudie, Lords,</LINE>
<LINE>And in that vow we haue forsworne our Bookes:</LINE>
<LINE>For when would you (my Leege) or you, or you?</LINE>
<LINE>In leaden contemplation haue found out</LINE>
<LINE>Such fiery Numbers as the prompting eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>Of beauties tutors haue inrich&#8217;d you with:</LINE>
<LINE>Other &#383;low Arts intirely keepe the braine:</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore finding barraine practizers,</LINE>
<LINE>Scarce &#383;hew a haruest of their heauy toyle.</LINE>
<LINE>But Loue first learned in a Ladies eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>Liues not alone emured in the braine:</LINE>
<LINE>But with the motion of all elements,</LINE>
<LINE>Courses as &#383;wift as thought in euery power,</LINE>
<LINE>And giues to euery power a double power,</LINE>
<LINE>Aboue their functions and their offices.</LINE>
<LINE>It addes a precious &#383;eeing to the eye:</LINE>
<LINE>A Louers eyes will gaze an Eagle blinde.</LINE>
<LINE>A Louers eare will heare the lowest &#383;ound.</LINE>
<LINE>When the &#383;uspicious head of theft is &#383;topt.</LINE>
<LINE>Loues feeling is more &#383;oft and &#383;ensible,</LINE>
<LINE>Then are the tender hornes of Cockle Snayles.</LINE>
<LINE>Loues tongue proues dainty, Bachus gro&#383;&#383;e in taste,</LINE>
<LINE>For Valour, is not Loue a Hercules?</LINE>
<LINE>Still climing trees in the Hesperides.</LINE>
<LINE>Subtill as Sphinx, as &#383;weet and musicall,</LINE>
<LINE>As bright Apollo's Lute, &#383;trung with his haire.</LINE>
<LINE>And when Loue &#383;peakes, the voyce of all the Gods,</LINE>
<LINE>Make heauen drowsie with the harmonie.</LINE>
<LINE>Neuer durst P&#339;t touch a pen to write,</LINE>
<LINE>Vntill his Inke were tempred with Loues &#383;ighes:</LINE>
<LINE>O then his lines would rauish &#383;auage eares,</LINE>
<LINE>And plant in Tyrants milde humilitie.</LINE>
<LINE>From womens eyes this doctrine I deriue.</LINE>
<LINE>They &#383;parcle &#383;till the right promethean fire,</LINE>
<LINE>They are the Bookes, the Arts, the Achademes,</LINE>
<LINE>That &#383;hew, containe, and nourish all the world.</LINE>
<LINE>Else none at all in ought proues excellent.</LINE>
<LINE>Then fooles you were these women to forsweare:</LINE>
<LINE>Or keeping what is &#383;worne, you will proue fooles,</LINE>
<LINE>For Wisedomes &#383;ake, a word that all men loue:</LINE>
<LINE>Or for Loues &#383;ake, a word that loues all men.</LINE>
<LINE>Or for Mens &#383;ake, the author of these Women:</LINE>
<LINE>Or Womens &#383;ake, by whom we men are Men.</LINE>
<LINE>Let's once loose our oathes to finde our &#383;elues,</LINE>
<LINE>Or else we loose our &#383;elues, to keepe our oathes:</LINE>
<LINE>It is religion to be thus forsworne.</LINE>
