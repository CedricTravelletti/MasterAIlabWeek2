</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Mer.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A heauier taske could not haue beene impos&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Then I to &#383;peake my griefes vnspeakeable:</LINE>
<LINE>Yet that the world may witne&#383;&#383;e that my end</LINE>
<LINE>Was wrought by nature, not by vile offence,</LINE>
<LINE>Ile vtter what my &#383;orrow giues me leaue.</LINE>
<LINE>In Syracusa was I borne, and wedde</LINE>
<LINE>Vnto a woman, happy but for me,</LINE>
<LINE>And by me; had not our hap beene bad:</LINE>
<LINE>With her I liu&#8217;d in ioy, our wealth increast</LINE>
<LINE>By prosperous voyages I often made</LINE>
<LINE>To Epidamium, till my factors death,</LINE>
<LINE>And he great care of goods at randone left,</LINE>
<LINE>Drew me from kinde embracements of my &#383;pouse;</LINE>
<LINE>From whom my absence was not &#383;ixe moneths olde,</LINE>
<LINE>Before her &#383;elfe (almost at fainting vnder</LINE>
<LINE>The pleasing punishment that women beare)</LINE>
<LINE>Had made prouision for her following me,</LINE>
<LINE>And &#383;oone, and &#383;afe, arriued where I was:</LINE>
<LINE>There had &#383;he not beene long, but &#383;he became</LINE>
<LINE>A ioyfull mother of two goodly &#383;onnes:</LINE>
<LINE>And, which was &#383;trange, the one &#383;o like the other,</LINE>
<LINE>As could not be distinguish&#8217;d but by names.</LINE>
<LINE>That very howre, and in the &#383;elfe-&#383;ame Inne,</LINE>
<LINE>A meane woman was deliuered</LINE>
<LINE>Of &#383;uch a burthen Male, twins both alike:</LINE>
<LINE>Those, for their parents were exceeding poore,</LINE>
<LINE>I bought, and brought vp to attend my &#383;onnes.</LINE>
<LINE>My wife, not meanely prowd of two &#383;uch boyes,</LINE>
<LINE>Made daily motions for our home returne:</LINE>
<LINE>Vnwilling I agreed, alas, too &#383;oone wee came aboord.</LINE>
<LINE>A league from Epidamium had we &#383;aild</LINE>
<LINE>Before the alwaies winde-obeying deepe</LINE>
<LINE>Gaue any Tragicke Instance of our harme:</LINE>
<LINE>But longer did we not retaine much hope;</LINE>
<LINE>For what obscured light the heauens did grant,</LINE>
<LINE>Did but conuay vnto our fearefull mindes</LINE>
<LINE>A doubtfull warrant of immediate death,</LINE>
<LINE>Which though my &#383;elfe would gladly haue imbrac&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet the ince&#383;&#383;ant weepings of my wife,</LINE>
<LINE>Weeping before for what &#383;he &#383;aw must come,</LINE>
<LINE>And pitteous playnings of the prettie babes</LINE>
<LINE>That mourn&#8217;d for fashion, ignorant what to feare,</LINE>
<LINE>Forst me to &#383;eeke delayes for them and me,</LINE>
<LINE>And this it was: (for other meanes was none)</LINE>
<LINE>The Sailors &#383;ought for &#383;afety by our boate,</LINE>
<LINE>And left the &#383;hip then &#383;inking ripe to vs.</LINE>
<LINE>My wife, more carefull for the latter borne,</LINE>
<LINE>Had fastned him vnto a &#383;mall &#383;pare Mast,</LINE>
<LINE>Such as &#383;ea-faring men prouide for &#383;tormes:</LINE>
<LINE>To him one of the other twins was bound,</LINE>
<LINE>Whil'st I had beene like heedfull of the other.</LINE>
<LINE>The children thus dispos&#8217;d, my wife and I,</LINE>
<LINE>Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fixt,</LINE>
<LINE>Fastned our &#383;elues at eyther end the mast,</LINE>
<LINE>And floating &#383;traight, obedient to the &#383;treame,</LINE>
<LINE>Was carried towards Corinth, as we thought.</LINE>
<LINE>At length the &#383;onne gazing vpon the earth,</LINE>
<LINE>Disperst those vapours that offended vs,</LINE>
<LINE>And by the benefit of his wished light</LINE>
<LINE>The &#383;eas waxt calme, and we discouered</LINE>
<LINE>Two &#383;hippes from farre, making amaine to vs:</LINE>
<LINE>Of Corinth that, of Epidarus this,</LINE>
<LINE>But ere they came, oh let me &#383;ay no more,</LINE>
<LINE>Gather the &#383;equell by that went before.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Duk.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay forward old man, doe not breake off &#383;o,</LINE>
<LINE>For we may pitty, though not pardon thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Merch.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Oh had the gods done &#383;o, I had not now</LINE>
<LINE>Worthily tearm&#8217;d them mercile&#383;&#383;e to vs:</LINE>
<LINE>For ere the &#383;hips could meet by twice fiue leagues,</LINE>
<LINE>We were encountred by a mighty rocke,</LINE>
<LINE>Which being violently borne vp,</LINE>
<LINE>Our helpefull &#383;hip was &#383;plitted in the midst;</LINE>
<LINE>So that in this vniust diuorce of vs,</LINE>
<LINE>Fortune had left to both of vs alike,</LINE>
<LINE>What to delight in, what to &#383;orrow for,</LINE>
<LINE>Her part, poore &#383;oule, &#383;eeming as burdened</LINE>
<LINE>With le&#383;&#383;er waight, but not with le&#383;&#383;er w&#339;,</LINE>
<LINE>Was carried with more &#383;peed before the winde,</LINE>
<LINE>And in our &#383;ight they three were taken vp</LINE>
<LINE>By Fishermen of Corinth, as we thought.</LINE>
<LINE>At length another &#383;hip had &#383;eiz&#8217;d on vs,</LINE>
<LINE>And knowing whom it was their hap to &#383;aue,</LINE>
<LINE>Gaue healthfull welcome to their &#383;hip-wrackt guests,</LINE>
<LINE>And would haue reft the Fishers of their prey,</LINE>
<LINE>Had not their backe beene very &#383;low of &#383;aile;</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore homeward did they bend their course.</LINE>
<LINE>Thus haue you heard me &#383;euer&#8217;d from my bli&#383;&#383;e,</LINE>
<LINE>That by misfortunes was my life prolong&#8217;d,</LINE>
