<LINE>A heauier taske could not haue beene impos&#8217;d,</LINE>

<LINE>Was wrought by nature, not by vile offence,</LINE>
<LINE>Ile vtter what my &#383;orrow giues me leaue.</LINE>
<LINE>In <NAMEREF>Syracu&#383;a</NAMEREF> was I borne, and wedde</LINE>
<LINE>Vnto a woman, happy but for me,</LINE>
<LINE>And by me; had not our hap beene bad:</LINE>
<LINE>With her I liu&#8217;d in ioy, our wealth increa&#383;t</LINE>
<LINE>By pro&#383;perous voyages I often made</LINE>
<LINE>To <NAMEREF>Epidamium</NAMEREF>, till my fa&#392;tors death,</LINE>
<LINE>And he great care of goods at randone left,</LINE>
<LINE>Drew me from kinde embracements of my &#383;pou&#383;e;</LINE>
<LINE>From whom my ab&#383;ence was not &#383;ixe moneths olde,</LINE>
<LINE>Before her &#383;elfe (almo&#383;t at fainting vnder</LINE>
<LINE>The plea&#383;ing puni&#383;hment that women beare)</LINE>
<LINE>Had made proui&#383;ion for her following me,</LINE>
<LINE>And &#383;oone, and &#383;afe, arriued where I was:</LINE>
<LINE>There had &#383;he not beene long, but &#383;he became</LINE>
<LINE>A ioyfull mother of two goodly &#383;onnes:</LINE>
<LINE>And, which was &#383;trange, the one &#383;o like the other,</LINE>
<LINE>As could not be distingui&#383;h&#8217;d but by names.</LINE>
<LINE>That very howre, and in the &#383;elfe-&#383;ame Inne,</LINE>
<LINE>A meane woman was deliuered</LINE>
<LINE>Of &#383;uch a burthen Male, twins both alike:</LINE> 
<LINE>Tho&#383;e, for their parents were exceeding poore,</LINE>
<LINE>I bought, and brought vp to attend my &#383;onnes.</LINE>
<LINE>My wife, not meanely prowd of two &#383;uch boyes,</LINE>
<LINE>Made daily motions for our home returne:</LINE>
<LINE>Vnwilling I agreed, alas, too &#383;oone wee came aboord.</LINE>
<LINE>A league from <NAMEREF>Epidamium</NAMEREF> had we &#383;aild</LINE>
<LINE>Before the alwaies winde-obeying deepe</LINE>
<LINE>Gaue any Tragicke In&#383;tance of our harme:</LINE>
<LINE>But longer did we not retaine much hope;</LINE>
<LINE>For what ob&#383;cured light the heauens did grant,</LINE>
<LINE>Did but conuay vnto our fearefull mindes</LINE>
<LINE>A doubtfull warrant of immediate death,</LINE>
<LINE>Which though my &#383;elfe would gladly haue imbrac&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet the ince&#383;&#383;ant weepings of my wife,</LINE>
<LINE>Weeping before for what &#383;he &#383;aw mu&#383;t come,</LINE>
<LINE>And pitteous playnings of the prettie babes</LINE>
<LINE>That mourn&#8217;d for fa&#383;hion, ignorant what to feare,</LINE>
<LINE>For&#383;t me to &#383;eeke delayes for them and me,</LINE>
<LINE>And this it was: (for other meanes was none)</LINE>
<LINE>The Sailors &#383;ought for &#383;afety by our boate,</LINE>
<LINE>And left the &#383;hip then &#383;inking ripe to vs.</LINE>
<LINE>My wife, more carefull for the latter borne,</LINE>
<LINE>Had fa&#383;tned him vnto a &#383;mall &#383;pare Ma&#383;t,</LINE>
<LINE>Such as &#383;ea-faring men prouide for &#383;tormes:</LINE>
<LINE>To him one of the other twins was bound,</LINE>
<LINE>Whil&#8217;&#383;t I had beene like heedfull of the other.</LINE>
<LINE>The children thus di&#383;pos&#8217;d, my wife and I,</LINE>
<LINE>Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fixt,</LINE>
<LINE>Fa&#383;tned our &#383;elues at eyther end the ma&#383;t,</LINE>
<LINE>And floating &#383;traight, obedient to the &#383;treame,</LINE>
<LINE>Was carried towards <NAMEREF>Corinth</NAMEREF>, as we thought.</LINE>
<LINE>At length the &#383;onne gazing vpon the earth,</LINE>
<LINE>Di&#383;per&#383;t tho&#383;e vapours that offended vs,</LINE>
<LINE>And by the benefit of his wi&#383;hed light</LINE>
<LINE>The &#383;eas waxt calme, and we di&#383;couered</LINE>
<LINE>Two &#383;hippes from farre, making amaine to vs:</LINE>
<LINE>Of <NAMEREF>Corinth</NAMEREF> that, of <NAMEREF>Epidarm</NAMEREF> this,</LINE>

<SPEAKER>Merch.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Oh had the gods done &#383;o, I had not now</LINE>
<LINE>Worthily tearm&#8217;d them mercile&#383;&#383;e to vs:</LINE>
<LINE>For ere the &#383;hips could meet by twice fiue leagues,</LINE>
<LINE>We were encountred by a mighty rocke,</LINE>
<LINE>Which being violently borne vp,</LINE>
<LINE>Our helpefull &#383;hip was &#383;plitted in the mid&#383;t;</LINE>
<LINE>So that in this vniu&#383;t diuorce of vs,</LINE>
<LINE>Fortune had left to both of vs alike,</LINE>
<LINE>What to delight in, what to &#383;orrow for,</LINE>
<LINE>Her part, poore &#383;oule, &#383;eeming as burdened</LINE>
<LINE>With le&#383;&#383;er waight, but not with le&#383;&#383;er w&#339;,</LINE>
<LINE>Was carried with more &#383;peed before the winde,</LINE>
<LINE>And in our &#383;ight they three were taken vp</LINE>
<LINE>By Fi&#383;hermen of <NAMEREF>Corinth</NAMEREF>, as we thought.</LINE>
<LINE>At length another &#383;hip had &#383;eiz&#8217;d on vs,</LINE>
<LINE>And knowing whom it was their hap to &#383;aue,</LINE>
<LINE>Gaue healthfull welcome to their &#383;hip-wrackt gue&#383;ts,</LINE>
<LINE>And would haue reft the Fi&#383;hers of their prey,</LINE>
<LINE>Had not their backe beene very &#383;low of &#383;aile;</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore homeward did they bend their cour&#383;e.</LINE>
