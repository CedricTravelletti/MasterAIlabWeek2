<LINE>Which he &#383;tood &#383;eiz&#8217;d on, to the Conqueror:</LINE>
<LINE>Against the which, a Moity competent</LINE>

<LINE>To the Inheritance of Fortinbras,</LINE>
<LINE>Had he bin Vanquisher, as by the &#383;ame Cou'nant</LINE>
<LINE>And carriage of the Article designe,</LINE>

<LINE>Shark&#8217;d vp a List of Landle&#383;&#383;e Resolutes,</LINE>

<LINE><STAGEDIR>Exit Gho&#383;t.</STAGEDIR></LINE>
<LINE>We do it wrong, being &#383;o Maiesticall</LINE>
<LINE>To offer it the &#383;hew of Violence,</LINE>
<LINE>For it is as the Ayre, invulnerable,</LINE>
<LINE>And our vaine blowes, malicious Mockery.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Barn.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It was about to &#383;peake, when the Cocke crew.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Hor.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And then it &#383;tarted, like a guilty thing</LINE>
<LINE>Vpon a fearfull Summons. I haue heard,</LINE>
<LINE>The Cocke that is the Trumpet to the day,</LINE>
<LINE>Doth with his lofty and &#383;hrill-sounding Throate</LINE>
<LINE>Awake the God of Day: and at his warning,</LINE>
<LINE>Whether in Sea, or Fire, in Earth, or Ayre,</LINE>
<LINE>Th&#8217; extrauagant, and erring Spirit, hyes</LINE>
<LINE>To his Confine. And of the truth heerein,</LINE>
<LINE>This present Obiect made probation.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It faded on the crowing of the Cocke.</LINE>
<LINE>Some &#383;ayes, that euer 'gainst that Season comes</LINE>
<LINE>Wherein our Sauiours Birch is celebrated,</LINE>
<LINE>The Bird of Dawning &#383;ingeth all night long:</LINE>
<LINE>And then (they &#383;ay) no Spirit can walke abroad,</LINE>
<LINE>The nights are wholsome, then no Planets &#383;trike,</LINE>
<LINE>No Faiery talkes, nor Witch hath power to Charme:</LINE>
<LINE>So hallow&#8217;d, and &#383;o gracious is the time.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Hor.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So haue I heard, and do in part beleeue it.</LINE>
<LINE>But looke, the Morne in Ru&#383;&#383;et mantle clad,</LINE>
<LINE>Walkes o&#8217;re the dew of yon high Easterne Hill,</LINE>
<LINE>Breake we our Watch vp, and by my aduice</LINE>
<LINE>Let vs impart what we haue &#383;eene to night</LINE>
<LINE>Vnto yong Hamlet. For vpon my life,</LINE>
<LINE>This Spirit dumbe to vs, will &#383;peake to him:</LINE>

<LINE>A little more then kin, and le&#383;&#383;e then kinde.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>King.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How is it that the Clouds &#383;till hang on you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Ham.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not &#383;o my Lord, I am too much i'th&#8217; Sun.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Queen.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good Hamlet cast thy nightly colour off,</LINE>
<LINE>And let thine eye looke like a Friend on Denmarke.</LINE>
<LINE>Do not for euer with thy veyled lids</LINE>
<LINE>Seeke for thy Noble Father in the dust;</LINE>
<LINE>Thou know'st &#8216;tis common, all that liues must dye,</LINE>
<LINE>Pa&#383;&#383;ing through Nature, to Eternity.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Ham.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I Madam, it is common.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Queen.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If it be;</LINE>
<LINE>Why &#383;eemes it &#383;o particular with thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Ham.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Seemes Madam? Nay, it is: I know not Seemes:</LINE>
<LINE>&#8216;Tis not alone my Inky Cloake (good Mother)</LINE>
<LINE>Nor Customary &#383;uites of &#383;olemne Blacke,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor windy &#383;uspiration of forc&#8217;d breath,</LINE>
<LINE>No, nor the fruitfull Riuer in the Eye,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor the deiected hauiour of the Visage,</LINE>
<LINE>Together with all Formes, Moods, &#383;hewes of Griefe,</LINE>
<LINE>That can denote me truly. These indeed Seeme,</LINE>
<LINE>For they are actions that a man might play:</LINE>
<LINE>But I haue that Within, which pa&#383;&#383;eth &#383;how;</LINE>
<LINE>These, but the Trappings, and the Suites of w&#339;.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>King.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8216;Tis &#383;weet and commendable</LINE>
<LINE>In your Nature Hamlet,</LINE>
<LINE>To giue these mourning duties to your Father:</LINE>
<LINE>But you must know, your Father lo&#383;t a Father,</LINE>
<LINE>That Father lo&#383;t, lo&#383;t his, and the Suruiuer bound</LINE>
<LINE>In filiall Obligation, for &#383;ome terme</LINE>
<LINE>To do obsequious Sorrow. But to perseuer</LINE>
<LINE>In obstinate Condolement, is a course</LINE>
<LINE>Of impious &#383;tubbornne&#383;&#383;e. &#8216;Tis vnmanly greefe,</LINE>
<LINE>It &#383;hewes a will mo&#8217;t incorrect to Heauen,</LINE>
<LINE>A Heart vnfortified, a Minde impatient,</LINE>
<LINE>An Vnderstanding &#383;imple, and vnschool&#8217;d:</LINE>
<LINE>For, what we know must be, and is as common</LINE>
<LINE>As any the mo&#8217;t vulgar thing to &#383;ence,</LINE>
<LINE>Why &#383;hould we in our peeuish Opposition</LINE>
<LINE>Take it to heart? Fye, &#8216;tis a fault to Heauen,</LINE>
<LINE>A fault against the Dead, a fault to Nature,</LINE>
<LINE>To Reason mo&#8217;t absurd, whose common Theame</LINE>
<LINE>Is death of Fathers, and who &#383;till hath cried,</LINE>
<LINE>From the first Coarse, till he that dyed to day,</LINE>
<LINE>This must be &#383;o. We pray you throw to earth</LINE>
<LINE>This vnpreuayling w&#339;, and thinke of vs</LINE>

<LINE>Pale as his &#383;hirt, his knees knocking each other,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Ophe.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He tooke me by the wrist, and held me hard;</LINE>

<LINE>And with his other hand thus o&#8217;re his brow,</LINE>
<LINE>He fals to &#383;uch perusall of my face,</LINE>
<LINE>As he would draw it. Long &#383;taid he &#383;o,</LINE>
<LINE>At last, a little &#383;haking of mine Arme:</LINE>
<LINE>And thrice his head thus wauing vp and downe;</LINE>
<LINE>He rais&#8217;d a &#383;igh, &#383;o pittious and profound,</LINE>
<LINE>That it did &#383;eeme to &#383;hatter all his bulke,</LINE>
<LINE>And end his being. That done, he lets me goe,</LINE>
<LINE>And with his head ouer his &#383;houlders turn&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>He &#383;eem&#8217;d to finde his way without his eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>For out a dores he went without their helpe;</LINE>

<LINE>Goe with me, I will goe &#383;eeke the King,</LINE>
<LINE>This is the very extasie of Loue,</LINE>

<LINE>And leads the will to desperate Vndertakings,</LINE>
<LINE>As oft as any pa&#383;&#383;ion vnder Heauen,</LINE>
<LINE>That does afflict our Natures. I am &#383;orrie,</LINE>
<LINE>What haue you giuen him any hard words of late?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Ophe.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No my good Lord: but as you did command,</LINE>

<LINE>His acce&#383;&#383;e to me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Pol.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That hath made him mad.</LINE>
<LINE>I am &#383;orrie that with better &#383;peed and iudgement</LINE>
<LINE>I had not quoted him. I feare he did but trifle,</LINE>
<LINE>And meant to wracke thee: but beshrew my iealousie:</LINE>
<LINE>It &#383;eemes it is as proper to our Age,</LINE>
<LINE>To cast beyond our &#383;elues in our Opinions,</LINE>
<LINE>As it is common for the yonger &#383;ort</LINE>
<LINE>To lacke discretion. Come, go we to the King,</LINE>
<LINE>This must be knowne, being kept close might moue</LINE>
<LINE>More greefe to hide, then hate to vtter loue. </LINE>

<LINE>What are they Children? Who maintains 'em?</LINE>
<LINE>How are they escorted? Will they pursue the Quality no</LINE>

<SPEAKER>1.Play.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What &#383;peech, my Lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Ham.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I heard thee &#383;peak me a &#383;peech once, but it was</LINE>
<LINE>neuer Acted: or if it was, not aboue once, for the Play I</LINE>
<LINE>remember pleas&#8217;d not the Million, 'twas Cauiarie to the</LINE>
<LINE>Generall: but it was (as I receiu&#8217;d it, and others, whose</LINE>
<LINE>iudgement in &#383;uch matters, cried in the top of mine) an</LINE>
<LINE>excellent Play; well digested in the Sc&#339;nes, &#383;et downe</LINE>
<LINE>with as much modestie, as cunning. I remember one &#383;aid,</LINE>
<LINE>there was no Sallets in the lines, to make the matter &#383;a-uory;</LINE>
<LINE>nor no matter in the phrase, that might indite the</LINE>
<LINE>Author of affectation, but cal&#8217;d it an hone&#383;t method. One</LINE>
<LINE>cheefe Speech in it, I cheefely lou&#8217;d, 'twas Aeneas Tale</LINE>
<LINE>to Dido, and thereabout of it especially, where he &#383;peaks</LINE>
<LINE>of Priams &#383;laughter. If it liue in your memory, begin at</LINE>
<LINE>this Line, let me &#383;ee, let me &#383;ee: The rugged Pyrrhus like</LINE>
<LINE>th&#8217; Hyrcanian Beast. It is not &#383;o: it begins with Pyrrhus</LINE>
<LINE>The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose Sable Armes</LINE>
<LINE>Blacke as his purpose, did the night resemble</LINE>
<LINE>When he lay couched in the Ominous Horse,</LINE>
<LINE>Hath now this dread and blacke Complexion &#383;mear&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>With Heraldry more dismall: Head to foote</LINE>
<LINE>Now is he to take Geulles, horridly Trick&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>With blood of Fathers, Mothers, Daughters, Sonnes,</LINE>
<LINE>Bak&#8217;d and impasted with the parching &#383;treets,</LINE>
<LINE>That lend a tyrannous, and damned light</LINE>
<LINE>To their vilde Murthers, roasted in wrath and fire,</LINE>
<LINE>And thus o&#8217;re-sized with coagulate gore,</LINE>
<LINE>With eyes like Carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus</LINE>
<LINE>Olde Grandsire Priam &#383;eekes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Pol.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fore God, my Lord, well &#383;poken, with good ac-cent,</LINE>
<LINE>and good discretion.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1.Player.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Anon he findes him,</LINE>
<LINE>Striking too &#383;hort at Greekes. His anticke Sword,</LINE>
<LINE>Rebellious to his Arme, lyes where it falles</LINE>
<LINE>Repugnant to command: vnequall match,</LINE>
<LINE>Pyrrhus at Priam driues, in Rage &#383;trikes wide:</LINE>
<LINE>But with the whiffe and winde of his fell Sword,</LINE>
<LINE>Th&#8217; vnnerued Father fals. Then &#383;ensele&#383;&#383;e Illium,</LINE>
<LINE>Seeming to feele his blow, with flaming top</LINE>
<LINE>Stoopes to his Bace, and with a hideous crash</LINE>
<LINE>Takes Prisoner Pyrrhus eare. For l&#339;, his Sword</LINE>
<LINE>Which was declining on the Milkie head</LINE>
<LINE>Of Reuerend Priam, &#383;eem&#8217;d i'th&#8217; Ayre to &#383;ticke:</LINE>
<LINE>So as a painted Tyrant Pyrrhus &#383;tood,</LINE>
<LINE>And like a Newtrall to his will and matter, did nothing.</LINE>
<LINE>But as we often &#383;ee against &#383;ome &#383;torme,</LINE>
<LINE>A &#383;ilence in the Heauens, the Racke &#383;tand &#383;till,</LINE>
<LINE>The bold windes &#383;peechle&#383;&#383;e, and the Orbe below</LINE>
<LINE>As hush as death: Anon the dreadfull Thunder</LINE>
<LINE>Doth rend the Region. So after Pyrrhus pause,</LINE>
<LINE>A rowsed Vengeance &#383;ets him new a-worke,</LINE>
<LINE>And neuer did the Cyclops hammers fall</LINE>
<LINE>On Mars his Armours, forg&#8217;d for proofe Eterne,</LINE>
<LINE>With le&#383;&#383;e remorse then Pyrrhus bleeding &#383;word</LINE>
<LINE>Now falles on Priam.</LINE>
<LINE>Out, out, thou Strumpet-Fortune, all you Gods,</LINE>
<LINE>In generall Synod take away her power:</LINE>
<LINE>Breake all the Spokes and Fallies from her wheele,</LINE>
<LINE>And boule the round Naue downe the hill of Heauen,</LINE>

<LINE>When &#383;he &#383;aw Pyrrhus make malicious &#383;port</LINE>
<LINE>In mincing with his Sword her Husbands limbes,</LINE>
<LINE>The instant Burst of Clamour that &#383;he made</LINE>
<LINE>(Vnle&#383;&#383;e things mortall moue them not at all)</LINE>
<LINE>Would haue made milche the Burning eyes of Heauen,</LINE>

<SPEAKER>Ham.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I &#383;o, God buy'ye: Now I am alone.</LINE>
<LINE>Oh what a Rogue and Pesant &#383;laue am I?</LINE>
<LINE>Is it not monstrous that this Player heere,</LINE>
<LINE>But in a Fixion, in a dreame of Pa&#383;&#383;ion,</LINE>
<LINE>Could force his &#383;oule &#383;o to his whole conceit,</LINE>
<LINE>That from her working, all his visage warm&#8217;d;</LINE>
<LINE>Teares in his eyes, distraction in's Aspect,</LINE>
<LINE>A broken voyce, and his whole Function &#383;uiting</LINE>
<LINE>With Formes, to his Conceit? And all for nothing?</LINE>
<LINE>For Hecuba?</LINE>
<LINE>What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,</LINE>
<LINE>That he &#383;hould weepe for her? What would he doe,</LINE>
<LINE>Had he the Motiue and the Cue for pa&#383;&#383;ion</LINE>
<LINE>That I haue? He would drowne the Stage with teares,</LINE>
<LINE>And cleaue the generall eare with horrid &#383;peech:</LINE>
<LINE>Make mad the guilty, and apale the free,</LINE>
<LINE>Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed,</LINE>
<LINE>The very faculty of Eyes and Eares. Yet I,</LINE>
<LINE>A dull and muddy-metled Rascall, peake</LINE>
<LINE>Like Iohn a-dreames, vnpregnant of my cause,</LINE>
<LINE>And can &#383;ay nothing: No, not for a King,</LINE>
<LINE>Vpon whose property, and mo&#8217;t deere life,</LINE>
<LINE>A damn&#8217;d defeate was made. Am I a Coward?</LINE>
<LINE>Who calles me Villaine? breakes my pate a-cro&#383;&#383;e?</LINE>
<LINE>Pluckes off my Beard, and blowes it in my face?</LINE>
<LINE>Tweakes me by'th&#8217; Nose? giues me the Lye i'th&#8217; Throate,</LINE>
<LINE>As deepe as to the Lungs? Who does me this?</LINE>
<LINE>Ha? Why I &#383;hould take it: for it cannot be,</LINE>
<LINE>But I am Pigeon-Liuer&#8217;d, and lacke Gall</LINE>
<LINE>To make Oppre&#383;&#383;ion bitter, or ere this,</LINE>
<LINE>I &#383;hould haue fatted all the Region Kites</LINE>
<LINE>With this Slaues Offall, bloudy: a Bawdy villaine,</LINE>
<LINE>Remorsele&#383;&#383;e, Treacherous, Letcherous, kindles villaine!</LINE>
<LINE>Oh Vengeance!</LINE>
<LINE>Who? What an A&#383;&#383;e am I? I &#383;ure, this is mo&#8217;t braue,</LINE>
<LINE>That I, the Sonne of the Deere murthered,</LINE>
<LINE>Prompted to my Reuenge by Heauen, and Hell,</LINE>
<LINE>Must (like a Whore) vnpacke my heart with words,</LINE>
<LINE>And fall a Cursing like a very Drab.</LINE>
<LINE>A Scullion? Fye vpon't: Foh. About my Braine.</LINE>
<LINE>I haue heard, that guilty Creatures &#383;itting at a Play,</LINE>
<LINE>Haue by the very cunning of the Sc&#339;ne,</LINE>
<LINE>Bene &#383;trooke &#383;o to the &#383;oule, that presently</LINE>
<LINE>They haue proclaim&#8217;d their Malefactions.</LINE>
<LINE>For Murther, though it haue no tongue, will &#383;peake</LINE>
<LINE>With mo&#8217;t myraculous Organ. Ile haue these Players,</LINE>
<LINE>Play &#383;omething like the murder of my Father,</LINE>
<LINE>Before mine Vnkle. Ile obserue his lookes,</LINE>
<LINE>Ile rent him to the quicke: If he but blench</LINE>
<LINE>I know my course. The Spirit that I haue &#383;eene</LINE>
<LINE>May be the Diuell, and the Diuel hath power</LINE>
<LINE>T' a&#383;&#383;ume a pleasing &#383;hape, yea and perhaps</LINE>
<LINE>Out of my Weakne&#383;&#383;e, and my Melancholly,</LINE>
<LINE>As he is very potent with &#383;uch Spirits,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Ham.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To be, or not to be, that is the Question:</LINE>
<LINE>Whether &#8216;tis Nobler in the minde to &#383;uffer</LINE>
<LINE>The Slings and Arrowes of outragious Fortune,</LINE>
<LINE>Or to take Armes against a Sea of troubles,</LINE>
<LINE>And by opposing end them: to dye, to &#383;leepe</LINE>
<LINE>No more; and by a &#383;leepe, to &#383;ay we end</LINE>
<LINE>The Heart-ake, and the thousand Naturall &#383;hockes</LINE>
<LINE>That Flesh is heyre too? &#8216;Tis a consummation</LINE>
<LINE>Deuoutly to be wish&#8217;d. To dye to &#383;leepe,</LINE>
<LINE>To &#383;leepe, perchance to Dreame; I, there's the rub,</LINE>
<LINE>For in that &#383;leepe of death, what dreames may come,</LINE>
<LINE>When we haue &#383;huffel&#8217;d off this mortall coile,</LINE>
<LINE>Must giue vs pawse. There's the respect</LINE>
<LINE>That makes Calamity of &#383;o long life:</LINE>
<LINE>For who would beare the Whips and Scornes of time,</LINE>
<LINE>The Oppre&#383;&#383;ors wrong, the poore mans Contumely,</LINE>
<LINE>The pangs of dispriz&#8217;d Loue, the Lawes delay,</LINE>
<LINE>The insolence of Office, and the Spurnes</LINE>
<LINE>That patient merit of the vnworthy takes,</LINE>
<LINE>When he himselfe might his Quietus make</LINE>
<LINE>With a bare Bodkin? Who would these Fardles beare</LINE>
<LINE>To grunt and &#383;weat vnder a weary life,</LINE>
<LINE>But that the dread of &#383;omething after death,</LINE>
<LINE>The vndiscouered Countrey, from whose Borne</LINE>
<LINE>No Traueller returnes, Puzels the will,</LINE>
<LINE>And makes vs rather beare those illes we haue,</LINE>
<LINE>Then flye to others that we know not of.</LINE>
<LINE>Thus Conscience does make Cowards of vs all,</LINE>
<LINE>And thus the Natiue hew of Resolution</LINE>
<LINE>Is &#383;icklied o&#8217;re, with the pale cast of Thought,</LINE>
<LINE>And enterprizes of great pith and moment,</LINE>
<LINE>With this regard their Currants turne away,</LINE>
<LINE>And loose the name of Action. Soft you now,</LINE>
<LINE>The faire Ophelia? Nimph, in thy Orizons</LINE>

<SPEAKER>King.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do beleeue you. Think what now you &#383;peak:</LINE>

<LINE>Purpose is but the &#383;laue to Memorie,</LINE>
<LINE>Of violent Birth, but poore validitie:</LINE>
<LINE>Which now like Fruite vnripe &#383;tickes on the Tree,</LINE>

<LINE>Mo&#8217;t nece&#383;&#383;ary &#8216;tis, that we forget</LINE>

<LINE>The great man downe, you marke his fauourites flies,</LINE>

<LINE>Our Willes and Fates do &#383;o contrary run,</LINE>

<LINE>Though inclination be as &#383;harpe as will:</LINE>
<LINE>My &#383;tronger guilt, defeats my &#383;trong intent,</LINE>
<LINE>And like a man to double busine&#383;&#383;e bound,</LINE>
<LINE>I &#383;tand in pause where I &#383;hall first begin,</LINE>

<LINE>Were thicker then it &#383;elfe with Brothers blood,</LINE>
<LINE>Is there not Raine enough in the &#383;weet Heauens</LINE>
<LINE>To wash it white as Snow? Whereto &#383;erues mercy,</LINE>
<LINE>But to confront the visage of Offence?</LINE>
<LINE>And what&#8217;s in Prayer, but this two-fold force,</LINE>
<LINE>To be fore-stalled ere we come to fall,</LINE>
<LINE>Or pardon&#8217;d being downe? Then Ile looke vp,</LINE>
<LINE>My fault is past. But oh, what forme of Prayer</LINE>
<LINE>Can &#383;erue my turne? Forgiue me my foule Murther:</LINE>
<LINE>That cannot be, &#383;ince I am &#383;till po&#383;&#383;est</LINE>
<LINE>Of those effects for which I did the Murther.</LINE>
<LINE>My Crowne, mine owne Ambition, and my Queene:</LINE>
<LINE>May one be pardon&#8217;d, and retaine th&#8217; offence?</LINE>
<LINE>In the corrupted currants of this world,</LINE>
<LINE>Offences gilded hand may &#383;houe by Iustice,</LINE>
<LINE>And oft &#8216;tis &#383;eene, the wicked prize it &#383;elfe</LINE>
<LINE>Buyes out the Law; but &#8216;tis not &#383;o aboue,</LINE>

<LINE>In his true Nature, and we our &#383;elues compell&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>Euen to the teeth and forehead of our faults,</LINE>
<LINE>To giue in euidence. What then? What rests?</LINE>
<LINE>Try what Repentance can. What can it not?</LINE>
<LINE>Yet what can it, when one cannot repent?</LINE>
<LINE>Oh wretched &#383;tate! Oh bosome, blacke as death!</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>King.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now must your conscience my acquittance &#383;eal,</LINE>
<LINE>And you must put me in your heart for Friend,</LINE>
<LINE>Sith you haue heard, and with a knowing eare,</LINE>
<LINE>That he which hath your Noble Father &#383;laine,</LINE>
<LINE>Pursued my life.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Laer.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It well appeares. But tell me,</LINE>
<LINE>Why you proceeded not against these feates,</LINE>
<LINE>So crimefull, and &#383;o Capitall in Nature,</LINE>
<LINE>As by your Safety, Wisedome, all things else,</LINE>
<LINE>You mainly were &#383;tirr&#8217;d vp?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>King.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O for two &#383;peciall Reasons,</LINE>
<LINE>Which may to you (perhaps) &#383;eeme much vnsinnowed,</LINE>
<LINE>And yet to me they are &#383;trong. The Queen his Mother,</LINE>
<LINE>Liues almost by his lookes: and for my &#383;elfe,</LINE>
<LINE>My Vertue or my Plague, be it either which,</LINE>
<LINE>She's &#383;o coniunctiue to my life, and &#383;oule;</LINE>
<LINE>That as the Starre moues not but in his Sphere,</LINE>
<LINE>I could not but by her. The other Motiue,</LINE>
<LINE>Why to a publike count I might not go,</LINE>
<LINE>Is the great loue the generall gender beare him,</LINE>
<LINE>Who dipping all his Faults in their affection,</LINE>
<LINE>Would like the Spring that turneth Wood to Stone,</LINE>
<LINE>Conuert his Gyues to Graces. So that my Arrowes</LINE>
<LINE>Too &#383;lightly timbred for &#383;o loud a Winde,</LINE>
<LINE>Would haue reuerted to my Bow againe,</LINE>
<LINE>And not where I had arm&#8217;d them.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Laer.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And &#383;o haue I a Noble Father lo&#383;t,</LINE>
<LINE>A Sister driuen into desperate tearmes,</LINE>
<LINE>Who was (if praises may go backe againe)</LINE>
<LINE>Stood Challenger on mount of all the Age</LINE>
<LINE>For her perfections. But my reuenge will come.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>That we are made of &#383;tuffe, &#383;o flat, and dull,</LINE>

<LINE>And thinke it pastime. You &#383;hortly &#383;hall heare more,</LINE>
<LINE>I lou&#8217;d your Father, and we loue our Selfe,</LINE>

<LINE>Rapiers and Poniards, with their a&#383;&#383;ignes, as Girdle,</LINE>
<LINE>Hangers or &#383;o: three of the Carriages infaith are very</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<LINE>The Carriages Sir, are the hangers.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Ham.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The phrase would bee more Germaine to the</LINE>

<LINE>against &#383;ixe French Swords: their A&#383;&#383;ignes, and three</LINE>
