<LINE>They met me in the day of &#383;ucce&#383;&#383;e: and I haue learn&#8217;d by the perfect'st report, they haue more in them, then mortall knowledge. When I burnt in desire to question them further, they made themselues Ayre, into which they vanish&#8217;d. Whiles I &#383;tood rapt in the wonder of it, came Mi&#383;&#383;iues from the King, who all-hail&#8217;d me Thane of Cawdor, by which Title before, these weyward Sisters &#383;aluted me, and referr&#8217;d me to the comming on of time, with haile King that &#383;halt be. This haue I thought good to deliuer thee (my dearest Partner of Greatne&#383;&#383;e) that thou might'st not loose the dues of reioycing by being ignorant of what Greatne&#383;&#383;e is promis&#8217;d thee. Lay it to thy heart and farewell. Glamys thou art, and Cawdor, and &#383;halt be What thou art promis&#8217;d: yet doe I feare thy Nature, It is too full o'th&#8217; Milke of humane kindne&#383;&#383;e, To catch the neerest way. Thou would'st be great, Art not without Ambition, but without The illne&#383;&#383;e &#383;hould attend it. What thou would'st highly, That would'st thou holily: would'st not play false, And yet would'st wrongly winne. Thould'st haue, great Glamys, that which cryes, Thus thou must doe, if thou haue it; And that which rather thou do'st feare to doe, Then wishest &#383;hould be vndone. High thee hither, That I may powre my Spirits in thine Eare, And chastise with the valour of my Tongue All that impeides thee from the Golden Round, Which Fate and Metaphysicall ayde doth &#383;eeme To haue thee crown&#8217;d withall. <STAGEDIR>Enter Me&#383;&#383;enger.</STAGEDIR> What is your tidings?</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Port.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, Sir, Nose-painting, Sleepe, and Vrine. Lecherie, Sir, it prouokes, and vnprouokes: it prouokes the desire, but it takes away the performance. Therefore much Drinke may be &#383;aid to be an Equiuocator with Le-cherie: it makes him, and it marres him; it &#383;ets him on, and it takes him off; it perswades him, and dis-heartens him; makes him &#383;tand too, and not &#383;tand too: in conclu-sion, equiuocates him in a &#383;leepe, and giuing him the Lye, leaues him.</LINE>

<LINE>That were the Slaues of drinke, and thralles of &#383;leepe?</LINE>
<LINE>Was not that Nobly done? I, and wisely too:</LINE>
