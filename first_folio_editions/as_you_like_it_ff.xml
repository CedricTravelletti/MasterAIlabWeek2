<LINE>pleas&#8217;d me, complexions that lik&#8217;d me, and breaths that</LINE>
<LINE>I defi&#8217;de not: And I am &#383;ure, as many as haue good</LINE>
<LINE>beards, or good faces, or &#383;weet breaths, will for my kind</LINE>
<LINE>offer, when I make curt&#8217;&#383;ie, bid me farewell. </LINE>
