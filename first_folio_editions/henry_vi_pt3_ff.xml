<line>My Father was as thou art, Duke of Yorke,</line>
<line>Thy Grandfather Roger Mortimer, Earle of March.</line>

<line>When I was crown&#8217;d, I was but nine moneths old.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Rich.</speaker>
<line>You are old enough now,</line>
<line>And yet me thinkes you loose:</line>

<line>Wherein my Grandsire and my Father &#383;at?</line>
<line>No: first &#383;hall Warre vnpeople this my Realme;</line>

<line>Henry the Fourth by Conquest got the Crowne.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Plant.</speaker>
<line>'Twas by Rebellion against his King.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<line>I know not what to &#383;ay, my Titles weake:</line>
<line>Tell me, may not a King adopt an Heire?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Plant.</speaker>
<line>What then?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<line>And if he may, then am I lawfull King:</line>
<line>For Richard, in the view of many Lords,</line>
<line>Resign&#8217;d the Crowne to Henry the Fourth,</line>
<line>Whose Heire my Father was, and I am his.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Plant.</speaker>
<line>He rose against him, being his Soueraigne,</line>
<line>And made him to resigne his Crowne perforce.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Warw.</speaker>
<line>Suppose, my Lords, he did it vnconstrayn&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Thinke you 'twere preiudiciall to his Crowne?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Exet.</speaker>
<line>No: for he could not &#383;o resigne his Crowne,</line>
<line>But that the next Heire &#383;hould &#383;ucceed and reigne.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<line>Art thou against vs, Duke of Exeter?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Exet.</speaker>
<line>His is the right, and therefore pardon me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Plant.</speaker>
<line>Why whisper you, my Lords, and an&#383;wer not?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Exet.</speaker>
<line>My Conscience tells me he is lawfull King.</line>
</speech>

<speech>

<line>Plantagenet, for all the Clayme thou lay'st,</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Northumb.</speaker>
<line>Thou art deceiu&#8217;d:</line>
<line>&#8216;Tis not thy Southerne power</line>
<line>Of E&#383;&#383;ex, Norfolke, Suffolke, nor of Kent,</line>
<line>Which makes thee thus presumptuous and prowd,</line>
<line>Can &#383;et the Duke vp in despight of me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Clifford.</speaker>
<line>King Henry, be thy Title right or wrong,</line>

<line>May that ground gape, and &#383;wallow me aliue,</line>
<line>Where I &#383;hall kneele to him that &#383;lew my Father.</line>

<line>To entayle him and his Heires vnto the Crowne,</line>
<line>What is it, but to make thy Sepulcher,</line>

<line>Warwick is Chancelor, and the Lord of Callice,</line>
<line>Sterne Falconbridge commands the Narrow Seas,</line>
<line>The Duke is made Protector of the Realme,</line>
<line>And yet &#383;halt thou be &#383;afe? Such &#383;afetie findes</line>
<line>The trembling Lambe, inuironned with Wolues.</line>

<line>And &#383;eeing thou do'st, I here diuorce my &#383;elfe,</line>
<line>Both from thy Table Henry, and thy Bed,</line>

<speaker>Henry.</speaker>
<line>Poore Queene,</line>
<line>How loue to me, and to her Sonne,</line>
<line>Hath made her breake out into termes of Rage.</line>
<line>Reueng&#8217;d may &#383;he be on that hatefull Duke,</line>
<line>Whose haughtie &#383;pirit, winged with desire,</line>
<line>Will cost my Crowne, and like an emptie Eagle,</line>
<line>Tyre on the flesh of me, and of my Sonne.</line>
<line>The lo&#383;&#383;e of those three Lords torments my heart:</line>
<line>Ile write vnto them, and entreat them faire;</line>
<line>Come Cousin, you &#383;hall be the Me&#383;&#383;enger.</line>

<stagedir>Enter the Duke of Yorke.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>Yorke.</speaker>
<line>Why how now Sonnes, and Brother, at a &#383;trife?</line>
<line>What is your Quarrell? how began it first?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Edward.</speaker>
<line>No Quarrell, but a &#383;light Contention.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Yorke.</speaker>
<line>About what?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Rich.</speaker>
<line>About that which concernes your Grace and vs,</line>
<line>The Crowne of England, Father, which is yours.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Yorke.</speaker>
<line>Mine Boy? not till King Henry be dead.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Richard.</speaker>
<line>Your Right depends not on his life, or death.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Edward.</speaker>
<line>Now you are Heire, therefore enioy it now:</line>
<line>By giuing the House of Lancaster leaue to breathe,</line>
<line>It will out-runne you, Father, in the end.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Yorke.</speaker>
<line>I tooke an Oath, that hee &#383;hould quietly reigne.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Edward.</speaker>
<line>But for a Kingdome any Oath may be broken:</line>
<line>I would breake a thousand Oathes, to reigne one yeere.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Richard.</speaker>
<line>No: God forbid your Grace &#383;hould be for-sworne.</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Yorke.</speaker>
<line>Thou canst not, Sonne: it is impo&#383;&#383;ible.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Richard.</speaker>
<line>An Oath is of no moment, being not tooke</line>
<line>Before a true and lawfull Magistrate,</line>
<line>That hath authoritie ouer him that &#383;weares.</line>
<line>Henry had none, but did vsurpe the place.</line>
<line>Then &#383;eeing 'twas he that made you to depose,</line>
<line>Your Oath, my Lord, is vaine and friuolous.</line>
<line>Therefore to Armes: and Father doe but thinke,</line>
<line>How &#383;weet a thing it is to weare a Crowne,</line>
<line>Within whose Circuit is Elizium,</line>
<line>And all that P&#339;ts faine of Bli&#383;&#383;e and Ioy.</line>
<line>Why doe we linger thus? I cannot rest,</line>

Thou Richard &#383;halt to the Duke of Norfolke, And tell him priuily of our intent. You Edward &#383;hall vnto my Lord Cobham, With whom the Kentishmen will willingly rise. In them I trust: for they are Souldiors, Wittie, courteous, liberall, full of &#383;pirit. While you are thus imploy&#8217;d, what resteth more? But that I &#383;eeke occasion how to rise, And yet the King not priuie to my Drift, Nor any of the House of Lancaster. <stagedir>Enter Gabriel.</stagedir> But &#383;tay, what Newes?

<line>Many a Battaile haue I wonne in France,</line>

<line>And &#383;o he comes, to rend his Limbes asunder.</line>
<line>Ah gentle Clifford, kill me with thy Sword,</line>

<speech>

<line>In vaine thou &#383;peak'st, poore Boy:</line>

<line>Where thy words &#383;hould enter.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Rutland.</speaker>
<line>Then let my Fathers blood open it againe,</line>
<line>He is a man, and Clifford cope with him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Clifford.</speaker>
<line>Had I thy Brethren here, their liues and thine</line>
<line>Were not reuenge &#383;ufficient for me:</line>
<line>No, if I digg&#8217;d vp thy fore-fathers Graues,</line>
<line>And hung their rotten Coffins vp in Chaynes,</line>
<line>It could not &#383;lake mine ire, nor ease my heart.</line>
<line>The &#383;ight of any of the House of Yorke,</line>
<line>Is as a furie to torment my Soule:</line>
<line>And till I root out their accursed Line,</line>
<line>And leaue not one aliue, I liue in Hell.</line>
<line>Therefore&#8212;</line>

<speech>

<speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Rutland.</speaker>
<line>I neuer did thee harme: why wilt thou &#383;lay me?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Clifford.</speaker>
<line>Thy Father hath.</line>

<line>But 'twas ere I was borne.</line>
<line>Thou hast one Sonne, for his &#383;ake pitty me,</line>
<line>Least in reuenge thereof, &#383;ith God is iust,</line>
<line>He be as miserably &#383;laine as I.</line>
<line>Ah, let me liue in Prison all my dayes,</line>
<line>And when I giue occasion of offence,</line>
<line>Then let me dye, for now thou hast no cause.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Clifford.</speaker>
<line>No cause? thy Father &#383;lew my Father: there-fore dye.</line>

<line>Plantagenet, I come Plantagenet:</line>
<line>And this thy Sonnes blood cleauing to my Blade,</line>

<stagedir>Exit.</stagedir>

<stagedir>Alarum. Enter Richard, Duke of Yorke.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>Yorke.</speaker>
<line>The Army of the Queene hath got the field: My Vnckles both are &#383;laine, in rescuing me; And all my followers, to the eager f&#339; Turne back, and flye, like Ships before the Winde, Or Lambes pursu&#8217;d by hunger-starued Wolues. My Sonnes, God knowes what hath bechanced them: But this I know, they haue demean&#8217;d themselues Like men borne to Renowne, by Life or Death. Three times did Richard make a Lane to me, And thrice cry&#8217;de, Courage Father, fight it out: And full as oft came Edward to my &#383;ide, With Purple Faulchion, painted to the Hilt, In blood of those that had encountred him: And when the hardyest Warriors did retyre, Richard cry&#8217;de, Charge, and giue no foot of ground, And cry&#8217;de, A Crowne, or else a glorious Tombe, A Scepter, or an Earthly Sepulchre. With this we charg&#8217;d againe: but out alas, We bodg&#8217;d againe, as I haue &#383;eene a Swan With bootle&#383;&#383;e labour &#383;wimme against the Tyde, And &#383;pend her &#383;trength with ouer-matching Waues. <stagedir>A &#383;hort Alarum within.</stagedir> Ah hearke, the fatall followers doe pursue, And I am faint, and cannot flye their furie: And were I &#383;trong, I would not &#383;hunne their furie, The Sands are numbred, that makes vp my Life, Here must I &#383;tay, and here my Life must end. <stagedir>Enter the Queene, Clifford, Northumberland, the young Prince, and Souldiers</stagedir> Come bloody Clifford, rough Northumberland, I dare your quenchle&#383;&#383;e furie to more rage: I am your Butt, and I abide your Shot.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Northumb.</speaker>
<line>Yeeld to our mercy, proud Plantagenet.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Clifford.</speaker>
<line>I, to &#383;uch mercy, as his ruthle&#383;&#383;e Arme</line>
<line>With downe-right payment, &#383;hew&#8217;d vnto my Father.</line>
<line>Now Phaeton hath tumbled from his Carre,</line>
<line>And made an Euening at the Noone-tide Prick.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Yorke.</speaker>
<line>My ashes, as the Ph&#339;nix, may bring forth</line>
<line>A Bird, that will reuenge vpon you all:</line>
<line>And in that hope, I throw mine eyes to Heauen,</line>
<line>Scorning what ere you can afflict me with.</line>
<line>Why come you not? what, multitudes, and feare?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Cliff.</speaker>
<line>So Cowards fight, when they can flye no further,</line>
<line>So Doues doe peck the Faulcons piercing Tallons,</line>
<line>So desperate Theeues, all hopele&#383;&#383;e of their Liues,</line>
<line>Breathe out Inuectiues 'gainst the Officers.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Yorke.</speaker>
<line>Oh Clifford, but bethinke thee once againe,</line>
<line>And in thy thought ore-run my former time:</line>
<line>And if thou canst, for blushing, view this face,</line>
<line>And bite thy tongue, that &#383;landers him with Cowardice,</line>
<line>Whose frowne hath made thee faint and flye ere this.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Clifford.</speaker>
<line>I will not bandie with thee word for word,</line>
<line>But buckler with thee blowes twice two for one.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Queene.</speaker>
<line>Hold valiant Clifford, for a thousand causes</line>
<line>I would prolong a while the Traytors Life:</line>
<line>Wrath makes him deafe; &#383;peake thou Northumberland.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Northumb.</speaker>
<line>Hold Clifford, doe not honor him &#383;o much,</line>
<line>To prick thy finger, though to wound his heart.</line>
<line>What valour were it, when a Curre doth grinne,</line>
<line>For one to thrust his Hand betweene his Teeth,</line>
<line>When he might &#383;purne him with his Foot away?</line>
<line>It is Warres prize, to take all Vantages,</line>
<line>And tenne to one, is no impeach of Valour.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Clifford.</speaker>
<line>I, I, &#383;o &#383;triues the Woodcocke with the</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Northumb.</speaker>
<line>What would your Grace haue done vnto him now?</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Queene.</speaker>
<line>Braue Warriors, Clifford and Northumberland,</line>
<line>Come make him &#383;tand vpon this Mole-hill here,</line>
<line>That raught at Mountaines with out-stretched Armes,</line>
<line>Yet parted but the &#383;hadow with his Hand.</line>
<line>What, was it you that would be Englands King?</line>
<line>Was't you that reuell&#8217;d in our Parliament,</line>
<line>And made a Preachment of your high Descent?</line>
<line>Where are your Me&#383;&#383;e of Sonnes, to back you now?</line>
<line>The wanton Edward, and the lustie George?</line>
<line>And where's that valiant Crook-back Prodigie,</line>
<line>Dickie, your Boy, that with his grumbling voyce</line>
<line>Was wont to cheare his Dad in Mutinies?</line>
<line>Or with the rest, where is your Darling, Rutland?</line>
<line>Looke Yorke, I &#383;tayn&#8217;d this Napkin with the blood</line>
<line>That valiant Clifford, with his Rapiers point,</line>
<line>Made i&#383;&#383;ue from the Bosome of the Boy:</line>
<line>And if thine eyes can water for his death,</line>
<line>I giue thee this to drie thy Cheekes withall.</line>
<line>Alas poore Yorke, but that I hate thee deadly,</line>
<line>I &#383;hould lament thy miserable &#383;tate.</line>
<line>I prythee grieue, to make me merry, Yorke.</line>
<line>What, hath thy fierie heart &#383;o parcht thine entrayles,</line>
<line>That not a Teare can fall, for Rutlands death?</line>
<line>Why art thou patient, man? thou &#383;hould'st be mad:</line>
<line>And I, to make thee mad, doe mock thee thus.</line>
<line>Stampe, raue, and fret, that I may &#383;ing and dance.</line>
<line>Thou would'st be fee&#8217;d, I &#383;ee, to make me &#383;port:</line>
<line>Yorke cannot &#383;peake, vnle&#383;&#383;e he weare a Crowne.</line>
<line>A Crowne for Yorke; and Lords, bow lowe to him:</line>
<line>Hold you his hands, whilest I doe &#383;et it on.</line>
<line>I marry Sir, now lookes he like a King:</line>
<line>I, this is he that tooke King Henries Chaire,</line>
<line>And this is he was his adopted Heire.</line>
<line>But how is it, that great Plantagenet</line>
<line>Is crown&#8217;d &#383;o &#383;oone, and broke his &#383;olemne Oath?</line>
<line>As I bethinke me, you &#383;hould not be King,</line>
<line>Till our King Henry had &#383;hooke hands with Death.</line>
<line>And will you pale your head in Henries Glory,</line>
<line>And rob his Temples of the Diademe,</line>
<line>Now in his Life, against your holy Oath?</line>
<line>Oh &#8216;tis a fault too too vnpardonable.</line>
<line>Off with the Crowne; and with the Crowne, his Head,</line>
<line>And whilest we breathe, take time to doe him dead.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Clifford.</speaker>
<line>That is my Office, for my Fathers &#383;ake.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Queene.</speaker>
<line>Nay &#383;tay, let's heare the Orizons hee makes.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Yorke.</speaker>
<line>Shee-Wolfe of France,</line>
<line>But worse then Wolues of France,</line>
<line>Whose Tongue more poysons then the Adders Tooth:</line>
<line>How ill-beseeming is it in thy Sex,</line>
<line>To triumph like an Amazonian Trull,</line>
<line>Vpon their W&#339;s, whom Fortune captiuates?</line>
<line>But that thy Face is Vizard-like, vnchanging,</line>
<line>Made impudent with vse of euill deedes.</line>
<line>I would a&#383;&#383;ay, prowd Queene, to make thee blush.</line>
<line>To tell thee whence thou cam'st, of whom deriu&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Were &#383;hame enough, to &#383;hame thee,</line>
<line>Wert thou not &#383;hamele&#383;&#383;e.</line>
<line>Thy Father beares the type of King of Naples,</line>
<line>Of both the Sicils, and Ierusalem,</line>
<line>Yet not &#383;o wealthie as an English Yeoman.</line>
<line>Hath that poore Monarch taught thee to insult?</line>
<line>It needes not, nor it bootes thee not, prowd Queene,</line>
<line>Vnle&#383;&#383;e the Adage must be verify&#8217;d,</line>
<line>That Beggers mounted, runne their Horse to death.</line>
<line>&#8216;Tis Beautie that doth oft make Women prowd,</line>
<line>But God he knowes, thy &#383;hare thereof is &#383;mall.</line>
<line>&#8216;Tis Vertue, that doth make them mo&#8217;t admir&#8217;d,</line>
<line>The contrary, doth make thee wondred at.</line>
<line>&#8216;Tis Gouernment that makes them &#383;eeme Diuine,</line>
<line>The want thereof, makes thee abhominable.</line>
<line>Thou art as opposite to euery good,</line>
<line>As the Antipodes are vnto vs,</line>
<line>Or as the South to the Septentrion.</line>
<line>Oh Tygres Heart, wrapt in a Womans Hide,</line>
<line>How could'st thou drayne the Life-blood of the Child,</line>
<line>To bid the Father wipe his eyes withall,</line>
<line>And yet be &#383;eene to beare a Womans face?</line>
<line>Women are &#383;oft, milde, pittifull, and flexible;</line>
<line>Thou, &#383;terne, obdurate, flintie, rough, remorsele&#383;&#383;e.</line>
<line>Bidst thou me rage? why now thou hast thy wish.</line>
<line>Would'st haue me weepe? why now thou hast thy will.</line>
<line>For raging Wind blowes vp ince&#383;&#383;ant &#383;howers,</line>
<line>And when the Rage allayes, the Raine begins.</line>
<line>These Teares are my &#383;weet Rutlands Obsequies,</line>
<line>And euery drop cryes vengeance for his death,</line>
<line>'Gainst thee fell Clifford, and thee false French-woman.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Northumb.</speaker>
<line>Beshrew me, but his pa&#383;&#383;ions moues me &#383;o,</line>
<line>That hardly can I check my eyes from Teares.</line>
</speech>

<speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Edward.</speaker>
<line>I wonder how our Princely Father &#383;cap't:</line>
<line>Or whether he be &#383;cap't away, or no,</line>
<line>From Cliffords and Northumberlands pursuit?</line>
<line>Had he been ta'ne, we &#383;hould haue heard the newes;</line>
<line>Had he beene &#383;laine, we &#383;hould haue heard the newes:</line>
<line>Or had he &#383;cap't, me thinkes we &#383;hould haue heard</line>
<line>The happy tidings of his good escape.</line>
<line>How fares my Brother? why is he &#383;o &#383;ad?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Richard.</speaker>
<line>I cannot ioy, vntill I be resolu&#8217;d</line>
<line>Where our right valiant Father is become.</line>
<line>I &#383;aw him in the Battaile range about,</line>
<line>And watcht him how he &#383;ingled Clifford forth.</line>
<line>Me thought he bore him in the thickest troupe,</line>
<line>As doth a Lyon in a Heard of Neat,</line>
<line>Or as a Beare encompa&#383;&#383;&#8217;d round with Dogges:</line>
<line>Who hauing pincht a few, and made them cry,</line>
<line>The rest &#383;tand all aloofe, and barke at him.</line>
<line>So far&#8217;d our Father with his Enemies,</line>
<line>So fled his Enemies my Warlike Father:</line>
<line>Me thinkes &#8216;tis prize enough to be his Sonne.</line>
<line>See how the Morning opes her golden Gates,</line>
<line>And takes her farwell of the glorious Sunne.</line>
<line>How well resembles it the prime of Youth,</line>
<line>Trimm&#8217;d like a Yonker, prauncing to his Loue?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Ed.</speaker>
<line>Dazle mine eyes, or doe I &#383;ee three Sunnes?</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Rich.</speaker>
<line>Three glorious Sunnes, each one a perfect Sunne,</line>
<line>Not &#383;eperated with the racking Clouds,</line>
<line>But &#383;euer&#8217;d in a pale cleare-shining Skye.</line>
<line>See, &#383;ee, they ioyne, embrace, and &#383;eeme to ki&#383;&#383;e,</line>
<line>As if they vow&#8217;d &#383;ome League inuiolable.</line>
<line>Now are they but one Lampe, one Light, one Sunne:</line>
<line>In this, the Heauen figures &#383;ome euent.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Edward.</speaker>
<line>&#8216;Tis wondrous &#383;trange,</line>
<line>The like yet neuer heard of.</line>
<line>I thinke it cites vs (Brother) to the field,</line>
<line>That wee, the Sonnes of braue Plantagenet,</line>
<line>Each one alreadie blazing by our meedes,</line>
<line>Should notwithstanding ioyne our Lights together,</line>

</speech>

<speech>

<line>Oh &#383;peake no more, for I haue heard too much.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Me&#383;&#383;.</speaker>
<line>Enuironed he was with many f&#339;s,</line>
<line>And &#383;tood against them, as the hope of Troy</line>
<line>Against the Greekes, that would haue entred Troy.</line>
<line>But Hercules himselfe must yeeld to oddes:</line>
<line>And many &#383;troakes, though with a little Axe,</line>
<line>Hewes downe and fells the hardest-tymber&#8217;d Oake.</line>
<line>By many hands your Father was &#383;ubdu&#8217;d,</line>
<line>But onely &#383;laught'red by the irefull Arme</line>
<line>Of vn-relenting Clifford, and the Queene:</line>
<line>Who crown&#8217;d the gracious Duke in high despight,</line>
<line>Laugh&#8217;d in his face: and when with griefe he wept,</line>
<line>The ruthle&#383;&#383;e Queene gaue him, to dry his Cheekes,</line>
<line>A Napkin, &#383;teeped in the harmele&#383;&#383;e blood</line>
<line>Of &#383;weet young Rutland, by rough Clifford &#383;laine:</line>
<line>And after many &#383;cornes, many foule taunts,</line>
<line>They tooke his Head, and on the Gates of Yorke</line>
<line>They &#383;et the &#383;ame, and there it doth remaine,</line>
<line>The &#383;addest &#383;pectacle that ere I view&#8217;d.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Edward.</speaker>
<line>Sweet Duke of Yorke, our Prop to leane vpon,</line>
<line>Now thou art gone, wee haue no Staffe, no Stay.</line>
<line>Oh Clifford, boyst'rous Clifford, thou hast &#383;laine</line>
<line>The flowre of Europe, for his Cheualrie,</line>
<line>And trecherously hast thou vanquisht him,</line>
<line>For hand to hand he would haue vanquisht thee.</line>
<line>Now my Soules Pallace is become a Prison:</line>
<line>Ah, would &#383;he breake from hence, that this my body</line>
<line>Might in the ground be closed vp in rest:</line>
<line>For neuer henceforth &#383;hall I ioy againe:</line>

<line>Scarse &#383;erues to quench my Furnace-burning hart:</line>

<line>For &#383;elfe-&#383;ame winde that I &#383;hould &#383;peake withall,</line>
<line>Is kindling coales that fires all my brest,</line>

<speaker>Warwick.</speaker>
<line>How now faire Lords? What faire? What newes abroad?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Rich.</speaker>
<line>Great Lord of Warwicke, if we &#383;hould recompt</line>
<line>Our balefull newes, and at each words deliuerance</line>
<line>Stab Poniards in our flesh, till all were told,</line>
<line>The words would adde more anguish then the wounds.</line>
<line>O valiant Lord, the Duke of Yorke is &#383;laine.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Edw.</speaker>
<line>O Warwicke, Warwicke, that Plantagenet</line>
<line>Which held thee deerely, as his Soules Redemption,</line>
<line>Is by the &#383;terne Lord Clifford done to death.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>War.</speaker>
<line>Ten dayes ago, I drown&#8217;d these newes in teares.</line>
<line>And now to adde more measure to your w&#339;s,</line>
<line>I come to tell you things &#383;ith then befalne.</line>
<line>After the bloody Fray at Wakefield fought,</line>
<line>Where your braue Father breath&#8217;d his latest gaspe,</line>
<line>Tydings, as &#383;wiftly as the Postes could runne,</line>
<line>Were brought me of your Lo&#383;&#383;e, and his Depart.</line>
<line>I then in London, keeper of the King,</line>
<line>Muster&#8217;d my Soldiers, gathered flockes of Friends,</line>
<line>Marcht toward S[aint]. Albons, to intercept the Queene,</line>
<line>Bearing the King in my behalfe along:</line>
<line>For by my Scouts, I was aduertised</line>
<line>That &#383;he was comming with a full intent</line>
<line>To dash our late Decree in Parliament,</line>
<line>Touching King Henries Oath, and your Succe&#383;&#383;ion:</line>
<line>Short Tale to make, we at S[aint]. Albons met,</line>
<line>Our Battailes ioyn&#8217;d, and both &#383;ides fiercely fought:</line>
<line>But whether 'twas the coldne&#383;&#383;e of the King,</line>
<line>Who look&#8217;d full gently on his warlike Queene,</line>
<line>That robb&#8217;d my Soldiers of their heated Spleene.</line>
<line>Or whether 'twas report of her &#383;ucce&#383;&#383;e,</line>
<line>Or more then common feare of Cliffords Rigour,</line>
<line>Who thunders to his Captiues, Blood and Death,</line>
<line>I cannot iudge: but to conclude with truth,</line>
<line>Their Weapons like to Lightning, came and went:</line>
<line>Our Souldiers like the Night-Owles lazie flight,</line>
<line>Or like a lazie Thresher with a Flaile,</line>
<line>Fell gently downe, as if they &#383;trucke their Friends.</line>
<line>I cheer&#8217;d them vp with iustice of our Cause,</line>
<line>With promise of high pay, and great Rewards:</line>
<line>But all in vaine, they had no heart to fight,</line>
<line>And we (in them) no hope to win the day,</line>
<line>So that we fled: the King vnto the Queene,</line>
<line>Lord George, your Brother, Norfolke, and my Selfe,</line>
<line>In haste, post haste, are come to ioyne with you:</line>
<line>For in the Marches heere we heard you were,</line>
<line>Making another Head, to fight againe.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Ed.</speaker>
<line>Where is the Duke of Norfolke, gentle Warwick?</line>
<line>And when came George from Burgundy to England?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>War.</speaker>
<line>Some &#383;ix miles off the Duke is with the Soldiers,</line>
<line>And for your Brother he was lately &#383;ent</line>
<line>From your kinde Aunt Dutche&#383;&#383;e of Burgundie,</line>
<line>With ayde of Souldiers to this needfull Warre.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Rich.</speaker>
<line>'Twas oddes belike, when valiant Warwick fled;</line>
<line>Oft haue I heard his praises in Pursuite,</line>
<line>But ne're till now, his Scandall of Retire.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>War.</speaker>
<line>Nor now my Scandall Richard, dost thou heare:</line>
<line>For thou &#383;halt know this &#383;trong right hand of mine,</line>
<line>Can plucke the Diadem from faint Henries head,</line>
<line>And wring the awefull Scepter from his Fist,</line>
<line>Were he as famous, and as bold in Warre,</line>
<line>As he is fam&#8217;d for Mildne&#383;&#383;e, Peace, and Prayer.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Rich.</speaker>
<line>I know it well Lord Warwick, blame me not,</line>
<line>&#8216;Tis loue I beare thy glories make me &#383;peake:</line>
<line>But in this troublous time, what&#8217;s to be done?</line>
<line>Shall we go throw away our Coates of Steele,</line>
<line>And wrap our bodies in blacke mourning Gownes,</line>
<line>Numb'ring our Aue-Maries with our Beads?</line>
<line>Or &#383;hall we on the Helmets of our F&#339;s</line>
<line>Tell our Deuotion with reuengefull Armes?</line>
<line>If for the last, &#383;ay I, and to it Lords.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>War.</speaker>
<line>Why therefore Warwick came to &#383;eek you out,</line>
<line>And therefore comes my Brother Mountague:</line>
<line>Attend me Lords, the proud insulting Queene,</line>
<line>With Clifford, and the haught Northumberland,</line>
<line>And of their Feather, many moe proud Birds,</line>
<line>Haue wrought the easie-melting King, like Wax.</line>
<line>He &#383;wore consent to your Succe&#383;&#383;ion,</line>
<line>His Oath enrolled in the Parliament.</line>
<line>And now to London all the crew are gone,</line>
<line>To frustrate both his Oath, and what beside</line>
<line>May make against the house of Lancaster.</line>
<line>Their power (I thinke) is thirty thousand &#383;trong:</line>
<line>Now, if the helpe of Norfolke, and my &#383;elfe,</line>
<line>With all the Friends that thou braue Earle of March,</line>
<line>Among'st the louing Welshmen can'st procure,</line>
<line>Will but amount to fiue and twenty thousand,</line>
<line>Why Via, to London will we march,</line>
<line>And once againe, bestride our foaming Steeds,</line>
<line>And once againe cry Charge vpon our F&#339;s,</line>
<line>But neuer once againe turne backe and flye.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Rich.</speaker>
<line>I, now me thinks I heare great Warwick &#383;peak;</line>
<line>Ne're may he liue to &#383;ee a Sun-shine day,</line>
<line>That cries Retire, if Warwicke bid him &#383;tay.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Ed.</speaker>
<line>Lord Warwicke, on thy &#383;houlder will I leane,</line>
<line>And when thou failst (as God forbid the houre)</line>
<line>Must Edward fall, which perill heauen forefend.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>War.</speaker>
<line>No longer Earle of March, but Duke of Yorke:</line>
<line>The next degree, is Englands Royall Throne:</line>
<line>For King of England &#383;halt thou be proclaim&#8217;d</line>
<line>In euery Burrough as we pa&#383;&#383;e along,</line>
<line>And he that throwes not vp his cap for ioy,</line>
<line>Shall for the Fault make forfeit of his head.</line>
<line>King Edward, valiant Richard Mountague:</line>
<line>Stay we no longer, dreaming of Renowne.</line>
<line>But &#383;ound the Trumpets, and about our Taske.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Rich.</speaker>
<line>Then Clifford, were thy heart as hard as Steele,</line>
<line>As thou hast &#383;hewne it flintie by thy deeds,</line>
<line>I come to pierce it, or to giue thee mine.</line>

<line>Whose hand is that the Forrest Beare doth licke?</line>
<line>Not his that &#383;poyles her yong before her face.</line>
<line>Who &#383;capes the lurking Serpents mortall &#383;ting?</line>

<line>The &#383;mallest Worme will turne, being troden on,</line>

<line>Ambitious Yorke, did leuell at thy Crowne,</line>

<line>He but a Duke, would haue his Sonne a King,</line>
<line>And raise his i&#383;&#383;ue like a louing Sire.</line>
<line>Thou being a King, blest with a goodly &#383;onne,</line>
<line>Did'st yeeld consent to disinherit him:</line>
<line>Which argued thee a mo&#8217;t vnlouing Father.</line>
<line>Vnreasonable Creatures feed their young,</line>

<line>Yet in protection of their tender ones,</line>

<line>Which &#383;ometime they haue vs&#8217;d with fearfull flight,</line>
<line>Make warre with him that climb&#8217;d vnto their nest,</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Hen.</speaker>
<line>This battell fares like to the mornings Warre, When dying clouds contend, with growing light, What time the Shepheard blowing of his nailes, Can neither call it perfect day, nor night. Now &#383;wayes it this way, like a Mighty Sea, Forc&#8217;d by the Tide, to combat with the Winde: Now &#383;wayes it that way, like the &#383;elfe-&#383;ame Sea, Forc&#8217;d to retyre by furie of the Winde. Sometime, the Flood preuailes; and than the Winde: Now, one the better: then, another best; Both tugging to be Victors, brest to brest: Yet neither Conqueror, nor Conquered. So is the equall poise of this fell Warre. Heere on this Mole-hill will I &#383;it me downe, To whom God will, there be the Victorie: For Margaret my Queene, and Clifford too Haue chid me from the Battell: Swearing both, They prosper best of all when I am thence. Would I were dead, if Gods good will were &#383;o; For what is in this world, but Greefe and W&#339;. Oh God! me thinkes it were a happy life, To be no better then a homely Swaine, To &#383;it vpon a hill, as I do now, To carue out Dialls queintly, point by point, Thereby to &#383;ee the Minutes how they runne: How many makes the Houre full compleate, How many Houres brings about the Day, How many Dayes will finish vp the Yeare, How many Yeares, a Mortall man may liue. When this is knowne, then to diuide the Times: So many Houres, must I tend my Flocke; So many Houres, must I take my Rest: So many Houres, must I Contemplate: So many Houres, must I Sport my &#383;elfe: So many Dayes, my Ewes haue bene with yong: So many weekes, ere the poore Fooles will Eane: So many yeares, ere I &#383;hall &#383;heere the Fleece: So Minutes, Houres, Dayes, Monthes, and Yeares, Past ouer to the end they were created, Would bring white haires, vnto a Quiet graue. Ah! what a life were this? How &#383;weet? how louely? Giues not the Hawthorne bush a &#383;weeter &#383;hade To Shepheards, looking on their &#383;illy Sheepe, Then doth a rich Imbroider&#8217;d Canopie To Kings, that feare their Subiects treacherie? Oh yes, it doth; a thousand fold it doth. And to conclude, the Shepherds homely Curds, His cold thinne drinke out of his Leather Bottle, His wonted &#383;leepe, vnder a fresh trees &#383;hade, All which &#383;ecure, and &#383;weetly he enioyes, Is farre beyond a Princes Delicates: His Viands &#383;parkling in a Golden Cup, His bodie couched in a curious bed, When Care, Mistrust, and Treason waits on him.</line>

<line>Heere burnes my Candle out; I, heere it dies,</line>
<line>Which whiles it lasted, gaue King Henry light.</line>
<line>O Lancaster! I feare thy ouerthrow,</line>
<line>More then my Bodies parting with my Soule:</line>
<line>My Loue and Feare, glew&#8217;d many Friends to thee,</line>
<line>And now I fall. Thy tough Commixtures melts,</line>
<line>Impairing Henry, &#383;trength'ning misproud Yorke;</line>
<line>And whether flye the Gnats, but to the Sunne?</line>
<line>And who &#383;hines now, but Henries Enemies?</line>
<line>O Ph&#339;bus! had'st thou neuer giuen consent,</line>
<line>That Phaeton &#383;hould checke thy fiery Steeds,</line>
<line>Thy burning Carre neuer had &#383;corch&#8217;d the earth.</line>
<line>And Henry, had'st thou &#383;way&#8217;d as Kings &#383;hould do,</line>
<line>Or as thy Father, and his Father did,</line>
<line>Giuing no ground vnto the house of Yorke,</line>
<line>They neuer then had &#383;prung like Sommer Flyes:</line>
<line>I, and ten thousand in this luckle&#383;&#383;e Realme,</line>
<line>Had left no mourning Widdowes for our death,</line>
<line>And thou this day, had'st kept thy Chaire in peace.</line>
<line>For what doth cherrish Weeds, but gentle ayre?</line>
<line>And what makes Robbers bold, but too much lenity?</line>
<line>Bootle&#383;&#383;e are Plaints, and Curele&#383;&#383;e are my Wounds:</line>
<line>No way to flye, no &#383;trength to hold out flight:</line>
<line>The F&#339; is mercile&#383;&#383;e, and will not pitty:</line>
<line>For at their hands I haue deseru&#8217;d no pitty.</line>
<line>The ayre hath got into my deadly Wounds,</line>
<line>And much effuse of blood, doth make me faint:</line>
<line>Come Yorke, and Richard, Warwicke, and the rest,</line>
<line>I &#383;tab&#8217;d your Fathers bosomes; Split my brest.</line>

<line>No, &#8216;tis impo&#383;&#383;ible he &#383;hould escape:</line>

<line>In hewing Rutland, when his leaues put forth,</line>
<line>But &#383;et his murth'ring knife vnto the Roote,</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>War.</speaker>
<line>I thinke his vnderstanding is bereft:</line>
<line>Speake Clifford, dost thou know who &#383;peakes to thee?</line>
<line>Darke cloudy death ore-shades his beames of life,</line>
<line>And he nor &#383;ees, nor heares vs, what we &#383;ay.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Rich.</speaker>
<line>O would he did, and &#383;o (perhaps) he doth,</line>
<line>&#8216;Tis but his policy to counterfet,</line>
<line>Because he would auoid &#383;uch bitter taunts</line>
<line>Which in the time of death he gaue our Father.</line>

<speaker>Cla.</speaker>
<line>If &#383;o thou think'st,</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Ric.</speaker>
<line>What, not an Oath? Nay then the world go's hard</line>
<line>When Clifford cannot &#383;pare his Friends an oath:</line>
<line>I know by that he's dead, and by my Soule,</line>
<line>If this right hand would buy two houres life,</line>
<line>That I (in all despight) might rayle at him,</line>
<line>This hand &#383;hould chop it off: &amp; with the i&#383;&#383;uing Blood</line>
<line>Stifle the Villaine, whose vnstanched thirst</line>
<line>Yorke, and yong Rutland could not &#383;atisfie</line>

<line>My Queene and Son are gone to France for aid:</line>

<line>I: thither gone, to craue the French Kings Sister</line>
<line>To wife for Edward. If this newes be true,</line>
<line>Poore Queene, and Sonne, your labour is but lost:</line>
<line>For Warwicke is a &#383;ubtle Orator:</line>
<line>And Lewis a Prince &#383;oone wonne with mouing words:</line>
<line>By this account then, Margaret may winne him,</line>
<line>For &#383;he's a woman to be pittied much:</line>
<line>Her &#383;ighes will make a batt'ry in his brest,</line>
<line>Her teares will pierce into a Marble heart:</line>
<line>The Tyger will be milde, whiles &#383;he doth mourne;</line>
<line>And Nero will be tainted with remorse,</line>
<line>To heare and &#383;ee her plaints, her Brinish Teares.</line>
<line>I, but &#383;hee's come to begge, Warwicke to giue:</line>
<line>Shee on his left &#383;ide, crauing ayde for Henrie;</line>
<line>He on his right, asking a wife for Edward.</line>
<line>Shee Weepes, and &#383;ayes, her Henry is depos&#8217;d:</line>
<line>He Smiles, and &#383;ayes, his Edward is instaul&#8217;d;</line>
<line>That &#383;he (poore Wretch) for greefe can &#383;peake no more:</line>
<line>Whiles Warwicke tels his Title, &#383;mooths the Wrong,</line>
<line>Inferreth arguments of mighty &#383;trength,</line>
<line>And in conclusion winnes the King from her,</line>
<line>With promise of his Sister, and what else,</line>
<line>To &#383;trengthen and &#383;upport King Edwards place.</line>
<line>O Margaret, thus 'twill be, and thou (poore &#383;oule)</line>

<line>My Crowne is in my heart, not on my head:</line>
<line>Not deck&#8217;d with Diamonds, and Indian &#383;tones:</line>
<line>Nor to be &#383;eene: my Crowne, is call&#8217;d Content,</line>

<speaker>Hum.</speaker>
<line>Well, if you be a King crown&#8217;d with Content,</line>

<line>Ah &#383;imple men, you know not what you &#383;weare:</line>

<line>And as the Ayre blowes it to me againe,</line>
<line>Obeying with my winde when I do blow,</line>
<line>And yeelding to another, when it blowes,</line>
<line>Commanded alwayes by the greater gust:</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Rich.</speaker>
<line>The Match is made, &#383;hee &#383;eales it with a Cursie.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>But &#383;tay thee, &#8216;tis the fruits of loue I meane.</line>

<line>The fruits of Loue, I meane, my louing Liege.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Wid.</speaker>
<line>My loue till death, my humble thanks, my prayers,</line>
<line>That loue which Vertue begges, and Vertue graunts.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>No, by my troth, I did not meane &#383;uch loue.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Wid.</speaker>
<line>Why then you meane not, as I thought you did.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>But now you partly may perceiue my minde.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Wid.</speaker>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>To tell thee plaine, I ayme to lye with thee.</line>

<speech>

<line>To tell you plaine, I had rather lye in Prison.</line>

<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>Why then thou &#383;halt not haue thy Husbands</line>
<line>Lands.</line>
</speech>

<speech>

<line>For by that lo&#383;&#383;e, I will not purchase them.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>Therein thou wrong'st thy Children mightily.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Wid.</speaker>
<line>Herein your Highne&#383;&#383;e wrongs both them &amp; me:</line>
<line>But mightie Lord, this merry inclination</line>
<line>Accords not with the &#383;adne&#383;&#383;e of my &#383;uit:</line>

<line>One way, or other, &#383;hee is for a King,</line>
<line>And &#383;hee &#383;hall be my Loue, or else my Queene.</line>
<line>Say, that King Edward take thee for his Queene?</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Wid.</speaker>
<line>&#8216;Tis better &#383;aid then done, my gracious Lord:</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Wid.</speaker>
<line>And that is more then I will yeeld vnto:</line>
<line>I know, I am too meane to be your Queene,</line>
<line>And yet too good to be your Concubine.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>You cauill, Widow, I did meane my Queene.</line>

<speaker>Wid.</speaker>
<line>'Twill grieue your Grace, my Sonnes &#383;hould call you Father.</line>

<line>Call thee Mother.</line>
<line>Thou art a Widow, and thou hast &#383;ome Children,</line>
<line>And by Gods Mother, I being but a Batchelor,</line>
<line>Haue other-some. Why, &#8216;tis a happy thing,</line>
<line>To be the Father vnto many Sonnes:</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Rich.</speaker>
<line>The Ghostly Father now hath done his Shrift.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>Brothers, you muse what Chat wee two haue had.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Rich.</speaker>
<line>The Widow likes it not, for &#383;hee lookes very &#383;ad.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Clarence.</speaker>
<line>To who, my Lord?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>Why Clarence, to my &#383;elfe.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Rich.</speaker>
<line>That would be tenne dayes wonder at the least.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Clarence.</speaker>
<line>That's a day longer then a Wonder lasts.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Rich.</speaker>
<line>By &#383;o much is the Wonder in extremes.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>Well, ieast on Brothers: I can tell you both,</line>
<line>Her &#383;uit is graunted for her Husbands Lands.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter a Noble man.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>Nob.</speaker>
<line>My gracious Lord, Henry your F&#339; is taken,</line>
<line>And brought your Prisoner to your Pallace Gate.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>See that he be conuey&#8217;d vnto the Tower:</line>
<line>And goe wee Brothers to the man that tooke him,</line>
<line>To question of his apprehension.</line>
<line>Widow goe you along: Lords vse her honourable.</line>
</speech>
<stagedir>Exeunt.</stagedir>
<stagedir>Manet Richard.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>Rich.</speaker>
<line>I, Edward will vse Women honourably:</line>
<line>Would he were wasted, Marrow, Bones, and all,</line>
<line>That from his Loynes no hopefull Branch may &#383;pring,</line>
<line>To cro&#383;&#383;e me from the Golden time I looke for:</line>
<line>And yet, betweene my Soules desire, and me,</line>
<line>The lustfull Edwards Title buryed,</line>
<line>Is Clarence, Henry, and his Sonne young Edward,</line>
<line>And all the vnlook&#8217;d-for I&#383;&#383;ue of their Bodies,</line>
<line>To take their Roomes, ere I can place my &#383;elfe:</line>
<line>A cold premeditation for my purpose.</line>
<line>Why then I doe but dreame on Soueraigntie,</line>
<line>Like one that &#383;tands vpon a Promontorie,</line>
<line>And &#383;pyes a farre-off &#383;hore, where hee would tread,</line>
<line>Wishing his foot were equall with his eye,</line>
<line>And chides the Sea, that &#383;unders him from thence,</line>
<line>Saying, hee'le lade it dry, to haue his way:</line>
<line>So doe I wish the Crowne, being &#383;o farre off,</line>
<line>And &#383;o I chide the meanes that keepes me from it,</line>
<line>And &#383;o (I &#383;ay) Ile cut the Causes off,</line>
<line>Flattering me with impo&#383;&#383;ibilities:</line>
<line>My Eyes too quicke, my Heart o&#8217;re-weenes too much,</line>
<line>Vnle&#383;&#383;e my Hand and Strength could equall them.</line>
<line>Well, &#383;ay there is no Kingdome then for Richard:</line>
<line>What other Pleasure can the World affoord?</line>
<line>Ile make my Heauen in a Ladies Lappe,</line>
<line>And decke my Body in gay Ornaments,</line>
<line>And 'witch &#383;weet Ladies with my Words and Lookes.</line>
<line>Oh miserable Thought! and more vnlikely,</line>
<line>Then to accomplish twentie Golden Crownes.</line>
<line>Why Loue forswore me in my Mothers Wombe:</line>
<line>And for I &#383;hould not deale in her &#383;oft Lawes,</line>
<line>Shee did corrupt frayle Nature with &#383;ome Bribe,</line>
<line>To &#383;hrinke mine Arme vp like a wither&#8217;d Shrub,</line>
<line>To make an enuious Mountaine on my Back,</line>
<line>Where &#383;its Deformitie to mocke my Body;</line>
<line>To &#383;hape my Legges of an vnequall &#383;ize,</line>
<line>To dis-proportion me in euery part:</line>
<line>Like to a Chaos, or an vn-lick&#8217;d Beare-whelpe,</line>
<line>That carryes no impre&#383;&#383;ion like the Damme.</line>
<line>And am I then a man to be belou&#8217;d?</line>
<line>Oh monstrous fault, to harbour &#383;uch a thought.</line>
<line>Then &#383;ince this Earth affoords no Ioy to me,</line>
<line>But to command, to check, to o&#8217;re-beare &#383;uch,</line>
<line>As are of better Person then my &#383;elfe:</line>
<line>Ile make my Heauen, to dreame vpon the Crowne,</line>
<line>And whiles I liue, t&#8217; account this World but Hell,</line>
<line>Vntill my mis-shap&#8217;d Trunke, that beares this Head,</line>
<line>Be round impaled with a glorious Crowne.</line>
<line>And yet I know not how to get the Crowne,</line>
<line>For many Liues &#383;tand betweene me and home:</line>
<line>And I, like one lost in a Thornie Wood,</line>
<line>That rents the Thornes, and is rent with the Thornes,</line>
<line>Seeking a way, and &#383;traying from the way,</line>
<line>Not knowing how to finde the open Ayre,</line>
<line>But toyling desperately to finde it out,</line>
<line>Torment my &#383;elfe, to catch the English Crowne:</line>
<line>And from that torment I will free my &#383;elfe,</line>
<line>Or hew my way out with a bloody Axe.</line>
<line>Why I can &#383;mile, and murther whiles I &#383;mile,</line>
<line>And cry, Content, to that which grieues my Heart,</line>
<line>And wet my Cheekes with artificiall Teares,</line>
<line>And frame my Face to all occasions.</line>
<line>Ile drowne more Saylers then the Mermaid &#383;hall,</line>
<line>Ile &#383;lay more gazers then the Basiliske,</line>
<line>Ile play the Orator as well as Nestor,</line>
<line>Deceiue more &#383;lyly then Vli&#383;&#383;es could,</line>
<line>And like a Synon, take another Troy.</line>
<line>I can adde Colours to the Camelion,</line>
<line>Change &#383;hapes with Proteus, for aduantages,</line>
<line>And &#383;et the murtherous Macheuill to Schoole.</line>
<line>Can I doe this, and cannot get a Crowne?</line>
<line>Tut, were it farther off, Ile plucke it downe.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit.</stagedir>

<stagedir>Flourish. Enter Lewis the French King, his Sister Bona, his Admirall, call&#8217;d Bourbon: Prince Edward, Queene Margaret, and the Earle of Oxford. Lewis &#383;its, and riseth vp againe</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>Lewis.</speaker>
<line>Faire Queene of England, worthy Margaret,</line>
<line>Sit downe with vs: it ill befits thy State,</line>
<line>And Birth, that thou &#383;hould'st &#383;tand, while Lewis doth &#383;it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Marg.</speaker>
<line>No, mightie King of France: now Margaret</line>
<line>Must &#383;trike her &#383;ayle, and learne a while to &#383;erue,</line>
<line>Where Kings command. I was (I must confe&#383;&#383;e)</line>
<line>Great Albions Queene, in former Golden dayes:</line>
<line>But now mischance hath trod my Title downe,</line>
<line>And with dis-honor layd me on the ground,</line>
<line>Where I must take like Seat vnto my fortune,</line>
<line>And to my humble Seat conforme my &#383;elfe.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Lewis.</speaker>
<line>Why &#383;ay, faire Queene, whence &#383;prings this deepe despaire?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Marg.</speaker>
<line>From &#383;uch a cause, as fills mine eyes with teares,</line>
<line>And &#383;tops my tongue, while heart is drown&#8217;d in cares.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Lewis.</speaker>
<line>What ere it be, be thou &#383;till like thy &#383;elfe,</line>
<line>And &#383;it thee by our &#383;ide.</line>
<line><stagedir>Seats her by him.</stagedir></line>
<line>Yeeld not thy necke to Fortunes yoake,</line>
<line>But let thy dauntle&#383;&#383;e minde &#383;till ride in triumph,</line>
<line>Ouer all mischance.</line>
<line>Be plaine, Queene Margaret, and tell thy griefe,</line>
<line>It &#383;hall be eas&#8217;d, if France can yeeld reliefe.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Marg.</speaker>
<line>Those gracious words</line>
<line>Reuiue my drooping thoughts,</line>
<line>And giue my tongue-ty&#8217;d &#383;orrowes leaue to &#383;peake.</line>
<line>Now therefore be it knowne to Noble Lewis,</line>
<line>That Henry, &#383;ole po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;or of my Loue,</line>
<line>Is, of a King, become a banisht man,</line>
<line>And forc&#8217;d to liue in Scotland a Forlorne;</line>
<line>While prowd ambitious Edward, Duke of Yorke,</line>
<line>Vsurpes the Regall Title, and the Seat</line>
<line>Of Englands true anoynted lawfull King.</line>
<line>This is the cause that I, poore Margaret,</line>
<line>With this my Sonne, Prince Edward, Henries Heire,</line>
<line>Am come to craue thy iust and lawfull ayde:</line>
<line>And if thou faile vs, all our hope is done.</line>
<line>Scotland hath will to helpe, but cannot helpe:</line>
<line>Our People, and our Peeres, are both mis-led,</line>
<line>Our Treasure &#383;eiz&#8217;d, our Souldiors put to flight,</line>
<line>And (as thou &#383;eest) our &#383;elues in heauie plight.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Lewis.</speaker>
<line>Renowned Queene,</line>
<line>With patience calme the Storme,</line>
<line>While we bethinke a meanes to breake it off.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Marg.</speaker>
<line>The more wee &#383;tay, the &#383;tronger growes our</line>
<line>F&#339;.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Lewis.</speaker>
<line>The more I &#383;tay, the more Ile &#383;uccour thee.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Marg.</speaker>
<line>O, but impatience waiteth on true &#383;orrow.</line>
<line>And &#383;ee where comes the breeder of my &#383;orrow.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Warwicke.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>Lewis.</speaker>
<line>What's hee approacheth boldly to our pre-sence?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Marg.</speaker>
<line>Our Earle of Warwicke, Edwards greatest</line>
<line>Friend.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Lewis.</speaker>
<line>Welcome braue Warwicke, what brings thee to France?</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Hee descends. Shee ariseth.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>Marg.</speaker>
<line>I now begins a &#383;econd Storme to rise,</line>
<line>For this is hee that moues both Winde and Tyde.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Warw.</speaker>
<line>From worthy Edward, King of Albion,</line>
<line>My Lord and Soueraigne, and thy vowed Friend,</line>
<line>I come (in Kindne&#383;&#383;e, and vnfayned Loue)</line>
<line>First, to doe greetings to thy Royall Person,</line>
<line>And then to craue a League of Amitie:</line>
<line>And lastly, to confirme that Amitie</line>
<line>With Nuptiall Knot, if thou vouchsafe to graunt</line>
<line>That vertuous Lady Bona, thy faire Sister,</line>
<line>To Englands King, in lawfull Marriage.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Marg.</speaker>
<line>If that goe forward, Henries hope is done.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Warw</speaker>
<line>And gracious Madame,</line>
<line><stagedir>Speaking to Bona.</stagedir></line>
<line>In our Kings behalfe,</line>
<line>I am commanded, with your leaue and fauor,</line>
<line>Humbly to ki&#383;&#383;e your Hand, and with my Tongue</line>
<line>To tell the pa&#383;&#383;ion of my Soueraignes Heart;</line>
<line>Where Fame, late entring at his heedfull Eares,</line>
<line>Hath plac&#8217;d thy Beauties Image, and thy Vertue.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Marg.</speaker>
<line>King Lewis, and Lady Bona, heare me &#383;peake,</line>
<line>Before you an&#383;wer Warwicke. His demand</line>
<line>Springs not from Edwards well-meant hone&#383;t Loue,</line>
<line>But from Deceit, bred by Nece&#383;&#383;itie:</line>
<line>For how can Tyrants &#383;afely gouerne home,</line>
<line>Vnle&#383;&#383;e abroad they purchase great allyance?</line>
<line>To proue him Tyrant, this reason may &#383;uffice,</line>
<line>That Henry liueth &#383;till: but were hee dead,</line>
<line>Yet here Prince Edward &#383;tands, King Henries Sonne.</line>
<line>Looke therefore Lewis, that by this League and Mariage</line>
<line>Thou draw not on thy Danger, and Dis-honor:</line>
<line>For though Vsurpers &#383;way the rule a while,</line>
<line>Yet Heau'ns are iust, and Time &#383;uppre&#383;&#383;eth Wrongs.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Warw.</speaker>
<line>Iniurious Margaret.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Edw.</speaker>
<line>And why not Queene?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Warw.</speaker>
<line>Because thy Father Henry did vsurpe,</line>
<line>And thou no more art Prince, then &#383;hee is Queene.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Oxf.</speaker>
<line>Then Warwicke disanulls great Iohn of Gaunt,</line>
<line>Which did &#383;ubdue the greatest part of Spaine;</line>
<line>And after Iohn of Gaunt, Henry the Fourth,</line>
<line>Whose Wisdome was a Mirror to the wisest:</line>
<line>And after that wise Prince, Henry the Fift,</line>
<line>Who by his Prowe&#383;&#383;e conquered all France:</line>
<line>From these, our Henry lineally descends.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Warw.</speaker>
<line>Oxford, how haps it in this &#383;mooth discourse,</line>
<line>You told not, how Henry the Sixt hath lost</line>
<line>All that, which Henry the Fift had gotten:</line>
<line>Me thinkes these Peeres of France &#383;hould &#383;mile at that.</line>
<line>But for the rest: you tell a Pedigree</line>
<line>Of threescore and two yeeres, a &#383;illy time</line>
<line>To make prescription for a Kingdomes worth.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Oxf.</speaker>
<line>Why Warwicke, canst thou &#383;peak against thy Liege,</line>
<line>Whom thou obeyd'st thirtie and &#383;ix yeeres,</line>
<line>And not bewray thy Treason with a Blush?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Warw.</speaker>
<line>Can Oxford, that did euer fence the right,</line>
<line>Now buckler Falsehood with a Pedigree?</line>
<line>For &#383;hame leaue Henry, and call Edward King.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Oxf.</speaker>
<line>Call him my King, by whose iniurious doome</line>
<line>My elder Brother, the Lord Aubrey Vere</line>
<line>Was done to death? and more then &#383;o, my Father,</line>
<line>Euen in the downe-fall of his mellow&#8217;d yeeres,</line>
<line>When Nature brought him to the doore of Death?</line>
<line>No Warwicke, no: while Life vpholds this Arme,</line>
<line>This Arme vpholds the House of Lancaster.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Warw.</speaker>
<line>And I the House of Yorke.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Lewis.</speaker>
<line>Queene Margaret, Prince Edward, and Oxford,</line>
<line>Vouchsafe at our request, to &#383;tand aside,</line>
<line>While I vse further conference with Warwicke.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>They &#383;tand aloofe.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>Marg.</speaker>
<line>Heauens graunt, that Warwickes wordes be-witch him not.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Lew.</speaker>
<line>Now Warwicke, tell me euen vpon thy conscience</line>
<line>Is Edward your true King? for I were loth</line>
<line>To linke with him, that were not lawfull chosen.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Warw.</speaker>
<line>Thereon I pawne my Credit, and mine Ho-nor.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Lewis.</speaker>
<line>But is hee gracious in the Peoples eye?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Warw.</speaker>
<line>The more, that Henry was vnfortunate.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Lewis.</speaker>
<line>Then further: all di&#383;&#383;embling &#383;et aside,</line>
<line>Tell me for truth, the measure of his Loue</line>
<line>Vnto our Sister Bona.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>War.</speaker>
<line>Such it &#383;eemes,</line>
<line>As may beseeme a Monarch like himselfe.</line>
<line>My &#383;elfe haue often heard him &#383;ay, and &#383;weare,</line>
<line>That this his Loue was an externall Plant,</line>
<line>Whereof the Root was fixt in Vertues ground,</line>
<line>The Leaues and Fruit maintain&#8217;d with Beauties Sunne,</line>
<line>Exempt from Enuy, but not from Disdaine,</line>
<line>Vnle&#383;&#383;e the Lady Bona quit his paine.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Lewis.</speaker>
<line>Now Sister, let vs heare your firme resolue.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Bona.</speaker>
<line>Your graunt, or your denyall, &#383;hall be mine.</line>
<line>Yet I confe&#383;&#383;e, that often ere this day,</line>
<line><stagedir>Speaks to War[wicke].</stagedir></line>
<line>When I haue heard your Kings desert recounted,</line>
<line>Mine eare hath tempted iudgement to desire.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Lewis.</speaker>
<line>Then Warwicke, thus:</line>
<line>Our Sister &#383;hall be Edwards.</line>
<line>And now forthwith &#383;hall Articles be drawne,</line>
<line>Touching the Ioynture that your King must make,</line>

<line>That I am cleere from this misdeed of Edwards;</line>
<line>No more my King, for he dishonors me,</line>
<line>But mo&#8217;t himselfe, if he could &#383;ee his &#383;hame.</line>
<line>Did I forget, that by the House of Yorke</line>
<line>My Father came vntimely to his death?</line>
<line>Did I let pa&#383;&#383;e th&#8217; abuse done to my Neece?</line>
<line>Did I impale him with the Regall Crowne?</line>
<line>Did I put Henry from his Natiue Right?</line>
<line>And am I guerdon&#8217;d at the last, with Shame?</line>
<line>Shame on himselfe, for my Desert is Honor.</line>
<line>And to repaire my Honor lost for him,</line>
<line>I heere renounce him, and returne to Henry.</line>
<line>My Noble Queene, let former grudges pa&#383;&#383;e,</line>

<line>And force the Tyrant from his &#383;eat by Warre.</line>
<line>&#8216;Tis not his new-made Bride &#383;hall &#383;uccour him.</line>
<line>And as for Clarence, as my Letters tell me,</line>
<line>Hee's very likely now to fall from him,</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Rich.</speaker>
<line>And his well-chosen Bride.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Clarence.</speaker>
<line>I minde to tell him plainly what I thinke.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>Now Brother of Clarence,</line>
<line>How like you our Choyce,</line>
<line>That you &#383;tand pensiue, as halfe malecontent?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Clarence.</speaker>
<line>As well as Lewis of France,</line>
<line>Or the Earle of Warwicke,</line>
<line>Which are &#383;o weake of courage, and in iudgement,</line>
<line>That they'le take no offence at our abuse.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>Suppose they take offence without a cause:</line>
<line>They are but Lewis and Warwicke, I am Edward,</line>
<line>Your King and Warwickes, and must haue my will.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Rich.</speaker>
<line>And &#383;hall haue your will, because our King:</line>
<line>Yet hastie Marriage &#383;eldome proueth well.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>Yea, Brother Richard, are you offended too?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Rich.</speaker>
<line>Not I: no:</line>
<line>God forbid, that I &#383;hould wish them &#383;euer&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Whom God hath ioyn&#8217;d together:</line>
<line>I, and 'twere pittie, to &#383;under them,</line>
<line>That yoake &#383;o well together.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>Setting your &#383;kornes, and your mislike aside,</line>
<line>Tell me &#383;ome reason, why the Lady Grey</line>
<line>Should not become my Wife, and Englands Queene?</line>
<line>And you too, Somerset, and Mountague,</line>
<line>Speake freely what you thinke.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Clarence.</speaker>
<line>Then this is mine opinion:</line>
<line>That King Lewis becomes your Enemie,</line>
<line>For mocking him about the Marriage</line>
<line>Of the Lady Bona.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Rich.</speaker>
<line>And Warwicke, doing what you gaue in charge,</line>
<line>Is now dis-honored by this new Marriage.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>What, if both Lewis and Warwick be appeas&#8217;d,</line>
<line>By &#383;uch inuention as I can deuise?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Mount.</speaker>
<line>Yet, to haue ioyn&#8217;d with France in &#383;uch alliance,</line>
<line>Would more haue &#383;trength'ned this our Commonwealth</line>
<line>'Gainst forraine &#383;tormes, then any home-bred Marriage.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Hast.</speaker>
<line>Why, knowes not Mountague, that of it &#383;elfe,</line>
<line>England is &#383;afe, if true within it &#383;elfe?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Mount.</speaker>
<line>But the &#383;afer, when &#8216;tis back&#8217;d with France.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Hast.</speaker>
<line>&#8216;Tis better vsing France, then trusting France:</line>
<line>Let vs be back&#8217;d with God, and with the Seas,</line>
<line>Which he hath giu'n for fence impregnable,</line>
<line>And with their helpes, onely defend our &#383;elues:</line>
<line>In them, and in our &#383;elues, our &#383;afetie lyes.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Clar.</speaker>
<line>For this one &#383;peech, Lord Hastings well deserues</line>

<line>And for this once, my Will &#383;hall &#383;tand for Law.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Rich.</speaker>
<line>And yet me thinks, your Grace hath not done well,</line>
<line>To giue the Heire and Daughter of Lord Scales</line>
<line>Vnto the Brother of your louing Bride;</line>
<line>Shee better would haue fitted me, or Clarence:</line>
<line>But in your Bride you burie Brotherhood.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Clar.</speaker>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>Alas, poore Clarence: is it for a Wife</line>
<line>That thou art malecontent? I will prouide thee.</line>

<line>In chusing for your &#383;elfe,</line>

<line>To play the Broker in mine owne behalfe;</line>
<line>And to that end, I &#383;hortly minde to leaue you.</line>

<line>Leaue me, or tarry, Edward will be King,</line>

<line>So your dislikes, to whom I would be pleasing,</line>
<line>Doth cloud my ioyes with danger, and with &#383;orrow.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>My Loue, forbeare to fawne vpon their frownes:</line>
<line>What danger, or what &#383;orrow can befall thee,</line>
<line>So long as Edward is thy constant friend,</line>
<line>And their true Soueraigne, whom they must obey?</line>
<line>Nay, whom they &#383;hall obey, and loue thee too,</line>
<line>Vnle&#383;&#383;e they &#383;eeke for hatred at my hands:</line>
<line>Which if they doe, yet will I keepe thee &#383;afe,</line>
<line>And they &#383;hall feele the vengeance of my wrath.</line>

<line>The Night-Crow cry&#8217;de, aboding luckle&#383;&#383;e time,</line>

<line>Teeth had'st thou in thy head, when thou was't borne,</line>

<line>Let Hell make crook&#8217;d my Minde to an&#383;wer it.</line>
<line>I haue no Brother, I am like no Brother:</line>
<line>And this word (Loue) which Gray-beards call Diuine,</line>
<line>Be resident in men like one another,</line>
<line>And not in me: I am my &#383;elfe alone.</line>
<line>Clarence beware, thou keept'st me from the Light,</line>
<line>But I will &#383;ort a pitchy day for thee:</line>
<line>For I will buzze abroad &#383;uch Prophesies,</line>
<line>That Edward &#383;hall be fearefull of his life,</line>
<line>And then to purge his feare, Ile be thy death.</line>
<line>King Henry, and the Prince his Son are gone,</line>
<line>Clarence thy turne is next, and then the rest,</line>
<line>Counting my &#383;elfe but bad, till I be best.</line>
