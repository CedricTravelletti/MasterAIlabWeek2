My Sonnes, God knowes what hath bechanced them: But this I know, they haue demean&#8217;d themselues Like men borne to Renowne, by Life or Death. Three times did Richard make a Lane to me, And thrice cry&#8217;de, Courage Father, fight it out: And full as oft came Edward to my &#383;ide, With Purple Faulchion, painted to the Hilt, In blood of those that had encountred him: And when the hardyest Warriors did retyre, Richard cry&#8217;de, Charge, and giue no foot of ground, And cry&#8217;de, A Crowne, or else a glorious Tombe, A Scepter, or an Earthly Sepulchre. With this we charg&#8217;d againe: but out alas, We bodg&#8217;d againe, as I haue &#383;eene a Swan With bootle&#383;&#383;e labour &#383;wimme against the Tyde, And &#383;pend her &#383;trength with ouer-matching Waues. <STAGEDIR>A &#383;hort Alarum within.</STAGEDIR> Ah hearke, the fatall followers doe pursue, And I am faint, and cannot flye their furie: And were I &#383;trong, I would not &#383;hunne their furie, The Sands are numbred, that makes vp my Life, Here must I &#383;tay, and here my Life must end. <STAGEDIR>Enter the Queene, Clifford, Northumberland, the young Prince, and Souldiers</STAGEDIR> Come bloody Clifford, rough Northumberland, I dare your quenchle&#383;&#383;e furie to more rage: I am your Butt, and I abide your Shot.</LINE>

<LINE>I &#383;aw him in the Battaile range about,</LINE>
<LINE>And watcht him how he &#383;ingled Clifford forth.</LINE>
<LINE>Me thought he bore him in the thickest troupe,</LINE>
<LINE>As doth a Lyon in a Heard of Neat,</LINE>
<LINE>Or as a Beare encompa&#383;&#383;&#8217;d round with Dogges:</LINE>
<LINE>Who hauing pincht a few, and made them cry,</LINE>

<LINE>So far&#8217;d our Father with his Enemies,</LINE>
<LINE>So fled his Enemies my Warlike Father:</LINE>
<LINE>Me thinkes &#8216;tis prize enough to be his Sonne.</LINE>
<LINE>See how the Morning opes her golden Gates,</LINE>

<LINE>Ten dayes ago, I drown&#8217;d these newes in teares.</LINE>
<LINE>And now to adde more measure to your w&#339;s,</LINE>
<LINE>I come to tell you things &#383;ith then befalne.</LINE>
<LINE>After the bloody Fray at Wakefield fought,</LINE>
<LINE>Where your braue Father breath&#8217;d his latest gaspe,</LINE>
<LINE>Tydings, as &#383;wiftly as the Postes could runne,</LINE>
<LINE>Were brought me of your Lo&#383;&#383;e, and his Depart.</LINE>
<LINE>I then in London, keeper of the King,</LINE>
<LINE>Muster&#8217;d my Soldiers, gathered flockes of Friends,</LINE>
<LINE>Marcht toward S[aint]. Albons, to intercept the Queene,</LINE>
<LINE>Bearing the King in my behalfe along:</LINE>
<LINE>For by my Scouts, I was aduertised</LINE>
<LINE>That &#383;he was comming with a full intent</LINE>
<LINE>To dash our late Decree in Parliament,</LINE>
<LINE>Touching King Henries Oath, and your Succe&#383;&#383;ion:</LINE>
<LINE>Short Tale to make, we at S[aint]. Albons met,</LINE>
<LINE>Our Battailes ioyn&#8217;d, and both &#383;ides fiercely fought:</LINE>
<LINE>But whether 'twas the coldne&#383;&#383;e of the King,</LINE>
<LINE>Who look&#8217;d full gently on his warlike Queene,</LINE>
<LINE>That robb&#8217;d my Soldiers of their heated Spleene.</LINE>
<LINE>Or whether 'twas report of her &#383;ucce&#383;&#383;e,</LINE>
<LINE>Or more then common feare of Cliffords Rigour,</LINE>
<LINE>Who thunders to his Captiues, Blood and Death,</LINE>
<LINE>I cannot iudge: but to conclude with truth,</LINE>
<LINE>Their Weapons like to Lightning, came and went:</LINE>
<LINE>Our Souldiers like the Night-Owles lazie flight,</LINE>
<LINE>Or like a lazie Thresher with a Flaile,</LINE>
<LINE>Fell gently downe, as if they &#383;trucke their Friends.</LINE>
<LINE>I cheer&#8217;d them vp with iustice of our Cause,</LINE>
<LINE>With promise of high pay, and great Rewards:</LINE>
<LINE>But all in vaine, they had no heart to fight,</LINE>
<LINE>And we (in them) no hope to win the day,</LINE>
<LINE>So that we fled: the King vnto the Queene,</LINE>
<LINE>Lord George, your Brother, Norfolke, and my Selfe,</LINE>
<LINE>In haste, post haste, are come to ioyne with you:</LINE>
<LINE>For in the Marches heere we heard you were,</LINE>
<LINE>Making another Head, to fight againe.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>Were he as famous, and as bold in Warre,</LINE>

<LINE>I know it well Lord Warwick, blame me not,</LINE>

<LINE>Shall we go throw away our Coates of Steele,</LINE>

<LINE>Numb'ring our Aue-Maries with our Beads?</LINE>

<LINE>If for the last, &#383;ay I, and to it Lords.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>With Clifford, and the haught Northumberland,</LINE>
<LINE>And of their Feather, many moe proud Birds,</LINE>
<LINE>Haue wrought the easie-melting King, like Wax.</LINE>
<LINE>He &#383;wore consent to your Succe&#383;&#383;ion,</LINE>
<LINE>His Oath enrolled in the Parliament.</LINE>
<LINE>And now to London all the crew are gone,</LINE>
<LINE>To frustrate both his Oath, and what beside</LINE>
<LINE>May make against the house of Lancaster.</LINE>
<LINE>Their power (I thinke) is thirty thousand &#383;trong:</LINE>
<LINE>Now, if the helpe of Norfolke, and my &#383;elfe,</LINE>
<LINE>With all the Friends that thou braue Earle of March,</LINE>
<LINE>Among'st the louing Welshmen can'st procure,</LINE>
<LINE>Will but amount to fiue and twenty thousand,</LINE>
<LINE>Why Via, to London will we march,</LINE>
<LINE>And once againe, bestride our foaming Steeds,</LINE>
<LINE>And once againe cry Charge vpon our F&#339;s,</LINE>
<LINE>But neuer once againe turne backe and flye.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>Rich.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I, now me thinks I heare great Warwick &#383;peak;</LINE>
<LINE>Ne're may he liue to &#383;ee a Sun-shine day,</LINE>

<SPEAKER>Hen.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This battell fares like to the mornings Warre, When dying clouds contend, with growing light, What time the Shepheard blowing of his nailes, Can neither call it perfect day, nor night. Now &#383;wayes it this way, like a Mighty Sea, Forc&#8217;d by the Tide, to combat with the Winde: Now &#383;wayes it that way, like the &#383;elfe-&#383;ame Sea, Forc&#8217;d to retyre by furie of the Winde. Sometime, the Flood preuailes; and than the Winde: Now, one the better: then, another best; Both tugging to be Victors, brest to brest: Yet neither Conqueror, nor Conquered. So is the equall poise of this fell Warre. Heere on this Mole-hill will I &#383;it me downe, To whom God will, there be the Victorie: For Margaret my Queene, and Clifford too Haue chid me from the Battell: Swearing both, They prosper best of all when I am thence. Would I were dead, if Gods good will were &#383;o; For what is in this world, but Greefe and W&#339;. Oh God! me thinkes it were a happy life, To be no better then a homely Swaine, To &#383;it vpon a hill, as I do now, To carue out Dialls queintly, point by point, Thereby to &#383;ee the Minutes how they runne: How many makes the Houre full compleate, How many Houres brings about the Day, How many Dayes will finish vp the Yeare, How many Yeares, a Mortall man may liue. When this is knowne, then to diuide the Times: So many Houres, must I tend my Flocke; So many Houres, must I take my Rest: So many Houres, must I Contemplate: So many Houres, must I Sport my &#383;elfe: So many Dayes, my Ewes haue bene with yong: So many weekes, ere the poore Fooles will Eane: So many yeares, ere I &#383;hall &#383;heere the Fleece: So Minutes, Houres, Dayes, Monthes, and Yeares, Past ouer to the end they were created, Would bring white haires, vnto a Quiet graue. Ah! what a life were this? How &#383;weet? how louely? Giues not the Hawthorne bush a &#383;weeter &#383;hade To Shepheards, looking on their &#383;illy Sheepe, Then doth a rich Imbroider&#8217;d Canopie To Kings, that feare their Subiects treacherie? Oh yes, it doth; a thousand fold it doth. And to conclude, the Shepherds homely Curds, His cold thinne drinke out of his Leather Bottle, His wonted &#383;leepe, vnder a fresh trees &#383;hade, All which &#383;ecure, and &#383;weetly he enioyes, Is farre beyond a Princes Delicates: His Viands &#383;parkling in a Golden Cup, His bodie couched in a curious bed, When Care, Mistrust, and Treason waits on him.</LINE>

<LINE>I, Edward will vse Women honourably:</LINE>

<LINE>That from his Loynes no hopefull Branch may &#383;pring,</LINE>
<LINE>To cro&#383;&#383;e me from the Golden time I looke for:</LINE>
<LINE>And yet, betweene my Soules desire, and me,</LINE>
<LINE>The lustfull Edwards Title buryed,</LINE>
<LINE>Is Clarence, Henry, and his Sonne young Edward,</LINE>
<LINE>And all the vnlook&#8217;d-for I&#383;&#383;ue of their Bodies,</LINE>
<LINE>To take their Roomes, ere I can place my &#383;elfe:</LINE>
<LINE>A cold premeditation for my purpose.</LINE>
<LINE>Why then I doe but dreame on Soueraigntie,</LINE>
<LINE>Like one that &#383;tands vpon a Promontorie,</LINE>
<LINE>And &#383;pyes a farre-off &#383;hore, where hee would tread,</LINE>
<LINE>Wishing his foot were equall with his eye,</LINE>
<LINE>And chides the Sea, that &#383;unders him from thence,</LINE>
<LINE>Saying, hee'le lade it dry, to haue his way:</LINE>
<LINE>So doe I wish the Crowne, being &#383;o farre off,</LINE>
<LINE>And &#383;o I chide the meanes that keepes me from it,</LINE>
<LINE>And &#383;o (I &#383;ay) Ile cut the Causes off,</LINE>
<LINE>Flattering me with impo&#383;&#383;ibilities:</LINE>
<LINE>My Eyes too quicke, my Heart o&#8217;re-weenes too much,</LINE>
<LINE>Vnle&#383;&#383;e my Hand and Strength could equall them.</LINE>
<LINE>Well, &#383;ay there is no Kingdome then for Richard:</LINE>
<LINE>What other Pleasure can the World affoord?</LINE>
<LINE>Ile make my Heauen in a Ladies Lappe,</LINE>
<LINE>And decke my Body in gay Ornaments,</LINE>
<LINE>And 'witch &#383;weet Ladies with my Words and Lookes.</LINE>
<LINE>Oh miserable Thought! and more vnlikely,</LINE>
<LINE>Then to accomplish twentie Golden Crownes.</LINE>
<LINE>Why Loue forswore me in my Mothers Wombe:</LINE>
<LINE>And for I &#383;hould not deale in her &#383;oft Lawes,</LINE>
<LINE>Shee did corrupt frayle Nature with &#383;ome Bribe,</LINE>
<LINE>To &#383;hrinke mine Arme vp like a wither&#8217;d Shrub,</LINE>
<LINE>To make an enuious Mountaine on my Back,</LINE>
<LINE>Where &#383;its Deformitie to mocke my Body;</LINE>
<LINE>To &#383;hape my Legges of an vnequall &#383;ize,</LINE>
<LINE>To dis-proportion me in euery part:</LINE>
<LINE>Like to a Chaos, or an vn-lick&#8217;d Beare-whelpe,</LINE>
<LINE>That carryes no impre&#383;&#383;ion like the Damme.</LINE>
<LINE>And am I then a man to be belou&#8217;d?</LINE>
<LINE>Oh monstrous fault, to harbour &#383;uch a thought.</LINE>
<LINE>Then &#383;ince this Earth affoords no Ioy to me,</LINE>
<LINE>But to command, to check, to o&#8217;re-beare &#383;uch,</LINE>
<LINE>As are of better Person then my &#383;elfe:</LINE>
<LINE>Ile make my Heauen, to dreame vpon the Crowne,</LINE>
<LINE>And whiles I liue, t&#8217; account this World but Hell,</LINE>
<LINE>Vntill my mis-shap&#8217;d Trunke, that beares this Head,</LINE>
<LINE>Be round impaled with a glorious Crowne.</LINE>
<LINE>And yet I know not how to get the Crowne,</LINE>
<LINE>For many Liues &#383;tand betweene me and home:</LINE>
<LINE>And I, like one lost in a Thornie Wood,</LINE>
<LINE>That rents the Thornes, and is rent with the Thornes,</LINE>
<LINE>Seeking a way, and &#383;traying from the way,</LINE>
<LINE>Not knowing how to finde the open Ayre,</LINE>
<LINE>But toyling desperately to finde it out,</LINE>
<LINE>Torment my &#383;elfe, to catch the English Crowne:</LINE>
<LINE>And from that torment I will free my &#383;elfe,</LINE>
<LINE>Or hew my way out with a bloody Axe.</LINE>
<LINE>Why I can &#383;mile, and murther whiles I &#383;mile,</LINE>
<LINE>And cry, Content, to that which grieues my Heart,</LINE>
<LINE>And wet my Cheekes with artificiall Teares,</LINE>
<LINE>And frame my Face to all occasions.</LINE>
<LINE>Ile drowne more Saylers then the Mermaid &#383;hall,</LINE>
<LINE>Ile &#383;lay more gazers then the Basiliske,</LINE>
<LINE>Ile play the Orator as well as Nestor,</LINE>
<LINE>Deceiue more &#383;lyly then Vli&#383;&#383;es could,</LINE>
<LINE>And like a Synon, take another Troy.</LINE>
<LINE>I can adde Colours to the Camelion,</LINE>
<LINE>Change &#383;hapes with Proteus, for aduantages,</LINE>
<LINE>And &#383;et the murtherous Macheuill to Schoole.</LINE>
<LINE>Can I doe this, and cannot get a Crowne?</LINE>
<LINE>Tut, were it farther off, Ile plucke it downe.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>No, mightie King of France: now Margaret</LINE>
<LINE>Must &#383;trike her &#383;ayle, and learne a while to &#383;erue,</LINE>

<LINE>Springs not from Edwards well-meant hone&#383;t Loue,</LINE>

<LINE>For how can Tyrants &#383;afely gouerne home,</LINE>
<LINE>Vnle&#383;&#383;e abroad they purchase great allyance?</LINE>
<LINE>To proue him Tyrant, this reason may &#383;uffice,</LINE>

<LINE>Looke therefore Lewis, that by this League and Mariage</LINE>

<LINE>Oxford, how haps it in this &#383;mooth discourse,</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<LINE>Call him my King, by whose iniurious doome</LINE>

<LINE>No Warwicke, no: while Life vpholds this Arme,</LINE>

<LINE>Exempt from Enuy, but not from Disdaine,</LINE>

<LINE>Did I forget, that by the House of Yorke</LINE>
<LINE>My Father came vntimely to his death?</LINE>
<LINE>Did I let pa&#383;&#383;e th&#8217; abuse done to my Neece?</LINE>
<LINE>Did I impale him with the Regall Crowne?</LINE>
<LINE>Did I put Henry from his Natiue Right?</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Rich.</SPEAKER>

<LINE>What, if both Lewis and Warwick be appeas&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>By &#383;uch inuention as I can deuise?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Mount.</SPEAKER>
