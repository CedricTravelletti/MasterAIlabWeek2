<stagedir>Enter two Gentlemen.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>1.Gent.</speaker>
<line>You do not meet a man but Frownes.</line>
<line>Our bloods no more obey the Heauens</line>
<line>Then our Courtiers:</line>
<line>Still &#383;eeme, as do's the Kings.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2 Gent.</speaker>
<line>But what&#8217;s the matter?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1.</speaker>
<line>His daughter, and the heire of's kingdome (whom</line>
<line>He purpos&#8217;d to his wiues &#383;ole Sonne, a Widdow</line>
<line>That late he married) hath referr&#8217;d her &#383;elfe</line>
<line>Vnto a poore, but worthy Gentleman. She's wedded,</line>
<line>Her Husband banish&#8217;d; &#383;he imprison&#8217;d, all</line>
<line>Is outward &#383;orrow, though I thinke the King</line>
<line>Be touch&#8217;d at very heart.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2</speaker>
<line>None but the King?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1</speaker>
<line>He that hath lost her too: &#383;o is the Queene,</line>
<line>That mo&#8217;t desir&#8217;d the Match. But not a Courtier,</line>
<line>Although they weare their faces to the bent</line>
<line>Of the Kings lookes, hath a heart that is not</line>
<line>Glad at the thing they &#383;cowle at.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2</speaker>
<line>And why &#383;o?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1</speaker>
<line>He that hath mi&#383;&#383;&#8217;d the Prince&#383;&#383;e, is a thing</line>
<line>Too bad, for bad report: and he that hath her,</line>
<line>(I meane, that married her, alacke good man,</line>
<line>And therefore banish&#8217;d) is a Creature, &#383;uch,</line>
<line>As to &#383;eeke through the Regions of the Earth</line>
<line>For one, his like; there would be &#383;omething failing</line>
<line>In him, that &#383;hould compare. I do not thinke,</line>
<line>So faire an Outward, and &#383;uch &#383;tuffe Within</line>
<line>Endowes a man, but hee.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2</speaker>
<line>You &#383;peake him farre.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1</speaker>
<line>I do extend him (Sir) within himselfe,</line>
<line>Crush him together, rather then vnfold</line>
<line>His measure duly.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2</speaker>
<line>What's his name, and Birth?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1</speaker>
<line>I cannot delue him to the roote: His Father</line>
<line>Was call&#8217;d Sicillius, who did ioyne his Honor</line>
<line>Against the Romanes, with Ca&#383;&#383;ibulan,</line>
<line>But had his Titles by Tenantius, whom</line>
<line>He &#383;eru&#8217;d with Glory, and admir&#8217;d Succe&#383;&#383;e:</line>
<line>So gain&#8217;d the Sur-addition, Leonatus.</line>
<line>And had (besides this Gentleman in question)</line>
<line>Two other Sonnes, who in the Warres o'th&#8217; time</line>
<line>Dy&#8217;de with their Swords in hand. For which, their Father</line>
<line>Then old, and fond of y&#383;&#383;ue, tooke &#383;uch &#383;orrow</line>
<line>That he quit Being; and his gentle Lady</line>
<line>Bigge of this Gentleman (our Theame) deceast</line>
<line>As he was borne. The King he takes the Babe</line>
<line>To his protection, cals him Posthumus Leonatus,</line>
<line>Breedes him, and makes him of his Bed-chamber,</line>
<line>Puts to him all the Learnings that his time</line>
<line>Could make him the receiuer of, which he tooke</line>
<line>As we do ayre, fast as 'twas ministred,</line>
<line>And in's Spring, became a Haruest: Liu&#8217;d in Court</line>
<line>(Which rare it is to do) mo&#8217;t prais&#8217;d, mo&#8217;t lou&#8217;d,</line>
<line>A &#383;ample to the yongest: to th&#8217; more Mature,</line>
<line>A gla&#383;&#383;e that feated them: and to the grauer,</line>
<line>A Childe that guided Dotards. To his Mistris,</line>
<line>(For whom he now is banish&#8217;d) her owne price</line>
<line>Proclaimes how &#383;he esteem&#8217;d him; and his Vertue</line>
<line>By her electio[n] may be truly read, what kind of man he is.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2</speaker>
<line>I honor him, euen out of your report.</line>
<line>But pray you tell me, is &#383;he &#383;ole childe to'th&#8217; King?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1</speaker>
<line>His onely childe:</line>
<line>He had two Sonnes (if this be worth your hearing,</line>
<line>Marke it) the eldest of them, at three yeares old</line>
<line>I'th&#8217; &#383;wathing cloathes, the other from their Nursery</line>
<line>Were &#383;tolne, and to this houre, no ghe&#383;&#383;e in knowledge</line>
<line>Which way they went.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2</speaker>
<line>How long is this ago?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1</speaker>
<line>Some twenty yeares.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2</speaker>
<line>That a Kings Children &#383;hould be &#383;o conuey&#8217;d,</line>
<line>So &#383;lackely guarded, and the &#383;earch &#383;o &#383;low</line>
<line>That could not trace them.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1</speaker>
<line>Hows&#339;re, &#8216;tis &#383;trange,</line>
<line>Or that the negligence may well be laugh&#8217;d at:</line>
<line>Yet is it true Sir.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2</speaker>
<line>I do well beleeue you.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Imo.</speaker>
<line>O di&#383;&#383;embling Curtesie! How fine this Tyrant</line>

<line>I &#383;omething feare my Fathers wrath, but nothing</line>
<line>(Alwayes reseru&#8217;d my holy duty) what</line>
<line>His rage can do on me. You must be gone,</line>

<line>But that there is this Iewell in the world,</line>

<line>My Queene, my Mistris:</line>
<line>O Lady, weepe no more, least I giue cause</line>
<line>To be &#383;uspected of more tenderne&#383;&#383;e</line>

<speaker>Imo.</speaker>
<line>Nay, &#383;tay a little:</line>
<line>Were you but riding forth to ayre your &#383;elfe,</line>
<line>Such parting were too petty. Looke heere (Loue)</line>

<line>I am very glad on't.</line>
</speech>

<speech>

<line>Sir, I would aduise you to &#383;hift a Shirt; the Vio-lence of Action hath made you reek as a Sacrifice: where ayre comes out, ayre comes in: There's none abroad &#383;o wholesome as that you vent.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>2</speaker>
<line>No faith: not &#383;o much as his patience.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1</speaker>
<line>Hurt him? His bodie's a pa&#383;&#383;able Carka&#383;&#383;e if he bee not hurt. It is a through-fare for Steele if it be not hurt.</line>
</speech>

<speech>

<line>His Steele was in debt, it went o'th&#8217; Backe-side the</line>

<line>Sir, as I told you alwayes: her Beauty &amp; her Braine go not together. Shee's a good &#383;igne, but I haue &#383;eene &#383;mall reflection of her wit.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Pisa.</speaker>
<line>No Madam: for &#383;o long</line>
<line>As he could make me with his eye, or eare,</line>
<line>Distinguish him from others, he did keepe</line>
<line>The Decke, with Gloue, or Hat, or Handkerchife,</line>

<line>How I would thinke on him at certaine houres,</line>
<line>Such thoughts, and &#383;uch: Or I could make him &#383;weare,</line>
<line>The Shees of Italy &#383;hould not betray</line>
<line>Mine Interest, and his Honour: or haue charg&#8217;d him</line>
<line>At the &#383;ixt houre of Morne, at Noone, at Midnight,</line>
<line>T' encounter me with Orisons, for then</line>
<line>I am in Heauen for him: Or ere I could,</line>
<line>Giue him that parting ki&#383;&#383;e, which I had &#383;et</line>
<line>Betwixt two charming words, comes in my Father,</line>
<line>And like the Tyrannous breathing of the North,</line>

<stagedir>Enter Philario, Iachimo: a Frenchman, a Dutch-man, and a Spaniard</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>Iach.</speaker>
<line>Beleeue it Sir, I haue &#383;eene him in Britaine; hee was then of a Cre&#383;&#383;ent note, expected to proue &#383;o woor-thy, as &#383;ince he hath beene allowed the name of. But I could then haue look&#8217;d on him, without the help of Ad-miration, though the Catalogue of his endowments had bin tabled by his &#383;ide, and I to peruse him by Items.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Phil.</speaker>
<line>You &#383;peake of him when he was le&#383;&#383;e furnish&#8217;d, then now hee is, with that which makes him both with-out, and within.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>French.</speaker>
<line>I haue &#383;eene him in France: wee had very ma-ny there, could behold the Sunne, with as firme eyes as hee.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Iach.</speaker>
<line>This matter of marrying his Kings Daughter, wherein he must be weighed rather by her valew, then his owne, words him (I doubt not) a great deale from the matter.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>French.</speaker>
<line>And then his banishment.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Iach.</speaker>
<line>I, and the approbation of those that weepe this lamentable diuorce vnder her colours, are wonderfully to extend him, be it but to fortifie her iudgement, which else an easie battery might lay flat, for taking a Begger without le&#383;&#383;e quality. But how comes it, he is to &#383;oiourne with you? How creepes acquaintance?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Phil.</speaker>
<line>His Father and I were Souldiers together, to whom I haue bin often bound for no le&#383;&#383;e then my life. <stagedir>Enter Posthumus.</stagedir> Heere comes the Britaine. Let him be &#383;o entertained a-mong'st you, as &#383;uites with Gentlemen of your knowing, to a Stranger of his quality. I beseech you all be better knowne to this Gentleman, whom I commend to you, as a Noble Friend of mine. How Worthy he is, I will leaue to appeare hereafter, rather then &#383;tory him in his owne hearing.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>French.</speaker>
<line>Sir, we haue knowne togither in Orleance.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Post.</speaker>
<line>Since when, I haue bin debtor to you for courte-sies, which I will be euer to pay, and yet pay &#383;till.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>French.</speaker>
<line>Sir, you o&#8217;re-rate my poore kindne&#383;&#383;e, I was glad I did attone my Countryman and you: it had beene pitty you &#383;hould haue beene put together, with &#383;o mor-tall a purpose, as then each bore, vpon importance of &#383;o &#383;light and triuiall a nature.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Post.</speaker>
<line>By your pardon Sir, I was then a young Trauel-ler, rather &#383;hun&#8217;d to go euen with what I heard, then in my euery action to be guided by others experiences: but vpon my mended iudgement (if I offend to &#383;ay it is men-ded) my Quarrell was not altogether &#383;light.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>French.</speaker>
<line>Faith yes, to be put to the arbiterment of Swords, and by &#383;uch two, that would by all likelyhood haue confounded one the other, or haue falne both.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Iach.</speaker>
<line>Can we with manners, aske what was the dif-ference?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>French.</speaker>
<line>Safely, I thinke, 'twas a contention in pub-licke, which may (without contradiction) &#383;uffer the re-port. It was much like an argument that fell out last night, where each of vs fell in praise of our Country-Mistre&#383;&#383;es. This Gentleman, at that time vouching (and vpon warrant of bloody affirmation) his to be more Faire, Vertuous, Wise, Chaste, Constant, Qualified, and le&#383;&#383;e attemptible then any, the rarest of our Ladies in Fraunce.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Iach.</speaker>
<line>That Lady is not now liuing; or this Gentle-mans opinion by this, worne out.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Post.</speaker>
<line>She holds her Vertue &#383;till, and I my mind.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Iach.</speaker>
<line>You must not &#383;o farre preferre her, 'fore ours of</line>
<line>Italy.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Posth.</speaker>
<line>Being &#383;o farre prouok&#8217;d as I was in France: I would abate her nothing, though I profe&#383;&#383;e my &#383;elfe her Adorer, not her Friend.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Iach.</speaker>
<line>As faire, and as good: a kind of hand in hand comparison, had beene &#383;omething too faire, and too good for any Lady in Britanie; if &#383;he went before others. I haue &#383;eene as that Diamond of yours out-lusters many I haue beheld, I could not beleeue &#383;he excelled many: but I haue not &#383;eene the mo&#8217;t pretious Diamond that is, nor you the Lady.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Post.</speaker>
<line>I prais&#8217;d her, as I rated her: &#383;o do I my Stone.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Iach.</speaker>
<line>What do you esteeme it at?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Post.</speaker>
<line>More then the world enioyes.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Iach.</speaker>
<line>Either your vnparagon&#8217;d Mistris is dead, or &#383;he's out-priz&#8217;d by a trifle.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Post.</speaker>
<line>You are mistaken: the one may be &#383;olde or gi-uen, or if there were wealth enough for the purchases, or merite for the guift. The other is not a thing for &#383;ale, and onely the guift of the Gods.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Iach.</speaker>
<line>Which the Gods haue giuen you?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Post.</speaker>
<line>Which by their Graces I will keepe.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Iach.</speaker>
<line>You may weare her in title yours: but you know &#383;trange Fowle light vpon neighbouring Ponds. Your Ring may be &#383;tolne too, &#383;o your brace of vnprizea-ble Estimations, the one is but fraile, and the other Casu-all; A cunning Thiefe, or a (that way) accomplish&#8217;d Courtier, would hazzard the winning both of first and last.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Post.</speaker>
<line>Your Italy, containes none &#383;o accomplish&#8217;d a Courtier to conuince the Honour of my Mistris: if in the holding or lo&#383;&#383;e of that, you terme her fraile, I do no-thing doubt you haue &#383;tore of Theeues, notwithstanding I feare not my Ring.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Phil.</speaker>
<line>Let vs leaue heere, Gentlemen?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Post.</speaker>
<line>Sir, with all my heart. This worthy Signior I thanke him, makes no &#383;tranger of me, we are familiar at first.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Iach.</speaker>
<line>With fiue times &#383;o much conuersation, I &#383;hould get ground of your faire Mistris; make her go backe, e-uen to the yeilding, had I admittance, and opportunitie to friend.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Post.</speaker>
<line>No, no.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Iach.</speaker>
<line>I dare thereupon pawne the moytie of my E-state, to your Ring, which in my opinion o&#8217;re-values it &#383;omething: but I make my wager rather against your Confidence, then her Reputation. And to barre your of-fence heerein to, I durst attempt it against any Lady in the world.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Post.</speaker>
<line>You are a great deale abus&#8217;d in too bold a per-swasion, and I doubt not you &#383;ustaine what y'are worthy of, by your Attempt.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Iach.</speaker>
<line>What's that?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Posth.</speaker>
<line>A Repulse though your Attempt (as you call it) deserue more; a punishment too.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Phi.</speaker>
<line>Gentlemen enough of this, it came in too &#383;o-dainely, let it dye as it was borne, and I pray you be bet-ter acquainted.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Iach.</speaker>
<line>Would I had put my Estate, and my Neighbors on th&#8217; approbation of what I haue &#383;poke.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Post.</speaker>
<line>What Lady would you chuse to a&#383;&#383;aile?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Iach.</speaker>
<line>Yours, whom in constancie you thinke &#383;tands &#383;o &#383;afe. I will lay you ten thousands Duckets to your Ring, that commend me to the Court where your La-dy is, with no more aduantage then the opportunitie of a &#383;econd conference, and I will bring from thence, that Honor of hers, which you imagine &#383;o reseru&#8217;d.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Posthmus.</speaker>
<line>I will wage against your Gold, Gold to it: My Ring I holde deere as my finger, &#8216;tis part of it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Iach.</speaker>
<line>You are a Friend, and there in the wiser: if you buy Ladies flesh at a Million a Dram, you cannot pre-serue it from tainting; but I &#383;ee you haue &#383;ome Religion in you, that you feare.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Posthu.</speaker>
<line>This is but a custome in your tongue: you beare a grauer purpose I hope.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Iach.</speaker>
<line>I am the Master of my &#383;peeches, and would vn-der-go what&#8217;s &#383;poken, I &#383;weare.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Posthu.</speaker>
<line>Will you? I &#383;hall but lend my Diamond till your returne: let there be Couenants drawne between's. My Mistris exceedes in goodne&#383;&#383;e, the hugene&#383;&#383;e of your vnworthy thinking. I dare you to this match: heere's my Ring.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Phil.</speaker>
<line>I will haue it no lay.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Iach.</speaker>
<line>By the Gods it is one: if I bring you no &#383;uffi-cient testimony that I haue enioy&#8217;d the deerest bodily part of your Mistris: my ten thousand Duckets are yours, &#383;o is your Diamond too: if I come off, and leaue her in &#383;uch honour as you haue trust in; Shee your Iewell, this your Iewell, and my Gold are yours: prouided, I haue your commendation, for my more free entertainment.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Post.</speaker>
<line>I embrace these Conditions, let vs haue Articles betwixt vs: onely thus farre you &#383;hall answere, if you make your voyage vpon her, and giue me directly to vn-derstand, you haue preuayl&#8217;d, I am no further your Ene-my, &#383;hee is not worth our debate. If &#383;hee remaine vnse-duc&#8217;d, you not making it appeare otherwise: for your ill opinion, and th&#8217; a&#383;&#383;ault you haue made to her chastity, you &#383;hall an&#383;wer me with your Sword.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Iach.</speaker>
<line>Your hand, a Couenant: wee will haue these things &#383;et downe by lawfull Counsell, and &#383;traight away for Britaine, least the Bargaine &#383;hould catch colde, and &#383;terue: I will fetch my Gold, and haue our two Wagers recorded.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Post.</speaker>
<line>Agreed.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>French.</speaker>
<line>Will this hold, thinke you.</line>

<line>Pleaseth your Highnes, I: here they are, Madam:</line>
<line>But I beseech your Grace, without offence</line>
<line>(My Conscience bids me aske) wherefore you haue</line>

<line>I do not like her. She doth thinke &#383;he ha's</line>

<line>And will not trust one of her malice, with</line>
<line>A drugge of &#383;uch damn&#8217;d Nature. Those &#383;he ha's,</line>

<line>No danger in what &#383;hew of death it makes,</line>
<line>More then the locking vp the Spirits a time,</line>

<line>I Madam, with his eyes in flood with laughter,</line>
<line>It is a Recreation to be by</line>
<line>And heare him mocke the Frenchman:</line>
<line>But Heauen's know &#383;ome men are much too blame.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Imo.</speaker>
<line>Not he I hope.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Iach.</speaker>
<line>Not he:</line>
<line>But yet Heauen's bounty towards him, might</line>

<line>In you, which I account his beyond all Talents.</line>
<line>Whil'st I am bound to wonder, I am bound</line>
<line>To pitty too.</line>

<line>It is an office of the Gods to venge it,</line>
<line>Not mine to &#383;peake on't.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Imo.</speaker>
<line>You do &#383;eeme to know</line>
<line>Something of me, or what concernes me; pray you</line>
<line>Since doubting things go ill, often hurts more</line>
<line>Then to be &#383;ure they do. For Certainties</line>
<line>Either are past remedies; or timely knowing,</line>
<line>The remedy then borne. Discouer to me</line>
<line>What both you &#383;pur and &#383;top.</line>
</speech>

<line>(Whose euery touch) would force the Feelers &#383;oule</line>
<line>To'th&#8217; oath of loyalty. This obiect, which</line>
<line>Takes prisoner the wild motion of mine eye,</line>
<line>Fiering it onely heere, &#383;hould I (damn&#8217;d then)</line>
<line>Slauuer with lippes as common as the &#383;tayres</line>
<line>That mount the Capitoll: Ioyne gripes, with hands</line>
<line>Made hard with hourely falshood (falshood as</line>
<line>With labour:) then by peeping in an eye</line>
<line>Base and illustrious as the &#383;moakie light</line>
<line>That's fed with &#383;tinking Tallow: it were fit</line>
<line>That all the plagues of Hell &#383;hould at one time</line>
<line>Encounter &#383;uch reuolt.</line>
</speech>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Iach.</speaker>
<line>O deerest Soule: your Cause doth &#383;trike my hart</line>
<line>With pitty, that doth make me &#383;icke. A Lady</line>
<line>So faire, and fasten&#8217;d to an Emperie</line>
<line>Would make the great'st King double, to be partner&#8217;d</line>
<line>With Tomboyes hyr&#8217;d, with that &#383;elfe exhibition</line>
<line>Which your owne Coffers yeeld: with diseas&#8217;d ventures</line>
<line>That play with all Infirmities for Gold,</line>
<line>Which rottenne&#383;&#383;e can lend Nature. Such boyl&#8217;d &#383;tuffe</line>
<line>As well might poyson Poyson. Be reueng&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Or &#383;he that bore you, was no Queene, and you</line>
<line>Recoyle from your great Stocke.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Imo.</speaker>
<line>Reueng&#8217;d:</line>
<line>How &#383;hould I be reueng&#8217;d? If this be true,</line>
<line>(As I haue &#383;uch a Heart, that both mine eares</line>
<line>Must not in haste abuse) if it be true,</line>
<line>How &#383;hould I be reueng&#8217;d?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Iach.</speaker>
<line>Should he make me</line>
<line>Liue like Diana's Priest, betwixt cold &#383;heets,</line>
<line>Whiles he is vaulting variable Rampes</line>
<line>In your despight, vpon your purse: reuenge it.</line>
<line>I dedicate my &#383;elfe to your &#383;weet pleasure,</line>

<line>Thou would'st haue told this tale for Vertue, not</line>
<line>For &#383;uch an end thou &#383;eek'st, as base, as &#383;trange:</line>
<line>Thou wrong'st a Gentleman, who is as farre</line>
<line>From thy report, as thou from Honor: and</line>
<line>Solicites heere a Lady, that disdaines</line>
<line>Thee, and the Diuell alike. What hoa, Pisanio?</line>
<line>The King my Father &#383;hall be made acquainted</line>
<line>Of thy A&#383;&#383;ault: if he &#383;hall thinke it fit,</line>
<line>A &#383;awcy Stranger in his Court, to Mart</line>
<line>As in a Romish Stew, and to expound</line>
<line>His beastly minde to vs; he hath a Court</line>
<line>He little cares for, and a Daughter, who</line>
<line>He not respects at all. What hoa, Pisanio?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Iach.</speaker>
<line>O happy Leonatus I may &#383;ay,</line>
<line>The credit that thy Lady hath of thee</line>
<line>Deserues thy trust, and thy mo&#8217;t perfect goodne&#383;&#383;e</line>

<line>A Lady to the worthiest Sir, that euer</line>
<line>Country call&#8217;d his; and you his Mistris, onely</line>
<line>For the mo&#8217;t worthiest fit. Giue me your pardon,</line>
<line>I haue &#383;poke this to know if your Affiance</line>

<line>Halfe all men hearts are his.</line>

<line>He &#383;its 'mongst men, like a defended God;</line>
<line>He hath a kinde of Honor &#383;ets him off,</line>
<line>More then a mortall &#383;eeming. Be not angrie</line>
<line>(Mo&#8217;t mighty Prince&#383;&#383;e) that I haue aduentur&#8217;d</line>

<line>In the election of a Sir, &#383;o rare,</line>
<line>Which you know, cannot erre. The loue I beare him,</line>
<line>Made me to fan you thus, but the Gods made you</line>
<line>(Vnlike all others) chaffele&#383;&#383;e. Pray your pardon.</line>
</speech>

<line>One, bred of Almes, and foster&#8217;d with cold dishes,</line>

<line>If you can mak't apparant</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Iach.</speaker>
<line>Sir, my Circumstances</line>
<line>Being &#383;o nere the Truth, as I will make them,</line>
<line>Must first induce you to beleeue; whose &#383;trength</line>

<line>Proud Cleopatra, when &#383;he met her Roman,</line>
<line>And Sidnus &#383;well&#8217;d aboue the Bankes, or for</line>
<line>The pre&#383;&#383;e of Boates, or Pride. A peece of Worke</line>
<line>So brauely done, &#383;o rich, that it did &#383;triue</line>
<line>In Workemanship, and Value, which I wonder&#8217;d</line>
<line>Could be &#383;o rarely, and exactly wrought</line>
<line>Since the true life on't was&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>

<line>This is true:</line>

<line>More particulars</line>

<line>The Chimney</line>
<line>Is South the Chamber, and the Chimney-peece</line>

<line>The wager you haue laid.</line>

<line>When Iulius Caesar (whose remembrance yet</line>

<line>And Conquer&#8217;d it, Ca&#383;&#383;ibulan thine Vnkle</line>
<line>(Famous in Caesars prayses, no whit le&#383;&#383;e</line>
<line>Then in his Feats deseruing it) for him,</line>
<line>And his Succe&#383;&#383;ion, granted Rome a Tribute,</line>
<line>Yeerely three thousand pounds; which (by thee) lately</line>
<line>Is left vntender&#8217;d.</line>

<line>There be many Caesars,</line>

<line>By it &#383;elfe, and we will nothing pay</line>
<line>For wearing our owne Noses.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Qu.</speaker>
<line>That opportunity</line>
<line>Which then they had to take from's, to resume</line>
<line>We haue againe. Remember Sir, my Liege,</line>
<line>The Kings your Ancestors, together with</line>
<line>The naturall brauery of your Isle, which &#383;tands</line>
<line>As Neptunes Parke, ribb&#8217;d, and pal&#8217;d in</line>
<line>With Oakes vnskaleable, and roaring Waters,</line>
<line>With Sands that will not beare your Enemies Boates,</line>
<line>But &#383;ucke them vp to'th&#8217; Top-mast. A kinde of Conquest</line>
<line>Caesar made heere, but made not heere his bragge</line>
<line>Of Came, and Saw, and Ouer-came: with &#383;hame</line>
<line>(The first that euer touch&#8217;d him) he was carried</line>
<line>From off our Coast, twice beaten: and his Shipping</line>
<line>(Poore ignorant Baubles) on our terrible Seas</line>
<line>Like Egge-shels mou&#8217;d vpon their Surges, crack&#8217;d</line>

<line>Made Luds-Towne with reioycing-Fires bright,</line>

<line>Come, there's no more Tribute to be paid: our Kingdome is &#383;tronger then it was at that time: and (as I &#383;aid) there is no mo &#383;uch Caesars, other of them may haue crook&#8217;d Noses, but to owe &#383;uch &#383;traite Armes, none.</line>

<line>We haue yet many among vs, can gripe as hard as Ca&#383;&#383;ibulan, I doe not &#383;ay I am one: but I haue a hand. Why Tribute? Why &#383;hould we pay Tribute?

<speech>

<line>You must know,</line>
<line>Till the iniurious Romans, did extort</line>

<line>Did put the yoake vpon's; which to &#383;hake off</line>

<line>Our Ancestor was that Mulmutius, which</line>
<line>Ordain&#8217;d our Lawes, whose vse the Sword of Caesar</line>
<line>Hath too much mangled; whose repayre, and franchise,</line>
<line>Shall (by the power we hold) be our good deed,</line>
<line>Tho Rome be therfore angry. Mulmutius made our lawes</line>

<line>And felt them knowingly: the Art o'th&#8217; Court,</line>
<line>As hard to leaue, as keepe: whose top to climbe</line>
<line>Is certaine falling: or &#383;o &#383;lipp'ry, that</line>
<line>The feare's as bad as falling. The toyle o'th&#8217; Warre,</line>

<line>I'th&#8217; name of Fame, and Honor, which dyes i'th&#8217; &#383;earch,</line>

<line>Doth ill deserue, by doing well: what&#8217;s worse</line>
<line>Must curt'sie at the Censure. Oh Boyes, this Storie</line>
<line>The World may reade in me: My bodie's mark&#8217;d</line>
<line>With Roman Swords; and my report, was once</line>
<line>First, with the best of Note. Cymbeline lou&#8217;d me,</line>
<line>And when a Souldier was the Theame, my name</line>
<line>Was not farre off: then was I as a Tree</line>
<line>Whose boughes did bend with fruit. But in one night,</line>
<line>A Storme, or Robbery (call it what you will)</line>
<line>Shooke downe my mellow hangings: nay my Leaues,</line>
<line>And left me bare to weather.</line>

<line>Before my perfect Honor, &#383;wore to Cymbeline,</line>
<line>I was Confederate with the Romanes: &#383;o</line>

<line>More pious debts to Heauen, then in all</line>
<line>The fore-end of my time. But, vp to'th&#8217; Mountaines,</line>
<line>This is not Hunters Language; he that &#383;trikes</line>

<line>How hard it is to hide the &#383;parkes of Nature?</line>
<line>These Boyes know little they are Sonnes to'th&#8217; King,</line>

<line>They thinke they are mine,</line>
<line>And though train&#8217;d vp thus meanely</line>
<line>I'th&#8217; Caue, whereon the Bowe their thoughts do hit,</line>
<line>The Roofes of Palaces, and Nature prompts them</line>
<line>In &#383;imple and lowe things, to Prince it, much</line>
<line>Beyond the tricke of others. This Paladour,</line>

<line>Into my Story: &#383;ay thus mine Enemy fell,</line>
<line>And thus I &#383;et my foote on's necke, euen then</line>
<line>The Princely blood flowes in his Cheeke, he &#383;weats,</line>
<line>Straines his yong Nerues, and puts himselfe in posture</line>
<line>That acts my words. The yonger Brother Cadwall,</line>
<line>Once Aruiragus, in as like a figure</line>
<line>Strikes life into my &#383;peech, and &#383;hewes much more</line>
<line>His owne conceyuing. Hearke, the Game is rows&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Oh Cymbeline, Heauen and my Conscience knowes</line>
<line>Thou didd'st vniustly banish me: whereon</line>
<line>At three, and two yeeres old, I &#383;tole these Babes,</line>
<line>Thinking to barre thee of Succe&#383;&#383;ion, as</line>
<line>Thou refts me of my Lands. Euriphile,</line>

That part, thou (Pisanio) must acte for me, if thy Faith be not tainted with the breach of hers; let thine owne hands take away her life: I &#383;hall giue thee opportunity at Milford Hauen.

<line>Wilt lay the Leauen on all proper men;</line>
<line>Goodly, and gallant, &#383;hall be false and periur&#8217;d</line>
<line>From thy great faile: Come Fellow, be thou hone&#383;t,</line>

<line>Why, I must dye:</line>

<line>Corrupters of my Faith, you &#383;hall no more</line>

<line>Of Princely Fellowes, &#383;halt heereafter finde</line>
<line>It is no acte of common pa&#383;&#383;age, but</line>

<line>Ile wake mine eye-balles first.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Imo.</speaker>
<line>Wherefore then</line>
<line>Didd'st vndertake it? Why hast thou abus&#8217;d</line>
<line>So many Miles, with a pretence? This place?</line>
<line>Mine Action? and thine owne? Our Horses labour?</line>
<line>The Time inuiting thee? The perturb&#8217;d Court</line>

<line>Purpose returne. Why hast thou gone &#383;o farre</line>
<line>To be vn-bent? when thou hast 'tane thy &#383;tand,</line>
<line>Th&#8217; elected Deere before thee?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Pis.</speaker>
<line>But to win time</line>
<line>To loose &#383;o bad employment, in the which</line>
<line>I haue consider&#8217;d of a course: good Ladie</line>
<line>Heare me with patience.</line>

<line>Talke thy tongue weary, &#383;peake:</line>
<line>I haue heard I am a Strumpet, and mine eare</line>

<line>Bringing me heere to kill me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Pis.</speaker>
<line>Not &#383;o neither:</line>
<line>But if I were as wise, as hone&#383;t, then</line>
<line>My purpose would proue well: it cannot be,</line>
<line>But that my Master is abus&#8217;d. Some Villaine,</line>
<line>I, and &#383;ingular in his Art, hath done you both</line>
<line>This cursed iniurie.</line>

<line>Some Roman Curtezan?</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Pis.</speaker>
<line>If you'l backe to'th&#8217; Court.</line>

<line>No Court, no Father, nor no more ad&#339;</line>
<line>With that harsh, noble, &#383;imple nothing:</line>

<line>If not at Court,</line>

<line>Where then?</line>
<line>Hath Britaine all the Sunne that &#383;hines? Day? Night?</line>
<line>Are they not but in Britaine? I'th&#8217; worlds Volume</line>
<line>Our Britaine &#383;eemes as of it, but not in't:</line>
<line>In a great Poole, a Swannes-nest, prythee thinke</line>

<line>I cannot tell: Long is it &#383;ince I &#383;aw him,</line>
<line>But Time hath nothing blurr&#8217;d those lines of Fauour</line>
<line>Which then he wore: the &#383;natches in his voice,</line>

<line>Being &#383;carse made vp,</line>

<line>Yet I not doing this, the Foole had borne</line>
<line>My head, as I do his.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Bel.</speaker>
<line>What hast thou done?</line>
</speech>

<speech>

<line>I am perfect what: cut off one Clotens head,</line>
<line>Sonne to the Queene (after his owne report)</line>
<line>Who call&#8217;d me Traitor, Mountaineer, and &#383;wore</line>
<line>With his owne &#383;ingle hand heel&#8217;d take vs in,</line>

<speaker>Gui.</speaker>
<line>Why, worthy Father, what haue we to loose,</line>
<line>But that he &#383;wore to take our Liues? the Law</line>
<line>Protects not vs, then why &#383;hould we be tender,</line>
<line>To let an arrogant peece of flesh threat vs?</line>
<line>Play Iudge, and Executioner, all himselfe?</line>
<line>For we do feare the Law. What company</line>
<line>Discouer you abroad?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Bel.</speaker>
<line>No &#383;ingle &#383;oule</line>
<line>Can we &#383;et eye on: but in all &#383;afe reason</line>
<line>He must haue &#383;ome Attendants. Though his Honor</line>
<line>Was nothing but mutation, I, and that</line>
<line>From one bad thing to worse: Not Frenzie,</line>
<line>Not absolute madne&#383;&#383;e could &#383;o farre haue rau&#8217;d</line>
<line>To bring him heere alone: although perhaps</line>
<line>It may be heard at Court, that &#383;uch as wee</line>
<line>Caue heere, hunt heere, are Out-lawes, and in time</line>
<line>May make &#383;ome &#383;tronger head, the which he hearing,</line>
<line>(As it is like him) might breake out, and &#383;weare</line>
<line>Heel&#8217;d fetch vs in, yet is't not probable</line>
<line>To come alone, either he &#383;o vndertaking,</line>
<line>Or they &#383;o &#383;uffering: then on good ground we feare,</line>
<line>If we do feare this Body hath a taile</line>
<line>More perillous then the head.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Arui.</speaker>

<line>With his owne Sword,</line>

<line>Lady, the Gods throw &#383;tones of &#383;ulpher on me, if</line>
<line>That box I gaue you, was not thought by mee</line>

<line>Oh Gods!</line>
<line>I left out one thing which the Queene confest,</line>

<line>Which I gaue him for Cordiall, &#383;he is &#383;eru&#8217;d,</line>

<line>The Queene (Sir) very oft importun&#8217;d me</line>

<line>The &#383;atisfaction of her knowledge, onely</line>
<line>In killing Creatures vilde, as Cats and Dogges</line>
<line>Of no esteeme. I dreading, that her purpose</line>
<line>Was of more danger, did compound for her</line>
<line>A certaine &#383;tuffe, which being tane, would cease</line>
<line>The present powre of life, but in &#383;hort time,</line>
<line>All Offices of Nature, &#383;hould againe</line>
<line>Do their due Functions. Haue you tane of it?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Imo.</speaker>
<line>Mo&#8217;t like I did, for I was dead.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Bel.</speaker>
<line>My Boyes, there was our error.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Gui.</speaker>
<line>This is &#383;ure Fidele.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Imo.</speaker>
<line>Why did you throw your wedded Lady fro[m] you?</line>
<line>Thinke that you are vpon a Rocke, and now</line>
<line>Throw me againe.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Post.</speaker>
<line>Hang there like fruite, my &#383;oule,</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Cym.</speaker>
<line>How now, my Flesh? my Childe?</line>
<line>What, mak'st thou me a dullard in this Act?</line>
<line>Wilt thou not &#383;peake to me?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Imo.</speaker>
<line>Your ble&#383;&#383;ing, Sir.</line>

<line>Though you did loue this youth, I blame ye not,</line>
<line>You had a motiue for't.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Cym.</speaker>
<line>My teares that fall</line>
<line>Proue holy-water on thee; Imogen,</line>
<line>Thy Mothers dead.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Imo.</speaker>
<line>I am &#383;orry for't, my Lord.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Cym.</speaker>
<line>Oh, &#383;he was naught; and long of her it was</line>
<line>That we meet heere &#383;o &#383;trangely: but her Sonne</line>
<line>Is gone, we know not how, nor where.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Pisa.</speaker>
<line>My Lord,</line>
<line>Now feare is from me, Ile &#383;peake troth. Lord Cloten</line>
<line>Vpon my Ladies mi&#383;&#383;ing, came to me</line>
<line>With his Sword drawne, foam&#8217;d at the mouth, and &#383;wore</line>
<line>If I discouer&#8217;d not which way &#383;he was gone,</line>
<line>It was my instant death. By accident,</line>
<line>I had a feigned Letter of my Masters</line>
<line>Then in my pocket, which directed him</line>
<line>To &#383;eeke her on the Mountaines neere to Milford,</line>
<line>Where in a frenzie, in my Masters Garments</line>
<line>(Which he inforc&#8217;d from me) away he postes</line>
<line>With vnchaste purpose, and with oath to violate</line>
<line>My Ladies honor, what became of him,</line>
<line>I further know not.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Gui.</speaker>
<line>Let me end the Story: I &#383;lew him there.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Cym.</speaker>
<line>Marry, the Gods forefend.</line>
<line>I would not thy good deeds, &#383;hould from my lips</line>
<line>Plucke a hard &#383;entence: Prythee valiant youth</line>
<line>Deny't againe.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Gui.</speaker>
<line>I haue &#383;poke it, and I did it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Cym.</speaker>
<line>He was a Prince.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Gui.</speaker>
<line>A mo&#8217;t inciuill one. The wrongs he did mee</line>
<line>Were nothing Prince-like; for he did prouoke me</line>
<line>With Language that would make me &#383;purne the Sea,</line>
<line>If it could &#383;o roare to me. I cut off's head,</line>
<line>And am right glad he is not &#383;tanding heere</line>
<line>To tell this tale of mine.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Cym.</speaker>
<line>I am &#383;orrow for thee:</line>
<line>By thine owne tongue thou art condemn&#8217;d, and must</line>
<line>Endure our Law: Thou'rt dead.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Imo.</speaker>
<line>That headle&#383;&#383;e man I thought had bin my Lord</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Cym.</speaker>
<line>Binde the Offender,</line>
<line>And take him from our presence.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Bel.</speaker>
<line>Stay, Sir King.</line>
<line>This man is better then the man he &#383;lew,</line>
<line>As well descended as thy &#383;elfe, and hath</line>
<line>More of thee merited, then a Band of Clotens</line>
<line>Had euer &#383;carre for. Let his Armes alone,</line>
<line>They were not borne for bondage.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Cym.</speaker>
<line>Why old Soldier:</line>
<line>Wilt thou vndoo the worth thou art vnpayd for</line>
<line>By tasting of our wrath? How of descent</line>
<line>As good as we?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Arui.</speaker>
<line>In that he &#383;pake too farre.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Cym.</speaker>
<line>And thou &#383;halt dye for't.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Bel.</speaker>
<line>We will dye all three,</line>
<line>But I will proue that two one's are as good</line>
<line>As I haue giuen out him. My Sonnes, I must</line>
<line>For mine owne part, vnfold a dangerous &#383;peech,</line>
<line>Though haply well for you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Arui.</speaker>
<line>Your danger's ours.</line>
</speech>

<speech>

<line>And our good his.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Bel.</speaker>
<line>Haue at it then, by leaue</line>
<line>Thou hadd'st (great King) a Subiect, who</line>
<line>Was call&#8217;d Belarius.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Cym.</speaker>
<line>What of him? He is a banish&#8217;d Traitor.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Bel.</speaker>
<line>He it is, that hath</line>
<line>A&#383;&#383;um&#8217;d this age: indeed a banish&#8217;d man,</line>
<line>I know not how, a Traitor.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Cym.</speaker>
<line>Take him hence,</line>
<line>The whole world &#383;hall not &#383;aue him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Bel.</speaker>
<line>Not too hot;</line>
<line>First pay me for the Nursing of thy Sonnes,</line>
<line>And let it be confiscate all, &#383;o &#383;oone</line>
<line>As I haue receyu&#8217;d it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Cym.</speaker>
<line>Nursing of my Sonnes?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Bel.</speaker>
<line>I am too blunt, and &#383;awcy: heere's my knee:</line>
<line>Ere I arise, I will preferre my Sonnes,</line>
<line>Then &#383;pare not the old Father. Mighty Sir,</line>
<line>These two young Gentlemen that call me Father,</line>
<line>And thinke they are my Sonnes, are none of mine,</line>
<line>They are the y&#383;&#383;ue of your Loynes, my Liege,</line>
<line>And blood of your begetting.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Cym.</speaker>
<line>How? my I&#383;&#383;ue.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Bel.</speaker>
<line>So &#383;ure as you, your Fathers: I (old Morgan)</line>
<line>Am that Belarius, whom you &#383;ometime banish&#8217;d:</line>
<line>Your pleasure was my neere offence, my punishment</line>
<line>It &#383;elfe, and all my Treason that I &#383;uffer&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Was all the harme I did. These gentle Princes</line>
<line>(For &#383;uch, and &#383;o they are) these twenty yeares</line>
<line>Haue I train&#8217;d vp; those Arts they haue, as I</line>
<line>Could put into them. My breeding was (Sir)</line>
<line>As your Highne&#383;&#383;e knowes: Their Nurse Euriphile</line>
<line>(Whom for the Theft I wedded) &#383;tole these Children</line>
<line>Vpon my Banishment: I moou&#8217;d her too't,</line>
<line>Hauing receyu&#8217;d the punishment before</line>
<line>For that which I did then. Beaten for Loyaltie,</line>
<line>Excited me to Treason. Their deere lo&#383;&#383;e,</line>
<line>The more of you 'twas felt, the more it &#383;hap&#8217;d</line>
<line>Vnto my end of &#383;tealing them. But gracious Sir,</line>
<line>Heere are your Sonnes againe, and I must loose</line>
<line>Two of the &#383;weet'st Companions in the World.</line>
<line>The benediction of these couering Heauens</line>
<line>Fall on their heads like dew, for they are worthie</line>
<line>To in-lay Heauen with Starres.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Cym.</speaker>
<line>Thou weep'st, and &#383;peak'st:</line>
<line>The Seruice that you three haue done, is more</line>
<line>Vnlike, then this thou tell'st. I lost my Children,</line>
<line>If these be they, I know not how to wish</line>
<line>A payre of worthier Sonnes.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Bel.</speaker>
<line>Be pleas&#8217;d awhile;</line>
<line>This Gentleman, whom I call Polidore,</line>
<line>Mo&#8217;t worthy Prince, as yours, is true Guiderius:</line>
<line>This Gentleman, my Cadwall, Aruiragus.</line>
<line>Your yonger Princely Son, he Sir, was lapt</line>
<line>In a mo&#8217;t curious Mantle, wrought by th&#8217; hand</line>
<line>Of his Queene Mother, which for more probation</line>
<line>I can with ease produce.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Cym.</speaker>
<line>Guiderius had</line>
<line>Vpon his necke a Mole, a &#383;anguine Starre,</line>
<line>It was a marke of wonder.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Bel.</speaker>
<line>This is he,</line>
<line>Who hath vpon him &#383;till that naturall &#383;tampe:</line>
<line>It was wise Natures end, in the donation</line>
<line>To be his euidence now.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Cym.</speaker>
<line>Oh, what am I</line>
<line>A Mother to the byrth of three? Nere Mother</line>
<line>Reioyc&#8217;d deliuerance more: Blest, pray you be,</line>
<line>That after this &#383;trange &#383;tarting from your Orbes,</line>
<line>You may reigne in them now: Oh Imogen,</line>
<line>Thou hast lost by this a Kingdome.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Imo.</speaker>
<line>No, my Lord:</line>
<line>I haue got two Worlds by't. Oh my gentle Brothers,</line>
<line>Haue we thus met? Oh neuer &#383;ay heereafter</line>
<line>But I am truest &#383;peaker. You call&#8217;d me Brother</line>
<line>When I was but your Sister: I you Brothers,</line>
<line>When we were &#383;o indeed.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Cym.</speaker>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Cym.</speaker>
<line>O rare instinct!</line>
<line>When &#383;hall I heare all through? This fierce abridgment,</line>
<line>Hath to it Circumstantiall branches, which</line>
<line>Distinction &#383;hould be rich in. Where? how liu&#8217;d you?</line>
<line>And when came you to &#383;erue our Romane Captiue?</line>
<line>How parted with your Brother? How first met them?</line>
<line>Why fled you from the Court? And whether these?</line>
<line>And your three motiues to the Battaile? with</line>
<line>I know not how much more &#383;hould be demanded,</line>
<line>And all the other by-dependances</line>
<line>From chance to chance? But nor the Time, nor Place</line>
<line>Will &#383;erue our long Interrogatories. See,</line>
<line>Posthumus Anchors vpon Imogen;</line>
<line>And &#383;he (like harmle&#383;&#383;e Lightning) throwes her eye</line>
<line>On him: her Brothers, Me: her Master hitting</line>
<line>Each obiect with a Ioy: the Counter-change</line>
<line>Is &#383;euerally in all. Let's quit this ground,</line>
<line>And &#383;moake the Temple with our Sacrifices.</line>
<line>Thou art my Brother, &#383;o wee'l hold thee euer.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
