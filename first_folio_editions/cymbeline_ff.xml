<STAGEDIR>Enter two Gentlemen.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1.Gent.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You do not meet a man but Frownes.</LINE>
<LINE>Our bloods no more obey the Heauens</LINE>
<LINE>Then our Courtiers:</LINE>
<LINE>Still &#383;eeme, as do's the Kings.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2 Gent.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But what&#8217;s the matter?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>His daughter, and the heire of's kingdome (whom</LINE>
<LINE>He purpos&#8217;d to his wiues &#383;ole Sonne, a Widdow</LINE>
<LINE>That late he married) hath referr&#8217;d her &#383;elfe</LINE>
<LINE>Vnto a poore, but worthy Gentleman. She's wedded,</LINE>
<LINE>Her Husband banish&#8217;d; &#383;he imprison&#8217;d, all</LINE>
<LINE>Is outward &#383;orrow, though I thinke the King</LINE>
<LINE>Be touch&#8217;d at very heart.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2</SPEAKER>
<LINE>None but the King?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He that hath lost her too: &#383;o is the Queene,</LINE>
<LINE>That mo&#8217;t desir&#8217;d the Match. But not a Courtier,</LINE>
<LINE>Although they weare their faces to the bent</LINE>
<LINE>Of the Kings lookes, hath a heart that is not</LINE>
<LINE>Glad at the thing they &#383;cowle at.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And why &#383;o?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He that hath mi&#383;&#383;&#8217;d the Prince&#383;&#383;e, is a thing</LINE>
<LINE>Too bad, for bad report: and he that hath her,</LINE>
<LINE>(I meane, that married her, alacke good man,</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore banish&#8217;d) is a Creature, &#383;uch,</LINE>
<LINE>As to &#383;eeke through the Regions of the Earth</LINE>
<LINE>For one, his like; there would be &#383;omething failing</LINE>
<LINE>In him, that &#383;hould compare. I do not thinke,</LINE>
<LINE>So faire an Outward, and &#383;uch &#383;tuffe Within</LINE>
<LINE>Endowes a man, but hee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You &#383;peake him farre.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do extend him (Sir) within himselfe,</LINE>
<LINE>Crush him together, rather then vnfold</LINE>
<LINE>His measure duly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What's his name, and Birth?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I cannot delue him to the roote: His Father</LINE>
<LINE>Was call&#8217;d Sicillius, who did ioyne his Honor</LINE>
<LINE>Against the Romanes, with Ca&#383;&#383;ibulan,</LINE>
<LINE>But had his Titles by Tenantius, whom</LINE>
<LINE>He &#383;eru&#8217;d with Glory, and admir&#8217;d Succe&#383;&#383;e:</LINE>
<LINE>So gain&#8217;d the Sur-addition, Leonatus.</LINE>
<LINE>And had (besides this Gentleman in question)</LINE>
<LINE>Two other Sonnes, who in the Warres o'th&#8217; time</LINE>
<LINE>Dy&#8217;de with their Swords in hand. For which, their Father</LINE>
<LINE>Then old, and fond of y&#383;&#383;ue, tooke &#383;uch &#383;orrow</LINE>
<LINE>That he quit Being; and his gentle Lady</LINE>
<LINE>Bigge of this Gentleman (our Theame) deceast</LINE>
<LINE>As he was borne. The King he takes the Babe</LINE>
<LINE>To his protection, cals him Posthumus Leonatus,</LINE>
<LINE>Breedes him, and makes him of his Bed-chamber,</LINE>
<LINE>Puts to him all the Learnings that his time</LINE>
<LINE>Could make him the receiuer of, which he tooke</LINE>
<LINE>As we do ayre, fast as 'twas ministred,</LINE>
<LINE>And in's Spring, became a Haruest: Liu&#8217;d in Court</LINE>
<LINE>(Which rare it is to do) mo&#8217;t prais&#8217;d, mo&#8217;t lou&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>A &#383;ample to the yongest: to th&#8217; more Mature,</LINE>
<LINE>A gla&#383;&#383;e that feated them: and to the grauer,</LINE>
<LINE>A Childe that guided Dotards. To his Mistris,</LINE>
<LINE>(For whom he now is banish&#8217;d) her owne price</LINE>
<LINE>Proclaimes how &#383;he esteem&#8217;d him; and his Vertue</LINE>
<LINE>By her electio[n] may be truly read, what kind of man he is.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I honor him, euen out of your report.</LINE>
<LINE>But pray you tell me, is &#383;he &#383;ole childe to'th&#8217; King?</LINE>

<LINE>Marke it) the eldest of them, at three yeares old</LINE>
<LINE>I'th&#8217; &#383;wathing cloathes, the other from their Nursery</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Iach.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Beleeue it Sir, I haue &#383;eene him in Britaine; hee was then of a Cre&#383;&#383;ent note, expected to proue &#383;o woor-thy, as &#383;ince he hath beene allowed the name of. But I could then haue look&#8217;d on him, without the help of Ad-miration, though the Catalogue of his endowments had bin tabled by his &#383;ide, and I to peruse him by Items.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You &#383;peake of him when he was le&#383;&#383;e furnish&#8217;d, then now hee is, with that which makes him both with-out, and within.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>French.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I haue &#383;eene him in France: wee had very ma-ny there, could behold the Sunne, with as firme eyes as hee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Iach.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This matter of marrying his Kings Daughter, wherein he must be weighed rather by her valew, then his owne, words him (I doubt not) a great deale from the matter.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>French.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And then his banishment.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Iach.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I, and the approbation of those that weepe this lamentable diuorce vnder her colours, are wonderfully to extend him, be it but to fortifie her iudgement, which else an easie battery might lay flat, for taking a Begger without le&#383;&#383;e quality. But how comes it, he is to &#383;oiourne with you? How creepes acquaintance?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>His Father and I were Souldiers together, to whom I haue bin often bound for no le&#383;&#383;e then my life. <STAGEDIR>Enter Posthumus.</STAGEDIR> Heere comes the Britaine. Let him be &#383;o entertained a-mong'st you, as &#383;uites with Gentlemen of your knowing, to a Stranger of his quality. I beseech you all be better knowne to this Gentleman, whom I commend to you, as a Noble Friend of mine. How Worthy he is, I will leaue to appeare hereafter, rather then &#383;tory him in his owne hearing.</LINE>

<LINE>Since when, I haue bin debtor to you for courte-sies, which I will be euer to pay, and yet pay &#383;till.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>French.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, you o&#8217;re-rate my poore kindne&#383;&#383;e, I was glad I did attone my Countryman and you: it had beene pitty you &#383;hould haue beene put together, with &#383;o mor-tall a purpose, as then each bore, vpon importance of &#383;o &#383;light and triuiall a nature.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Post.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By your pardon Sir, I was then a young Trauel-ler, rather &#383;hun&#8217;d to go euen with what I heard, then in my euery action to be guided by others experiences: but vpon my mended iudgement (if I offend to &#383;ay it is men-ded) my Quarrell was not altogether &#383;light.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>French.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Faith yes, to be put to the arbiterment of Swords, and by &#383;uch two, that would by all likelyhood haue confounded one the other, or haue falne both.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Iach.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Can we with manners, aske what was the dif-ference?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>French.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Safely, I thinke, 'twas a contention in pub-licke, which may (without contradiction) &#383;uffer the re-port. It was much like an argument that fell out last night, where each of vs fell in praise of our Country-Mistre&#383;&#383;es. This Gentleman, at that time vouching (and vpon warrant of bloody affirmation) his to be more Faire, Vertuous, Wise, Chaste, Constant, Qualified, and le&#383;&#383;e attemptible then any, the rarest of our Ladies in Fraunce.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Iach.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That Lady is not now liuing; or this Gentle-mans opinion by this, worne out.</LINE>

<LINE>Being &#383;o farre prouok&#8217;d as I was in France: I would abate her nothing, though I profe&#383;&#383;e my &#383;elfe her Adorer, not her Friend.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Iach.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As faire, and as good: a kind of hand in hand comparison, had beene &#383;omething too faire, and too good for any Lady in Britanie; if &#383;he went before others. I haue &#383;eene as that Diamond of yours out-lusters many I haue beheld, I could not beleeue &#383;he excelled many: but I haue not &#383;eene the mo&#8217;t pretious Diamond that is, nor you the Lady.</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Post.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You are mistaken: the one may be &#383;olde or gi-uen, or if there were wealth enough for the purchases, or merite for the guift. The other is not a thing for &#383;ale, and onely the guift of the Gods.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Iach.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You may weare her in title yours: but you know &#383;trange Fowle light vpon neighbouring Ponds. Your Ring may be &#383;tolne too, &#383;o your brace of vnprizea-ble Estimations, the one is but fraile, and the other Casu-all; A cunning Thiefe, or a (that way) accomplish&#8217;d Courtier, would hazzard the winning both of first and last.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>Post.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your Italy, containes none &#383;o accomplish&#8217;d a Courtier to conuince the Honour of my Mistris: if in the holding or lo&#383;&#383;e of that, you terme her fraile, I do no-thing doubt you haue &#383;tore of Theeues, notwithstanding I feare not my Ring.</LINE>

<LINE>No, no.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Iach.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I dare thereupon pawne the moytie of my E-state, to your Ring, which in my opinion o&#8217;re-values it &#383;omething: but I make my wager rather against your Confidence, then her Reputation. And to barre your of-fence heerein to, I durst attempt it against any Lady in the world.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Qu.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That opportunity</LINE>
<LINE>Which then they had to take from's, to resume</LINE>
<LINE>We haue againe. Remember Sir, my Liege,</LINE>
<LINE>The Kings your Ancestors, together with</LINE>
<LINE>The naturall brauery of your Isle, which &#383;tands</LINE>
<LINE>As Neptunes Parke, ribb&#8217;d, and pal&#8217;d in</LINE>
<LINE>With Oakes vnskaleable, and roaring Waters,</LINE>
<LINE>With Sands that will not beare your Enemies Boates,</LINE>
<LINE>But &#383;ucke them vp to'th&#8217; Top-mast. A kinde of Conquest</LINE>
<LINE>Caesar made heere, but made not heere his bragge</LINE>
<LINE>Of Came, and Saw, and Ouer-came: with &#383;hame</LINE>
<LINE>(The first that euer touch&#8217;d him) he was carried</LINE>
<LINE>From off our Coast, twice beaten: and his Shipping</LINE>
<LINE>(Poore ignorant Baubles) on our terrible Seas</LINE>
<LINE>Like Egge-shels mou&#8217;d vpon their Surges, crack&#8217;d</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Cym.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You must know,</LINE>

<LINE>Did put the yoake vpon's; which to &#383;hake off</LINE>
<LINE>Becomes a warlike people, whom we reckon</LINE>
<LINE>Our &#383;elues to be, we do. Say then to Caesar,</LINE>
<LINE>Our Ancestor was that Mulmutius, which</LINE>
<LINE>Ordain&#8217;d our Lawes, whose vse the Sword of Caesar</LINE>
<LINE>Hath too much mangled; whose repayre, and franchise,</LINE>
<LINE>Shall (by the power we hold) be our good deed,</LINE>
<LINE>Tho Rome be therfore angry. Mulmutius made our lawes</LINE>
<LINE>Who was the first of Britaine, which did put</LINE>
