<LINE>This yong Gentlewoman had a father, O that</LINE>

<LINE>great as his hone&#383;tie, had it &#383;tretch&#8217;d &#383;o far, would haue </LINE>
<LINE>made nature immortall, and death &#383;hould haue play for</LINE>

<SPEAKER>Mo.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He was famous &#383;ir in his profe&#383;&#383;ion, and it was</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Laf.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He was excellent indeed Madam, the King very</LINE> 
<LINE>latelie &#383;poke of him admiringly, and mourningly: hee</LINE> 
<LINE>was skilfull enough to haue liu&#8217;d &#383;til, if knowledge could</LINE>

<SPEAKER>Mo.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>His &#383;ole childe my Lord, and bequeathed to my</LINE>

<LINE>education promi&#383;es her di&#383;po&#383;itions &#383;hee inherits,</LINE> 
<LINE>which makes faire gifts fairer: for where an vncleane mind car-</LINE>
<LINE>ries vertuous qualities, there commendations go with</LINE>

<LINE>the better for their &#383;implene&#383;&#383;e; &#383;he deriues her hone&#383;tie,</LINE>

<SPEAKER>Mo.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis the be&#383;t brine a Maiden can &#383;ea&#383;on her prai&#383;e</LINE>
<LINE>in. The remembrance of her father neuer approches her</LINE> 
<LINE>heart, but the tirrany of her &#383;orrowes takes all liuelihood</LINE> 
<LINE>from her cheeke. No more of this <NAMEREF>Helena</NAMEREF>, go too, no</LINE>

<LINE>O were that all, I thinke not on my father,</LINE>
<LINE>And the&#383;e great teares grace his remembrance more</LINE>
<LINE>Then tho&#383;e I &#383;hed for him. What was he like?</LINE>

<LINE>I am vndone, there is no liuing, none,</LINE>
<LINE>If <NAMEREF>Bertram</NAMEREF> be away. &#8217;Twere all one,</LINE>

<LINE>Mu&#383;t I be comforted, not in his &#383;phere;</LINE>
<LINE>Th&#8217; ambition in my loue thus plagues it &#383;elfe:</LINE>
<LINE>The hind that would be mated by the Lion</LINE>
<LINE>Mu&#383;t die for loue. &#8217;Twas prettie, though a plague</LINE>
<LINE>To &#383;ee him euerie houre to &#383;it and draw</LINE>

<LINE>In our hearts table: heart too capeable</LINE>
<LINE>Of euerie line and tricke of his &#383;weet fauour.</LINE>
<LINE>But now he's gone, and my idolatrous fancie</LINE>

<LINE><STAGEDIR>Enter Parrolles.</STAGEDIR></LINE>
<LINE>One that goes with him: I loue him for his &#383;ake,</LINE>
<LINE>And yet I know him a notorious Liar,</LINE>
<LINE>Thinke him a great way foole, &#383;olie a coward,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet the&#383;e fixt euils &#383;it &#383;o fit in him,</LINE>
<LINE>That they take place, when Vertues &#383;teely bones</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Par.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Saue you faire Queene.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Hel.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And you Monarch.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Par.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Hel.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And no.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Par.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Are you meditating on virginitie?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Hel.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I: you haue &#383;ome &#383;taine of &#383;ouldier in you: Let</LINE> 
<LINE>mee aske you a que&#383;tion. Man is enemie to virginitie,</LINE>
<LINE>how may we barracado it again&#383;t him?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Par.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Keepe him out.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Hel.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But he a&#383;&#383;ailes, and our virginitie though vali-</LINE>
<LINE>ant, in the defence yet is weak: vnfold to vs &#383;ome war-</LINE>
<LINE>like re&#383;i&#383;tance.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Par.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There is none: Man &#383;etting downe before you,</LINE>
<LINE>will vndermine you, and blow you vp.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Hel.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ble&#383;&#383;e our poore Virginity from vnderminers</LINE>
<LINE>and blowers vp. Is there no Military policy how Vir-</LINE>
<LINE>gins might blow vp men?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Par.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Virginity beeing blowne downe, Man will</LINE> 
<LINE>quicklier be blowne vp: marry in blowing him downe</LINE> 
<LINE>againe, with the breach your &#383;elues made, you lo&#383;e your</LINE> 
<LINE>Citty. It is not politicke, in the Common-wealth of</LINE> 
<LINE>Nature, to pre&#383;erue virginity. Lo&#383;&#383;e of Virginitie, is</LINE> 
<LINE>rationall encrea&#383;e, and there was neuer Virgin g&#339;, till</LINE> 
<LINE>virginitie was fir&#383;t lo&#383;t. That you were made of, is met-</LINE>
<LINE>tall to make Virgins. Virginitie, by beeing once lo&#383;t,</LINE> 
<LINE>may be ten times found: by being euer kept, it is euer</LINE> 
<LINE>lo&#383;t: &#8216;tis too cold a companion: Away with&#8217;t.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Hel.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will &#383;tand for&#8217;t a little, though therefore I die</LINE>
<LINE>a Virgin.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Par.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There&#8217;s little can bee &#383;aide in&#8217;t, &#8217;tis again&#383;t the</LINE>
<LINE>rule of Nature. To &#383;peake on the part of virginitie, is</LINE>
<LINE>to accu&#383;e your Mothers; which is mo&#8217;t infallible di&#383;o-</LINE>
<LINE>bedience. He that hangs him&#383;elfe is a Virgin: Virgini-</LINE>
<LINE>tie murthers it &#383;elfe, and &#383;hould be buried in highwayes</LINE> 
<LINE>out of all &#383;an&#392;tified limit, as a de&#383;perate Offendre&#383;&#383;e a-</LINE>
<LINE>gain&#383;t Nature. Virginitie breedes mites, much like a</LINE>
<LINE>Chee&#383;e, con&#383;umes it &#383;elfe to the very payring, and &#383;o</LINE> 
<LINE>dies with feeding his owne &#383;tomacke. Be&#383;ides, Virgini-</LINE>
<LINE>tie is peeui&#383;h, proud, ydle, made of &#383;elfe-loue, which</LINE>
<LINE>which is the mo&#383;t inhibited &#383;inne in the Cannon. Keepe it not,</LINE>
<LINE>you cannot choo&#383;e but loo&#383;e by&#8217;t. Out with&#8217;t: within</LINE> 
<LINE>ten yeare it will make it &#383;elfe two, which is a goodly in-</LINE>
<LINE>crea&#383;e, and the principall it &#383;elfe not much the wor&#383;e.</LINE> 
<LINE>Away with&#8217;t.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Hel.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How might one do &#383;ir, to loo&#383;e it to her owne</LINE> 
<LINE>liking?</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Par.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let mee &#383;ee. Marry ill, to like him that ne&#8217;re</LINE>
<LINE>it likes. &#8217;Tis a commodity wil lose the glo&#383;&#383;e with lying:</LINE>
<LINE>The longer kept, the le&#383;&#383;e worth: Off with&#8217;t while &#8217;tis</LINE>
<LINE>vendible. An&#383;wer the time of reque&#383;t, Virginitie like</LINE> 
<LINE>an olde Courtier, weares her cap out of fa&#383;hion, richly</LINE>
<LINE>&#383;uted, but vn&#383;uteable, iu&#383;t like the brooch &amp; the tooth-</LINE>
<LINE>pick, which were not now: your Date is better in your</LINE> 
<LINE>Pye and your Porredge, then in your cheeke: and your</LINE>
<LINE>virginity, your old virginity, is like one of our French</LINE>
<LINE>wither&#8217;d peares, it lookes ill, it eates drily, marry &#8217;tis a</LINE> 
<LINE>wither&#8217;d peare: it was formerly better, marry yet &#8217;tis a</LINE>
<LINE>wither&#8217;d peare: Will you any thing with it?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Hel.</SPEAKER>

<LINE>There &#383;hall your Ma&#383;ter haue a thou&#383;and loues,</LINE>
<LINE>A Mother, and a Mi&#383;tre&#383;&#383;e, and a friend,</LINE>
<LINE>A Phenix, Captaine, and an enemy,</LINE>
<LINE>A guide, a Godde&#383;&#383;e, and a Soueraigne,</LINE>
<LINE>A Coun&#383;ellor, a Traitore&#383;&#383;e, and a Deare:</LINE>
<LINE>His humble ambition, proud humility:</LINE>
<LINE>His iarring, concord: and his di&#383;cord, dulcet:</LINE>
<LINE>His faith, his &#383;weet di&#383;a&#383;ter: with a world</LINE>
