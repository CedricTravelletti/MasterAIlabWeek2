<LINE>Is not &#383;o long as is a tedious tale.</LINE>
<LINE><NAMEREF>Romeo</NAMEREF> there dead, was husband to that <NAMEREF>Iuliet</NAMEREF>,</LINE>
<LINE>And &#383;he there dead, that&#8217;s <NAMEREF>Romeos</NAMEREF> faithfull wife:</LINE>
<LINE>I married them; and their &#383;tolne marriage day</LINE>
<LINE>Was <NAMEREF>Tybalts</NAMEREF> Doome&#383;day: who&#383;e vntimely death</LINE>
<LINE>Bani&#383;h&#8217;d the new-made Bridegroome from this Citie:</LINE>
<LINE>For whom (and not for <NAMEREF>Tybalt</NAMEREF>) <NAMEREF>Iuliet</NAMEREF> pinde.</LINE>
<LINE>You, to remoue that &#383;iege of Greefe from her,</LINE>
<LINE>Betroth&#8217;d, and would haue married her perforce</LINE>
<LINE>To Countie <NAMEREF>Paris</NAMEREF>. Then comes &#383;he to me,</LINE>
<LINE>And (with wilde lookes) bid me deui&#383;e &#383;ome meanes</LINE>
<LINE>To rid her from this &#383;econd Marriage,</LINE>
<LINE>Or in my Cell there would &#383;he kill her &#383;elfe.</LINE>
<LINE>Then gaue I her (so Tutor&#8217;d by my Art)</LINE>
<LINE>A &#383;leeping Potion, which &#383;o tooke effe&#392;t</LINE>
<LINE>As I intended, for it wrought on her</LINE>
<LINE>The forme of death. Meane time, I writ to <NAMEREF>Romeo</NAMEREF>,</LINE>

<LINE>To helpe to take her from her borrowed graue,</LINE>
<LINE>Being the time the Potions force &#383;hould cea&#383;e.</LINE>
<LINE>But he which bore my Letter, Frier <NAMEREF>Iohn</NAMEREF>,</LINE>
<LINE>Was &#383;tay&#8217;d by accident; and ye&#383;ternight</LINE>
<LINE>Return&#8217;d my Letter backe. Then all alone,</LINE>
<LINE>At the prefixed houre of her waking,</LINE>
<LINE>Came I to take her from her Kindreds vault,</LINE>
<LINE>Meaning to keepe her clo&#383;ely at my Cell,</LINE>
<LINE>Till I conueniently could &#383;end to <NAMEREF>Romeo</NAMEREF>.</LINE>

<LINE>And &#383;he (too de&#383;perate) would not go with me,</LINE>
<LINE>But (as it &#383;eemes) did violence on her &#383;elfe.</LINE>
<LINE>All this I know, and to the Marriage her Nur&#383;e is priuy:</LINE>
<LINE>And if ought in this mi&#383;carried by my fault,</LINE>
<LINE>Let my old life be &#383;acrific&#8217;d, &#383;ome houre before the time,</LINE>
<LINE>Vnto the rigour of &#383;euere&#383;t Law.</LINE>
