<line>What? did my brother Henry &#383;pend his youth,</line>
<line>His valour, coine, and people in the warres?</line>
<line>Did he &#383;o often lodge in open field:</line>
<line>In Winters cold, and Summers parching heate,</line>
<line>To conquer France, his true inheritance?</line>
<line>And did my brother Bedford toyle his wits,</line>
<line>To keepe by policy what Henrie got:</line>
<line>Haue you your &#383;elues, Somerset, Buckingham,</line>
<line>Braue Yorke, Salisbury, and victorious Warwicke,</line>
<line>Receiud deepe &#383;carres in France and Normandie:</line>

<line>With all the Learned Counsell of the Realme,</line>
<line>Studied &#383;o long, &#383;at in the Councell house,</line>
<line>Early and late, debating too and fro</line>
<line>How France and Frenchmen might be kept in awe,</line>
<line>And hath his Highne&#383;&#383;e in his infancie,</line>
<line>Crowned in Paris in despight of f&#339;s,</line>
<line>And &#383;hall these Labours, and these Honours dye?</line>
<line>Shall Henries Conquest, Bedfords vigilance,</line>
<line>Your Deeds of Warre, and all our Counsell dye?</line>
<line>O Peeres of England, &#383;hamefull is this League,</line>
<line>Fatall this Marriage, cancelling your Fame,</line>
<line>Blotting your names from Bookes of memory,</line>

<line>That dims the Honor of this Warlike Isle:</line>
<line>France &#383;hould haue torne and rent my very hart,</line>
<line>Before I would haue yeelded to this League.</line>
<line>I neuer read but Englands Kings haue had</line>
<line>Large &#383;ummes of Gold, and Dowries with their wiues,</line>
<line>And our King Henry giues away his owne,</line>
<line>To match with her that brings no vantages.</line>

<line>But &#8216;tis my presence that doth trouble ye,</line>
<line>Rancour will out, proud Prelate, in thy face</line>

<line>So, there goes our Protector in a rage:</line>
<line>&#8216;Tis knowne to you he is mine enemy:</line>
<line>Nay more, an enemy vnto you all,</line>
<line>And no great friend, I feare me to the King;</line>
<line>Consider Lords, he is the next of blood,</line>
<line>And heyre apparant to the English Crowne:</line>
<line>Had Henrie got an Empire by his marriage,</line>
<line>And all the wealthy Kingdomes of the West,</line>
<line>There's reason he &#383;hould be displeas&#8217;d at it:</line>
<line>Looke to it Lords, let not his &#383;moothing words</line>
<line>Bewitch your hearts, be wise and circumspect.</line>
<line>What though the common people fauour him,</line>
<line>Calling him, Humfrey the good Duke of Gloster,</line>
<line>Clapping their hands, and crying with loud voyce,</line>
<line>Iesu maintaine your Royall Excellence,</line>
<line>With God preserue the good Duke Humfrey:</line>
<line>I feare me Lords, for all this flattering glo&#383;&#383;e,</line>
<line>He will be found a dangerous Protector.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Buc.</speaker>
<line>Why &#383;hould he then protect our Soueraigne?</line>
<line>He being of age to gouerne of himselfe.</line>
<line>Cosin of Somerset, ioyne you with me,</line>
<line>And altogether with the Duke of Suffolke,</line>
<line>Wee'l quickly hoyse Duke Humfrey from his &#383;eat.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Som.</speaker>
<line>Cosin of Buckingham, though Humfries pride</line>
<line>And greatne&#383;&#383;e of his place be greefe to vs,</line>
<line>Yet let vs watch the haughtie Cardinall,</line>
<line>His insolence is more intollerable</line>
<line>Then all the Princes in the Land beside,</line>
<line>If Gloster be displac&#8217;d, hee'l be Protector.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Buc.</speaker>
<line>Or thou, or I Somerset will be Protectors,</line>
<line>Despite Duke Humfrey, or the Cardinall.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit Buckingham, and Somerset.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>Sal.</speaker>
<line>Pride went before, Ambition followes him.</line>
<line>While these do labour for their owne preferment,</line>
<line>Behooues it vs to labor for the Realme.</line>
<line>I neuer &#383;aw but Humfrey Duke of Gloster,</line>
<line>Did beare him like a Noble Gentleman:</line>
<line>Oft haue I &#383;eene the haughty Cardinall,</line>
<line>More like a Souldier then a man o'th&#8217; Church,</line>
<line>As &#383;tout and proud as he were Lord of all,</line>
<line>Sweare like a Ruffian, and demeane himselfe</line>
<line>Vnlike the Ruler of a Common-weale.</line>
<line>Warwicke my &#383;onne, the comfort of my age,</line>
<line>Thy deeds, thy plainne&#383;&#383;e, and thy house-keeping,</line>
<line>Hath wonne the greatest fauour of the Commons,</line>
<line>Excepting none but good Duke Humfrey.</line>
<line>And Brother Yorke, thy Acts in Ireland,</line>
<line>In bringing them to ciuill Discipline:</line>
<line>Thy late exploits done in the heart of France,</line>
<line>When thou wert Regent for our Soueraigne,</line>
<line>Haue made thee fear&#8217;d and honor&#8217;d of the people,</line>
<line>Ioyne we together for the publike good,</line>
<line>In what we can, to bridle and &#383;uppre&#383;&#383;e</line>
<line>The pride of Suffolke, and the Cardinall,</line>
<line>With Somersets and Buckinghams Ambition,</line>
<line>And as we may, cherish Duke Humfries deeds,</line>
<line>While they do tend the profit of the Land.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>War.</speaker>
<line>So God helpe Warwicke, as he loues the Land,</line>
<line>And common profit of his Countrey.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Yor.</speaker>
<line>And &#383;o &#383;ayes Yorke,</line>
<line>For he hath greatest cause.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Salisbury.</speaker>
<line>Then lets make hast away,</line>
<line>And looke vnto the maine.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Warwicke.</speaker>
<line>Vnto the maine?</line>
<line>Oh Father, Maine is lost,</line>
<line>That Maine, which by maine force Warwicke did winne,</line>
<line>And would haue kept, &#383;o long as breath did last:</line>
<line>Main-chance father you meant, but I meant Maine,</line>
<line>Which I will win from France, or else be &#383;laine.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit Warwicke, and Salisbury. Manet Yorke.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>Yorke.</speaker>
<line>Aniou and Maine are giuen to the French,</line>
<line>Paris is lost, the &#383;tate of Normandie</line>
<line>Stands on a tickle point, now they are gone:</line>
<line>Suffolke concluded on the Articles,</line>
<line>The Peeres agreed, and Henry was well pleas&#8217;d,</line>
<line>To change two Dukedomes for a Dukes faire daughter.</line>
<line>I cannot blame them all, what is't to them?</line>
<line>&#8216;Tis thine they giue away, and not their owne.</line>
<line>Pirates may make cheape penyworths of their pillage,</line>
<line>And purchase Friends, and giue to Curtezans,</line>
<line>Still reuelling like Lords till all be gone,</line>
<line>While as the &#383;illy Owner of the goods</line>
<line>Weepes ouer them, and wrings his haple&#383;&#383;e hands,</line>
<line>And &#383;hakes his head, and trembling &#383;tands aloofe,</line>
<line>While all is &#383;har&#8217;d, and all is borne away,</line>
<line>Ready to &#383;terue, and dare not touch his owne.</line>
<line>So Yorke must &#383;it, and fret, and bite his tongue,</line>
<line>While his owne Lands are bargain&#8217;d for, and &#383;old:</line>
<line>Me thinkes the Realmes of England, France, &amp; Ireland,</line>
<line>Beare that proportion to my flesh and blood,</line>
<line>As did the fatall brand Althaea burnt,</line>
<line>Vnto the Princes heart of Calidon:</line>
<line>Aniou and Maine both giuen vnto the French?</line>
<line>Cold newes for me: for I had hope of France,</line>
<line>Euen as I haue of fertile Englands &#383;oile.</line>
<line>A day will come, when Yorke &#383;hall claime his owne,</line>
<line>And therefore I will take the Neuils parts,</line>
<line>And make a &#383;hew of loue to proud Duke Humfrey,</line>
<line>And when I &#383;py aduantage, claime the Crowne,</line>
<line>For that&#8217;s the Golden marke I &#383;eeke to hit:</line>
<line>Nor &#383;hall proud Lancaster vsurpe my right,</line>
<line>Nor hold the Scepter in his childish Fist,</line>
<line>Nor weare the Diadem vpon his head,</line>
<line>Whose Church-like humors fits not for a Crowne.</line>
<line>Then Yorke be &#383;till a-while, till time do &#383;erue:</line>
<line>Watch thou, and wake when others be asleepe,</line>
<line>To prie into the &#383;ecrets of the State,</line>
<line>Till Henrie &#383;urfetting in ioyes of loue,</line>
<line>With his new Bride, &amp; Englands deere bought Queen,</line>
<line>And Humfrey with the Peeres be falne at iarres:</line>
<line>Then will I raise aloft the Milke-white-Rose,</line>
<line>With whose &#383;weet &#383;mell the Ayre &#383;hall be perfum&#8217;d,</line>
<line>And in my Standard beare the Armes of Yorke,</line>
<line>To grapple with the house of Lancaster,</line>
<line>And force perforce Ile make him yeeld the Crowne,</line>
<line>Whose bookish Rule, hath pull&#8217;d faire England downe.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit Yorke.</stagedir>

<stagedir>Enter Duke Humfrey and his wife Elianor.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>Elia.</speaker>
<line>Why droopes my Lord like ouer-ripen&#8217;d Corn,</line>
<line>Hanging the head at Ceres plenteous load?</line>
<line>Why doth the Great Duke Humfrey knit his browes,</line>
<line>As frowning at the Fauours of the world?</line>
<line>Why are thine eyes fixt to the &#383;ullen earth,</line>
<line>Gazing on that which &#383;eemes to dimme thy &#383;ight?</line>

<line>Put forth thy hand, reach at the glorious Gold.</line>
<line>What, is't too &#383;hort? Ile lengthen it with mine,</line>
<line>And hauing both together heau&#8217;d it vp,</line>
<line>Wee'l both together lift our heads to heauen,</line>
<line>And neuer more abase our &#383;ight &#383;o low,</line>
<line>As to vouchsafe one glance vnto the ground.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Hum.</speaker>
<line>O Nell, &#383;weet Nell, if thou dost loue thy Lord,</line>
<line>Banish the Canker of ambitious thoughts:</line>
<line>And may that thought, when I imagine ill</line>
<line>Against my King and Nephew, vertuous Henry,</line>

<line>My troublous dreames this night, doth make me &#383;ad.</line>

<line>This was my dreame, what it doth bode God knowes.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Eli.</speaker>

<line>In Courage, Courtship, and Proportion:</line>

So let her rest: and Madame list to me, For I am bold to counsaile you in this; Although we fancie not the Cardinall, Yet must we ioyne with him and with the Lords, Till we haue brought Duke Humphrey in disgrace. As for the Duke of Yorke, this late Complaint Will make but little for his benefit: So one by one wee'le weed them all at last, And you your &#383;elfe &#383;hall &#383;teere the happy Helme. <stagedir>Exit.</stagedir> <stagedir>Sound a Sennet.</stagedir></line>

<line>First note, that he is neere you in discent,</line>

<line>Whiles I in Ireland nourish a mightie Band,</line>
<line>I will &#383;tirre vp in England &#383;ome black Storme,</line>
<line>Shall blowe ten thousand Soules to Heauen, or Hell:</line>
<line>And this fell Tempest &#383;hall not cease to rage,</line>
<line>Vntill the Golden Circuit on my Head,</line>
<line>Like to the glorious Sunnes transparant Beames,</line>
<line>Doe calme the furie of this mad-bred Flawe.</line>

<line>Were almost like a &#383;harpe-quill&#8217;d Porpentine:</line>
<line>And in the end being rescued, I haue &#383;eene</line>
<line>Him capre vpright, like a wilde Morisco,</line>
<line>Shaking the bloody Darts, as he his Bells.</line>
<line>Full often, like a &#383;hag-hayr&#8217;d craftie Kerne,</line>

<line>This Deuill here &#383;hall be my &#383;ubstitute;</line>
<line>For that Iohn Mortimer, which now is dead,</line>
<line>In face, in gate, in &#383;peech he doth resemble.</line>
<line>By this, I &#383;hall perceiue the Commons minde,</line>
<line>How they affect the House and Clayme of Yorke.</line>
<line>Say he be taken, rackt, and tortured;</line>
<line>I know, no paine they can inflict vpon him,</line>
<line>Will make him &#383;ay, I mou&#8217;d him to those Armes.</line>
<line>Say that he thriue, as &#8216;tis great like he will,</line>
<line>Why then from Ireland come I with my &#383;trength,</line>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>What, doth my Lord of Suffolke comfort me?</line>
<line>Came he right now to &#383;ing a Rauens Note,</line>
<line>Whose dismall tune bereft my Vitall powres:</line>
<line>And thinkes he, that the chirping of a Wren,</line>
<line>By crying comfort from a hollow breast,</line>
<line>Can chase away the first-conceiued &#383;ound?</line>
<line>Hide not thy poyson with &#383;uch &#383;ugred words,</line>
<line>Lay not thy hands on me: forbeare I &#383;ay,</line>
<line>Their touch affrights me as a Serpents &#383;ting.</line>
<line>Thou balefull Me&#383;&#383;enger, out of my &#383;ight:</line>

<line>Sits in grim Maiestie, to fright the World.</line>
<line>Looke not vpon me, for thine eyes are wounding;</line>
<line>Yet doe not goe away: come Basiliske,</line>

<line>For in the &#383;hade of death, I &#383;hall finde ioy;</line>
<line>In life, but double death, now Gloster's dead.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Queene.</speaker>
<line>Why do you rate my Lord of Suffolke thus?</line>
<line>Although the Duke was enemie to him,</line>
<line>Yet he mo&#8217;t Christian-like laments his death:</line>
<line>And for my &#383;elfe, F&#339; as he was to me,</line>
<line>Might liquid teares, or heart-offending groanes,</line>
<line>Or blood-consuming &#383;ighes recall his Life;</line>
<line>I would be blinde with weeping, &#383;icke with grones,</line>
<line>Looke pale as Prim-rose with blood-drinking &#383;ighes,</line>
<line>And all to haue the Noble Duke aliue.</line>
<line>What know I how the world may deeme of me?</line>
<line>For it is knowne we were but hollow Friends:</line>
<line>It may be iudg&#8217;d I made the Duke away,</line>
<line>So &#383;hall my name with Slanders tongue be wounded,</line>
<line>And Princes Courts be fill&#8217;d with my reproach:</line>

<line>I am no loathsome Leaper, looke on me.</line>
<line>What? Art thou like the Adder waxen deafe?</line>
<line>Be poysonous too, and kill thy forlorne Queene.</line>
<line>Is all thy comfort &#383;hut in Glosters Tombe?</line>
<line>Why then Dame Elianor was neere thy ioy.</line>
<line>Erect his Statue, and worship it,</line>
<line>And make my Image but an Ale-house &#383;igne.</line>
<line>Was I for this nye wrack&#8217;d vpon the Sea,</line>
<line>And twice by aukward winde from Englands banke</line>
<line>Droue backe againe vnto my Natiue Clime.</line>
<line>What boaded this? but well fore-warning winde</line>
<line>Did &#383;eeme to &#383;ay, &#383;eeke not a Scorpions Nest,</line>
<line>Nor &#383;et no footing on this vnkinde Shore.</line>
<line>What did I then? But curst the gentle gusts,</line>
<line>And he that loos&#8217;d them forth their Brazen Caues,</line>
<line>And bid them blow towards Englands ble&#383;&#383;ed &#383;hore,</line>
<line>Or turne our Sterne vpon a dreadfull Rocke:</line>
<line>Yet Aeolus would not be a murtherer,</line>
<line>But left that hatefull office vnto thee.</line>
<line>The pretty vaulting Sea refus&#8217;d to drowne me,</line>
<line>Knowing that thou wouldst haue me drown&#8217;d on &#383;hore</line>
<line>With teares as &#383;alt as Sea, through thy vnkindne&#383;&#383;e.</line>
<line>The &#383;plitting Rockes cowr&#8217;d in the &#383;inking &#383;ands,</line>
<line>And would not dash me with their ragged &#383;ides,</line>
<line>Because thy flinty heart more hard then they,</line>
<line>Might in thy Pallace, perish Elianor.</line>
<line>As farre as I could ken thy Chalky Cliffes,</line>
<line>When from thy Shore, the Tempest beate vs backe,</line>
<line>I &#383;tood vpon the Hatches in the &#383;torme:</line>
<line>And when the duskie &#383;ky, began to rob</line>
<line>My earnest-gaping-&#383;ight of thy Lands view,</line>
<line>I tooke a costly Iewell from my necke,</line>
<line>A Hart it was bound in with Diamonds,</line>
<line>And threw it towards thy Land: The Sea receiu&#8217;d it,</line>
<line>And &#383;o I wish&#8217;d thy body might my Heart:</line>
<line>And euen with this, I lost faire Englands view,</line>
<line>And bid mine eyes be packing with my Heart,</line>
<line>And call&#8217;d them blinde and duskie Spectacles,</line>
<line>For loosing ken of Albions wished Coast.</line>
<line>How often haue I tempted Suffolkes tongue</line>
<line>(The agent of thy foule inconstancie)</line>
<line>To &#383;it and watch me as Ascanius did,</line>
<line>When he to madding Dido would vnfold</line>
<line>His Fathers Acts, commenc&#8217;d in burning Troy.</line>
<line>Am I not witcht like her? Or thou not false like him?</line>
<line>Aye me, I can no more: Dye Elinor,</line>
<line>For Henry weepes, that thou dost liue &#383;o long.</line>

<line>See how the blood is &#383;etled in his face.</line>
<line>Oft haue I &#383;eene a timely-parted Gho&#383;t,</line>
<line>Of ashy &#383;emblance, meager, pale, and bloodle&#383;&#383;e,</line>
<line>Being all descended to the labouring heart,</line>
<line>Who in the Conflict that it holds with death,</line>
<line>Attracts the &#383;ame for aydance 'gainst the enemy,</line>
<line>Which with the heart there cooles, and ne're returneth,</line>
<line>To blush and beautifie the Cheeke againe.</line>
<line>But &#383;ee, his face is blacke, and full of blood:</line>
<line>His eye-balles further out, than when he liued,</line>
<line>Staring full gastly, like a &#383;trangled man:</line>
<line>His hayre vprear&#8217;d, his nostrils &#383;tretcht with &#383;trugling:</line>
<line>His hands abroad display&#8217;d, as one that graspt</line>
<line>And tugg&#8217;d for Life, and was by &#383;trength &#383;ubdude.</line>
<line>Looke on the &#383;heets his haire (you &#383;ee) is &#383;ticking,</line>
<line>His well proportion&#8217;d Beard, made ruffe and rugged,</line>

<line>Sirs &#383;tand apart, the King &#383;hall know your minde. Dread Lord, the Commons &#383;end you word by me, Vnle&#383;&#383;e Lord Suffolke &#383;traight be done to death, Or banished faire Englands Territories, They will by violence teare him from your Pallace, And torture him with grieuous lingring death. They &#383;ay, by him the good Duke Humfrey dy&#8217;de: They &#383;ay, in him they feare your Highne&#383;&#383;e death; And meere instinct of Loue and Loyaltie, Free from a &#383;tubborne opposite intent, As being thought to contradict your liking, Makes them thus forward in his Banishment. They &#383;ay, in care of your mo&#8217;t Royall Person, That if your Highne&#383;&#383;e &#383;hould intend to &#383;leepe, And charge, that no man &#383;hould disturbe your rest, In paine of your dislike, or paine of death; Yet not withstanding &#383;uch a &#383;trait Edict, Were there a Serpent &#383;eene, with forked Tongue, That &#383;lyly glyded towards your Maiestie, It were but nece&#383;&#383;arie you were wak't: Least being &#383;uffer&#8217;d in that harmefull &#383;lumber, The mortall Worme might make the &#383;leepe eternall. And therefore doe they cry, though you forbid, That they will guard you, where you will, or no, From &#383;uch fell Serpents as false Suffolke is; With whose inuenomed and fatall &#383;ting, Your louing Vnckle, twentie times his worth, They &#383;ay is &#383;hamefully bereft of life. Commons within. An an&#383;wer from the King, my Lord of Salisbury.</line>

<line>But all the Honor Salisbury hath wonne,</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Suf.</speaker>
<line>A plague vpon them: wherefore &#383;hould I cur&#383;&#383;e them? Would curses kill, as doth the Mandrakes grone, I would inuent as bitter &#383;earching termes, As curst, as harsh, and horrible to heare, Deliuer&#8217;d &#383;trongly through my fixed teeth, With full as many &#383;ignes of deadly hate, As leane-fac&#8217;d enuy in her loathsome caue. My tongue &#383;hould &#383;tumble in mine earnest words, Mine eyes &#383;hould &#383;parkle like the beaten Flint, Mine haire be fixt an end, as one distract: I, euery ioynt &#383;hould &#383;eeme to curse and ban, And euen now my burthen&#8217;d heart would breake Should I not curse them. Poyson be their drinke. Gall, worse then Gall, the daintiest that they taste: Their &#383;weetest &#383;hade, a groue of Cypre&#383;&#383;e Trees: Their cheefest Prospect, murd'ring Basiliskes: Their &#383;oftest Touch, as &#383;mart as Lyzards &#383;tings: Their Musicke, frightfull as the Serpents hi&#383;&#383;e, And boading Screech-Owles, make the Consort full. All the foule terrors in darke &#383;eated hell &#8212;</line>

<line>And turnes the force of them vpon thy &#383;elfe.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Suf.</speaker>
<line>You bad me ban, and will you bid me leaue?</line>
<line>Now by the ground that I am banish&#8217;d from,</line>
<line>Well could I curse away a Winters night,</line>
<line>Though &#383;tanding naked on a Mountaine top,</line>
<line>Where byting cold would neuer let gra&#383;&#383;e grow,</line>
<line>And thinke it but a minute &#383;pent in &#383;port.</line>

<line>Oh, let me intreat thee cease, giue me thy hand,</line>

<line>Nor let the raine of heauen wet this place,</line>
<line>To wash away my wofull Monuments.</line>
<line>Oh, could this ki&#383;&#383;e be printed in thy hand,</line>
<line>That thou might'st thinke vpon these by the Seale,</line>
<line>Through whom a thousand &#383;ighes are breath&#8217;d for thee.</line>
<line>So get thee gone, that I may know my greefe,</line>
<line>&#8216;Tis but &#383;urmiz&#8217;d, whiles thou art &#383;tanding by,</line>
<line>As one that &#383;urfets, thinking on a want:</line>
<line>I will repeale thee, or be well a&#383;&#383;ur&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Aduenture to be banished my &#383;elfe:</line>
<line>And banished I am, if but from thee.</line>
<line>Go, &#383;peake not to me; euen now be gone.</line>
<line>Oh go not yet. Euen thus, two Friends condemn&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Embrace, and ki&#383;&#383;e, and take ten thousand leaues,</line>
<line>Loather a hundred times to part then dye;</line>
<line>Yet now farewell, and farewell Life with thee.</line>

<speaker>Suf.</speaker>
<line>Thus is poore Suffolke ten times banished,</line>
<line>Once by the King, and three times thrice by thee.</line>
<line>&#8216;Tis not the Land I care for, wer't thou thence,</line>
<line>A Wilderne&#383;&#383;e is populous enough,</line>

<line>With euery &#383;euerall pleasure in the World:</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Cade.</speaker>
<line>My Father was a Mortimer.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>But.</speaker>
<line>He was an hone&#383;t man, and a good Bricklayer.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Cade.</speaker>
<line>My mother a Plantagenet.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Butch.</speaker>
<line>I knew her well, &#383;he was a Midwife.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Cade.</speaker>
<line>My wife descended of the Lacies.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>But.</speaker>
<line>She was indeed a Pedlers daughter, &amp; &#383;old many</line>
<line>Laces.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Weauer.</speaker>
<line>But now of late, not able to trauell with her furr&#8217;d Packe, &#383;he washes buckes here at home.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Cade.</speaker>
<line>Therefore am I of an honorable house.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>But.</speaker>
<line>I by my faith, the field is honourable, and there was he borne, vnder a hedge: for his Father had neuer a house but the Cage.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Cade.</speaker>
<line>Valiant I am.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Weauer.</speaker>
<line>A must needs, for beggery is valiant.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Cade.</speaker>
<line>I am able to endure much.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>But.</speaker>
<line>No question of that: for I haue &#383;eene him whipt three Market dayes together.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Cade.</speaker>
<line>I feare neither &#383;word, nor fire.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Wea.</speaker>
<line>He neede not feare the &#383;word, for his Coate is of proofe.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>But.</speaker>
<line>But me thinks he &#383;hould &#383;tand in feare of fire, be-ing burnt i'th hand for &#383;tealing of Sheepe.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Cade.</speaker>
<line>Be braue then, for your Captaine is Braue, and Vowes Reformation. There &#383;hall be in England, &#383;euen halfe peny Loaues &#383;old for a peny: the three hoop&#8217;d pot, &#383;hall haue ten hoopes, and I wil make it Fellony to drink &#383;mall Beere.

<speaker>But.</speaker>
<line>The first thing we do, let's kill all the Lawyers.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Cade.</speaker>
<line>Nay, that I meane to do. Is not this a lamenta-ble thing, that of the &#383;kin of an innocent Lambe &#383;hould be made Parchment; that Parchment being &#383;cribeld ore, &#383;hould vnd&#339; a man. Some &#383;ay the Bee &#383;tings, but I &#383;ay, &#8216;tis the Bees waxe: for I did but &#383;eale once to a thing, and I was neuer mine owne man &#383;ince. How now? Who's there?</line>

<stagedir>Enter Sir Humfrey Stafford, and his Brother, with Drum and Soldiers</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>Staf.</speaker>
<line>Rebellious Hinds, the filth and &#383;cum of Kent,</line>
<line>Mark&#8217;d for the Gallowes: Lay your Weapons downe,</line>
<line>Home to your Cottages: forsake this Groome.</line>
<line>The King is mercifull, if you reuolt.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Bro.</speaker>
<line>But angry, wrathfull, and inclin&#8217;d to blood,</line>
<line>If you go forward: therefore yeeld, or dye.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Cade.</speaker>
<line>As for these &#383;ilken-coated &#383;laues I pa&#383;&#383;e not,</line>
<line>It is to you good people, that I &#383;peake,</line>
<line>Ouer whom (in time to come) I hope to raigne:</line>
<line>For I am rightfull heyre vnto the Crowne.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Staff.</speaker>
<line>Villaine, thy Father was a Playsterer,</line>
<line>And thou thy &#383;elfe a Sheareman, art thou not?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Cade.</speaker>
<line>And Adam was a Gardiner.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Bro.</speaker>
<line>And what of that?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Cade.</speaker>
<line>Marry, this Edmund Mortimer Earle of March, married the Duke of Clarence daughter, did he not?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Staf.</speaker>
<line>I &#383;ir.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Cade.</speaker>
<line>By her he had two children at one birth.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Bro.</speaker>
<line>That's false.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Cade.</speaker>
<line>I, there's the question; But I &#383;ay, &#8216;tis true:</line>
<line>The elder of them being put to nurse,</line>
<line>Was by a begger-woman &#383;tolne away,</line>
<line>And ignorant of his birth and parentage,</line>
<line>Became a Bricklayer, when he came to age.</line>
<line>His &#383;onne am I, deny it if you can.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>But.</speaker>
<line>Nay, &#8216;tis too true, therefore he &#383;hall be King.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Wea.</speaker>
<line>Sir, he made a Chimney in my Fathers house, &amp; the brickes are aliue at this day to testifie it: therefore deny it not.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Staf.</speaker>
<line>And will you credit this base Drudges Wordes, that &#383;peakes he knowes not what.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>All.</speaker>
<line>I marry will we: therefore get ye gone.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Bro.</speaker>
<line>Iacke Cade, the D[uke]. of York hath taught you this.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Cade.</speaker>
<line>He lyes, for I inuented it my &#383;elfe. Go too Sir-rah, tell the King from me, that for his Fathers &#383;ake Hen-ry the fift, (in whose time, boyes went to Span-counter for French Crownes) I am content he &#383;hall raigne, but Ile be Protector ouer him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Butcher.</speaker>
<line>And furthermore, wee'l haue the Lord Sayes head, for &#383;elling the Dukedome of Maine.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Cade</speaker>
<line>And good reason: for thereby is England main&#8217;d And faine to go with a &#383;taffe, but that my pui&#383;&#383;ance holds it vp. Fellow-Kings, I tell you, that that Lord Say hath gelded the Commonwealth, and made it an Eunuch: &amp; more then that, he can &#383;peake French, and therefore hee is a Traitor.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Staf.</speaker>
<line>O gro&#383;&#383;e and miserable ignorance.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Cade.</speaker>
<line>Nay an&#383;wer if you can: The Frenchmen are our enemies: go too then, I ask but this: Can he that &#383;peaks with the tongue of an enemy, be a good Councellour, or no?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>All.</speaker>
<line>No, no, and therefore wee'l haue his head.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Bro.</speaker>
<line>Well, &#383;eeing gentle words will not preuayle,</line>
<line>A&#383;&#383;aile them with the Army of the King.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Staf.</speaker>
<line>Herald away, and throughout euery Towne,</line>
<line>Proclaime them Traitors that are vp with Cade,</line>
<line>That those which flye before the battell ends,</line>
<line>May euen in their Wiues and Childrens &#383;ight,</line>
<line>Be hang&#8217;d vp for example at their doores:</line>
<line>And you that be the Kings Friends follow me.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>Cade.</speaker>
<line>And you that loue the Commons, follow me:</line>
<line>Now &#383;hew your &#383;elues men, &#8216;tis for Liberty.</line>
<line>We will not leaue one Lord, one Gentleman:</line>
<line>Spare none, but &#383;uch as go in clouted &#383;ho&#339;n,</line>
<line>For they are thrifty hone&#383;t men, and &#383;uch</line>
<line>As would (but that they dare not) take our parts.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>But.</speaker>
<line>They are all in order, and march toward vs.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Cade.</speaker>
<line>But then are we in order, when we are mo&#8217;t out of order. Come, march forward.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Alarums to the fight, wherein both the Staffords are &#383;laine. Enter Cade and the rest</stagedir>

<speaker>But.</speaker>
<line>Heere &#383;ir.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Cade.</speaker>
<line>They fell before thee like Sheepe and Oxen, &amp; thou behaued'st thy &#383;elfe, as if thou hadst beene in thine owne Slaughter-house: Therfore thus will I reward thee, the Lent &#383;hall bee as long againe as it is, and thou &#383;halt haue a License to kill for a hundred lacking one.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>But.</speaker>
<line>I desire no more.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Cade.</speaker>
<line>And to &#383;peake truth, thou deseru'st no le&#383;&#383;e. This Monument of the victory will I beare, and the bo-dies &#383;hall be dragg&#8217;d at my horse heeles, till I do come to London, where we will haue the Maiors &#383;word born be-fore vs.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>But.</speaker>
<line>If we meane to thriue, and do good, breake open the Gaoles, and let out the Prisoners.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Cade.</speaker>
<line>Feare not that I warrant thee. Come, let's march towards London.</line>

Be it knowne vnto thee by these presence, euen the presence of Lord Mortimer, that I am the Beesome that must &#383;weepe the Court cleane of &#383;uch filth as thou art: Thou hast mo&#8217;t traiterously corrupted the youth of the Realme, in erecting a Grammar Schoole: and where-as before, our Fore-fathers had no other Bookes but the Score and the Tally, thou hast caused printing to be vs&#8217;d, and contrary to the King, his Crowne, and Dignity, thou hast built a Paper-Mill. It will be prooued to thy Face, that thou hast men about thee, that vsually talke of a Nowne and a Verbe, and &#383;uch abhominable wordes, as no Christian eare can endure to heare. Thou hast appoin-ted Iustices of Peace, to call poore men before them, a-bout matters they were not able to an&#383;wer. Moreouer, thou hast put them in prison, and because they could not reade, thou hast hang&#8217;d them, when (indeede) onely for that cause they haue beene mo&#8217;t worthy to liue. Thou dost ride in a foot-cloth, dost thou not?</line>

I &#383;old not Maine, I lost not Normandie, Yet to recouer them would loose my life: Iustice with fauour haue I alwayes done, Prayres and Teares haue mou&#8217;d me, Gifts could neuer. When haue I ought exacted at your hands? Kent to maintaine, the King, the Realme and you, Large gifts haue I bestow&#8217;d on learned Clearkes, Because my Booke preferr&#8217;d me to the King. And &#383;eeing Ignorance is the curse of God, Knowledge the Wing wherewith we flye to heauen. Vnle&#383;&#383;e you be po&#383;&#383;est with diuellish &#383;pirits, You cannot but forbeare to murther me: This Tongue hath parlied vnto Forraigne Kings For your behoofe.</line>

<speaker>Cade.</speaker>
<line>I feele remorse in my &#383;elfe with his words: but Ile bridle it: he &#383;hall dye, and it bee but for pleading &#383;o well for his life.

Goe, take him away I &#383;ay, and &#383;trike off his head presently, and then breake into his Sonne in Lawes house, Sir Iames Cromer, and &#383;trike off his head, and bring them both vppon two poles hither.</line>

<line>It greeues my &#383;oule to leaue thee vna&#383;&#383;ail&#8217;d.</line>
</speech>
<stagedir>Exit War.</stagedir>
<speech>
<speaker>Clif.</speaker>
<line>What &#383;eest thou in me Yorke?</line>
<line>Why dost thou pause?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Yorke.</speaker>
<line>With thy braue bearing &#383;hould I be in loue,</line>
<line>But that thou art &#383;o fast mine enemie.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Clif.</speaker>
<line>Nor &#383;hould thy prowe&#383;&#383;e want praise &amp; esteeme,</line>
<line>But that &#8216;tis &#383;hewne ignobly, and in Treason.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Yorke.</speaker>
<line>So let it helpe me now against thy &#383;word,</line>
<line>As I in iustice, and true right expre&#383;&#383;e it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Clif.</speaker>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Yor.</speaker>
<line>A dreadfull lay, addre&#383;&#383;e thee instantly.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Clif.</speaker>
<line>La fin Corrone les eumenes.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Yor.</speaker>
<line>Thus Warre hath giuen thee peace, for y art &#383;till,</line>
<line>Peace with his &#383;oule, heauen if it be thy will.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter yong Clifford.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>Clif.</speaker>
<line>Shame and Confusion all is on the rout,</line>
<line>Feare frames disorder, and disorder wounds</line>
<line>Where it &#383;hould guard. O Warre, thou &#383;onne of hell,</line>
<line>Whom angry heauens do make their minister,</line>
<line>Throw in the frozen bosomes of our part,</line>
<line>Hot Coales of Vengeance. Let no Souldier flye.</line>
<line>He that is truly dedicate to Warre,</line>
<line>Hath no &#383;elfe-loue: nor he that loues himselfe,</line>
<line>Hath not e&#383;&#383;entially, but by circumstance</line>
<line>The name of Valour. O let the vile world end,</line>
<line>And the premised Flames of the Last day,</line>
<line>Knit earth and heauen together.</line>
<line>Now let the generall Trumpet blow his blast,</line>
<line>Particularities, and pettie &#383;ounds</line>
<line>To cease. Was't thou ordain&#8217;d (deere Father)</line>
<line>To loose thy youth in peace, and to atcheeue</line>
<line>The Siluer Liuery of aduised Age,</line>
<line>And in thy Reuerence, and thy Chaire-dayes, thus</line>
<line>To die in Ruffian battell? Euen at this &#383;ight,</line>
<line>My heart is turn&#8217;d to &#383;tone: and while &#8216;tis mine,</line>
<line>It &#383;hall be &#383;tony. Yorke, not our old men &#383;pares:</line>
<line>No more will I their Babes, Teares Virginall,</line>
<line>Shall be to me, euen as the Dew to Fire,</line>
<line>And Beautie, that the Tyrant oft reclaimes,</line>
<line>Shall to my flaming wrath, be Oyle and Flax:</line>
<line>Henceforth, I will not haue to do with pitty.</line>
<line>Meet I an infant of the house of Yorke,</line>
<line>Into as many gobbits will I cut it</line>
<line>As wilde Medea yong Absirtis did.</line>
<line>In cruelty, will I &#383;eeke out my Fame.</line>
<line>Come thou new ruine of olde Cliffords house:</line>
<line>As did Aeneas old Anchyses beare,</line>
<line>So beare I thee vpon my manly &#383;houlders:</line>
<line>But then, Aeneas bare a liuing loade;</line>
<line>Nothing &#383;o heauy as these w&#339;s of mine.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Richard, and Somerset to fight.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>Rich.</speaker>
<line>So lye thou there:</line>
<line>For vnderneath an Ale-house paltry &#383;igne,</line>
<line>The Castle in S[aint]. Albons, Somerset</line>
<line>Hath made the Wizard famous in his death:</line>
<line>Sword, hold thy temper; Heart, be wrathfull &#383;till:</line>
<line>Priests pray for enemies, but Princes kill.</line>
<line><stagedir>Fight. Excursions.</stagedir></line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter King, Queene, and others.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>Qu.</speaker>
<line>Away my Lord, you are &#383;low, for &#383;hame away.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>Can we outrun the Heauens? Good Margaret &#383;tay.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Qu.</speaker>
<line>What are you made of? You'l nor fight nor fly:</line>
<line>Now is it manhood, wisedome, and defence,</line>
<line>To giue the enemy way, and to &#383;ecure vs</line>
<line>By what we can, which can no more but flye.</line>
<line><stagedir>Alarum a farre off.</stagedir></line>
<line>If you be tane, we then &#383;hould &#383;ee the bottome</line>
<line>Of all our Fortunes: but if we haply &#383;cape,</line>
<line>(As well we may, if not through your neglect)</line>
<line>We &#383;hall to London get, where you are lou&#8217;d,</line>
<line>And where this breach now in our Fortunes made</line>
<line>May readily be &#383;topt.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Clifford.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>Clif.</speaker>
<line>But that my hearts on future mischeefe &#383;et, I would &#383;peake blasphemy ere bid you flye: But flye you must: Vncureable discomfite Reignes in the hearts of all our present parts. Away for your releefe, and we will liue To &#383;ee their day, and them our Fortune giue. Away my Lord, away. <stagedir>Exeunt</stagedir></line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Alarum. Retreat. Enter Yorke, Richard, Warwicke, and Soldiers, with Drum &amp; Colours</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>Yorke.</speaker>
<line>Of Salsbury, who can report of him,</line>
<line>That Winter Lyon, who in rage forgets</line>
<line>Aged contusions, and all brush of Time:</line>
<line>And like a Gallant, in the brow of youth,</line>
<line>Repaires him with Occasion. This happy day</line>
<line>Is not it &#383;elfe, nor haue we wonne one foot,</line>
<line>If Salsbury be lost.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Rich.</speaker>
<line>My Noble Father:</line>
<line>Three times to day I holpe him to his horse,</line>
<line>Three times bestrid him: Thrice I led him off,</line>
<line>Perswaded him from any further act:</line>
<line>But &#383;till where danger was, &#383;till there I met him,</line>
<line>And like rich hangings in a homely house,</line>
<line>So was his Will, in his old feeble body,</line>
<line>But Noble as he is, looke where he comes.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Salisbury.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>Sal.</speaker>
<line>Now by my Sword, well hast thou fought to day:</line>
<line>By'th&#8217; Ma&#383;&#383;e &#383;o did we all. I thanke you Richard.</line>
<line>God knowes how long it is I haue to liue:</line>
<line>And it hath pleas&#8217;d him that three times to day</line>
<line>You haue defended me from imminent death.</line>
<line>Well Lords, we haue not got that which we haue,</line>
<line>&#8216;Tis not enough our f&#339;s are this time fled,</line>
<line>Being opposites of &#383;uch repayring Nature.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Yorke.</speaker>
<line>I know our &#383;afety is to follow them,</line>
<line>For (as I heare) the King is fled to London,</line>
<line>To call a present Court of Parliament:</line>
<line>Let vs pursue him ere the Writs go forth.</line>
<line>What &#383;ayes Lord Warwicke, &#383;hall we after them?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>War.</speaker>
<line>After them: nay before them if we can:</line>
<line>Now by my hand (Lords) 'twas a glorious day.</line>
<line>Saint Albons battell wonne by famous Yorke,</line>
<line>Shall be eterniz&#8217;d in all Age to come.</line>
<line>Sound Drumme and Trumpets, and to London all,</line>
<line>And more &#383;uch dayes as these, to vs befall.</line>
