<LINE>Large &#383;ummes of Gold, and Dowries with their wiues,</LINE>

<LINE>Had Henrie got an Empire by his marriage,</LINE>
<LINE>And all the wealthy Kingdomes of the West,</LINE>
<LINE>There's reason he &#383;hould be displeas&#8217;d at it:</LINE>
<LINE>Looke to it Lords, let not his &#383;moothing words</LINE>
<LINE>Bewitch your hearts, be wise and circumspect.</LINE>
<LINE>What though the common people fauour him,</LINE>
<LINE>Calling him, Humfrey the good Duke of Gloster,</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<LINE>While these do labour for their owne preferment,</LINE>
<LINE>Behooues it vs to labor for the Realme.</LINE>
<LINE>I neuer &#383;aw but Humfrey Duke of Gloster,</LINE>
<LINE>Did beare him like a Noble Gentleman:</LINE>
<LINE>Oft haue I &#383;eene the haughty Cardinall,</LINE>
<LINE>More like a Souldier then a man o'th&#8217; Church,</LINE>
<LINE>As &#383;tout and proud as he were Lord of all,</LINE>
<LINE>Sweare like a Ruffian, and demeane himselfe</LINE>

<LINE>Warwicke my &#383;onne, the comfort of my age,</LINE>
<LINE>Thy deeds, thy plainne&#383;&#383;e, and thy house-keeping,</LINE>
<LINE>Hath wonne the greatest fauour of the Commons,</LINE>
<LINE>Excepting none but good Duke Humfrey.</LINE>

<LINE>In bringing them to ciuill Discipline:</LINE>
<LINE>Thy late exploits done in the heart of France,</LINE>
<LINE>When thou wert Regent for our Soueraigne,</LINE>
<LINE>Haue made thee fear&#8217;d and honor&#8217;d of the people,</LINE>
<LINE>Ioyne we together for the publike good,</LINE>
<LINE>In what we can, to bridle and &#383;uppre&#383;&#383;e</LINE>
<LINE>The pride of Suffolke, and the Cardinall,</LINE>
<LINE>With Somersets and Buckinghams Ambition,</LINE>

<LINE>Oh Father, Maine is lost,</LINE>
<LINE>That Maine, which by maine force Warwicke did winne,</LINE>
<LINE>And would haue kept, &#383;o long as breath did last:</LINE>
<LINE>Main-chance father you meant, but I meant Maine,</LINE>
<LINE>Which I will win from France, or else be &#383;laine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit Warwicke, and Salisbury. Manet Yorke.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEAKER>Yorke.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Aniou and Maine are giuen to the French,</LINE>
<LINE>Paris is lost, the &#383;tate of Normandie</LINE>
<LINE>Stands on a tickle point, now they are gone:</LINE>
<LINE>Suffolke concluded on the Articles,</LINE>
<LINE>The Peeres agreed, and Henry was well pleas&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>To change two Dukedomes for a Dukes faire daughter.</LINE>
<LINE>I cannot blame them all, what is't to them?</LINE>
<LINE>&#8216;Tis thine they giue away, and not their owne.</LINE>
<LINE>Pirates may make cheape penyworths of their pillage,</LINE>
<LINE>And purchase Friends, and giue to Curtezans,</LINE>
<LINE>Still reuelling like Lords till all be gone,</LINE>
<LINE>While as the &#383;illy Owner of the goods</LINE>

<LINE>And &#383;hakes his head, and trembling &#383;tands aloofe,</LINE>
<LINE>While all is &#383;har&#8217;d, and all is borne away,</LINE>
<LINE>Ready to &#383;terue, and dare not touch his owne.</LINE>
<LINE>So Yorke must &#383;it, and fret, and bite his tongue,</LINE>
<LINE>While his owne Lands are bargain&#8217;d for, and &#383;old:</LINE>
<LINE>Me thinkes the Realmes of England, France, &amp; Ireland,</LINE>
<LINE>Beare that proportion to my flesh and blood,</LINE>
<LINE>As did the fatall brand Althaea burnt,</LINE>
<LINE>Vnto the Princes heart of Calidon:</LINE>
<LINE>Aniou and Maine both giuen vnto the French?</LINE>
<LINE>Cold newes for me: for I had hope of France,</LINE>
<LINE>Euen as I haue of fertile Englands &#383;oile.</LINE>
<LINE>A day will come, when Yorke &#383;hall claime his owne,</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore I will take the Neuils parts,</LINE>
<LINE>And make a &#383;hew of loue to proud Duke Humfrey,</LINE>
<LINE>And when I &#383;py aduantage, claime the Crowne,</LINE>
<LINE>For that&#8217;s the Golden marke I &#383;eeke to hit:</LINE>
<LINE>Nor &#383;hall proud Lancaster vsurpe my right,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor hold the Scepter in his childish Fist,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor weare the Diadem vpon his head,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose Church-like humors fits not for a Crowne.</LINE>
<LINE>Then Yorke be &#383;till a-while, till time do &#383;erue:</LINE>
<LINE>Watch thou, and wake when others be asleepe,</LINE>
<LINE>To prie into the &#383;ecrets of the State,</LINE>
<LINE>Till Henrie &#383;urfetting in ioyes of loue,</LINE>
<LINE>With his new Bride, &amp; Englands deere bought Queen,</LINE>
<LINE>And Humfrey with the Peeres be falne at iarres:</LINE>
<LINE>Then will I raise aloft the Milke-white-Rose,</LINE>
<LINE>With whose &#383;weet &#383;mell the Ayre &#383;hall be perfum&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>And in my Standard beare the Armes of Yorke,</LINE>
<LINE>To grapple with the house of Lancaster,</LINE>
<LINE>And force perforce Ile make him yeeld the Crowne,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose bookish Rule, hath pull&#8217;d faire England downe.</LINE>

<LINE>His eldest Sister, Anne,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Queene.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Can you not &#383;ee? or will ye not obserue</LINE>
<LINE>The &#383;trangene&#383;&#383;e of his alter&#8217;d Countenance?</LINE>
<LINE>With what a Maiestie he beares himselfe,</LINE>
<LINE>How insolent of late he is become,</LINE>
<LINE>How prowd, how peremptorie, and vnlike himselfe.</LINE>
<LINE>We know the time &#383;ince he was milde and affable,</LINE>
<LINE>And if we did but glance a farre-off Looke,</LINE>
<LINE>Immediately he was vpon his Knee,</LINE>
<LINE>That all the Court admir&#8217;d him for &#383;ubmi&#383;&#383;ion.</LINE>
<LINE>But meet him now, and be it in the Morne,</LINE>
<LINE>When euery one will giue the time of day,</LINE>
<LINE>He knits his Brow, and &#383;hewes an angry Eye,</LINE>
<LINE>And pa&#383;&#383;eth by with &#383;tiffe vnbowed Knee,</LINE>
<LINE>Disdaining dutie that to vs belongs.</LINE>
<LINE>Small Curres are not regarded when they grynne,</LINE>
<LINE>But great men tremble when the Lyon rores,</LINE>
<LINE>And Humfrey is no little Man in England.</LINE>
<LINE>First note, that he is neere you in discent,</LINE>
<LINE>And &#383;hould you fall, he is the next will mount.</LINE>
<LINE>Me &#383;eemeth then, it is no Pollicie,</LINE>

<LINE>That he &#383;hould come about your Royall Person,</LINE>

<LINE>By flatterie hath he wonne the Commons hearts:</LINE>
<LINE>And when he please to make Commotion,</LINE>
<LINE>&#8216;Tis to be fear&#8217;d they all will follow him.</LINE>
<LINE>Now &#8216;tis the Spring, and Weeds are &#383;hallow-rooted,</LINE>
<LINE>Suffer them now, and they'le o&#8217;re-grow the Garden,</LINE>
<LINE>And choake the Herbes for want of Husbandry.</LINE>
<LINE>The reuerent care I beare vnto my Lord,</LINE>
<LINE>Made me collect these dangers in the Duke.</LINE>
<LINE>If it be fond, call it a Womans feare:</LINE>

<LINE>The Duche&#383;&#383;e, by his &#383;ubornation,</LINE>
<LINE>Vpon my Life began her diuellish practises:</LINE>

<LINE>Yet by reputing of his high discent,</LINE>
<LINE>As next the King, he was &#383;ucce&#383;&#383;iue Heire,</LINE>
<LINE>And &#383;uch high vaunts of his Nobilitie,</LINE>
<LINE>Did instigate the Bedlam braine-sick Duche&#383;&#383;e,</LINE>
<LINE>By wicked meanes to frame our Soueraignes fall.</LINE>
<LINE>Smooth runnes the Water, where the Brooke is deepe,</LINE>
<LINE>And in his &#383;imple &#383;hew he harbours Treason.</LINE>
<LINE>The Fox barkes not, when he would &#383;teale the Lambe.</LINE>
<LINE>No, no, my Soueraigne, Glouster is a man</LINE>

<LINE>As is the &#383;ucking Lambe, or harmele&#383;&#383;e Doue:</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Glost.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why &#8216;tis well known, that whiles I was Protector,</LINE>

<LINE>Be poysonous too, and kill thy forlorne Queene.</LINE>
<LINE>Is all thy comfort &#383;hut in Glosters Tombe?</LINE>
<LINE>Why then Dame Elianor was neere thy ioy.</LINE>
<LINE>Erect his Statue, and worship it,</LINE>

<LINE>Was I for this nye wrack&#8217;d vpon the Sea,</LINE>

<LINE>What did I then? But curst the gentle gusts,</LINE>

<LINE>And would not dash me with their ragged &#383;ides,</LINE>
<LINE>Because thy flinty heart more hard then they,</LINE>
<LINE>Might in thy Pallace, perish Elianor.</LINE>
<LINE>As farre as I could ken thy Chalky Cliffes,</LINE>
<LINE>When from thy Shore, the Tempest beate vs backe,</LINE>
<LINE>I &#383;tood vpon the Hatches in the &#383;torme:</LINE>

<LINE>For loosing ken of Albions wished Coast.</LINE>
<LINE>How often haue I tempted Suffolkes tongue</LINE>
<LINE>(The agent of thy foule inconstancie)</LINE>
<LINE>To &#383;it and watch me as Ascanius did,</LINE>
<LINE>When he to madding Dido would vnfold</LINE>

<LINE>Am I not witcht like her? Or thou not false like him?</LINE>
