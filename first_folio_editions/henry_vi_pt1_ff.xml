<line>Wherewith already France is ouer-run.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter another Me&#383;&#383;enger.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>Mes.</speaker>
<line>My gracious Lords, to adde to your laments,</line>
<line>Wherewith you now bedew King Henries hearse,</line>
<line>I must informe you of a dismall fight,</line>
<line>Betwixt the &#383;tout Lord Talbot, and the French.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Win.</speaker>
<line>What? wherein Talbot ouercame, is't &#383;o?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>3.Mes.</speaker>
<line>O no: wherein Lord Talbot was o&#8217;rethrown:</line>
<line>The circumstance Ile tell you more at large.</line>
<line>The tenth of August last, this dreadfull Lord,</line>
<line>Retyring from the Siege of Orleance,</line>
<line>Hauing full &#383;carce &#383;ix thousand in his troupe,</line>
<line>By three and twentie thousand of the French</line>
<line>Was round incompa&#383;&#383;ed, and &#383;et vpon:</line>
<line>No leysure had he to enranke his men.</line>
<line>He wanted Pikes to &#383;et before his Archers:</line>
<line>In &#383;tead whereof, &#383;harpe Stakes pluckt out of Hedges</line>
<line>They pitched in the ground confusedly,</line>
<line>To keepe the Horsemen off, from breaking in.</line>
<line>More then three houres the fight continued:</line>
<line>Where valiant Talbot, aboue humane thought,</line>
<line>Enacted wonders with his Sword and Lance.</line>
<line>Hundreds he &#383;ent to Hell, and none durst &#383;tand him:</line>
<line>Here, there, and euery where enrag&#8217;d, he &#383;lew.</line>
<line>The French exclaym&#8217;d, the Deuill was in Armes,</line>
<line>All the whole Army &#383;tood agaz&#8217;d on him.</line>
<line>His Souldiers &#383;pying his vndaunted Spirit,</line>
<line>A Talbot, a Talbot, cry&#8217;d out amaine,</line>
<line>And rusht into the Bowels of the Battaile.</line>
<line>Here had the Conquest fully been &#383;eal&#8217;d vp,</line>
<line>If Sir Iohn Falstaffe had not play&#8217;d the Coward.</line>
<line>He being in the Vauward, plac't behinde,</line>
<line>With purpose to relieue and follow them,</line>
<line>Cowardly fled, not hauing &#383;truck one &#383;troake.</line>
<line>Hence grew the generall wrack and ma&#383;&#383;acre:</line>
<line>Enclosed were they with their Enemies.</line>
<line>A base Wallon, to win the Dolphins grace,</line>
<line>Thrust Talbot with a Speare into the Back,</line>
<line>Whom all France, with their chiefe a&#383;&#383;embled &#383;trength,</line>
<line>Durst not presume to looke once in the face.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Bedf.</speaker>
<line>Is Talbot &#383;laine then? I will &#383;lay my &#383;elfe,</line>
<line>For liuing idly here, in pompe and ease,</line>
<line>Whil'st &#383;uch a worthy Leader, wanting ayd,</line>
<line>Vnto his dastard f&#339;-men is betray&#8217;d.</line>
</speech>

<speech>

<line>O no, he liues, but is tooke Prisoner,</line>
<line>And Lord Scales with him, and Lord Hungerford:</line>
<line>Mo&#8217;t of the rest &#383;laughter&#8217;d, or tooke likewise.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Bedf.</speaker>
<line>His Ransome there is none but I &#383;hall pay.</line>
<line>Ile hale the Dolphin headlong from his Throne,</line>
<line>His Crowne &#383;hall be the Ransome of my friend:</line>
<line>Foure of their Lords Ile change for one of ours.</line>
<line>Farwell my Masters, to my Taske will I,</line>
<line>Bonfires in France forthwith I am to make,</line>
<line>To keepe our great Saint Georges Feast withall.</line>
<line>Ten thousand Souldiers with me I will take,</line>
<line>Whose bloody deeds &#383;hall make all Europe quake.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>3.Me&#383;&#383;.</speaker>
<line>So you had need, for Orleance is besieg&#8217;d,</line>
<line>The English Army is growne weake and faint:</line>
<line>The Earle of Salisbury craueth &#383;upply,</line>
<line>And hardly keepes his men from mutinie,</line>
<line>Since they &#383;o few, watch &#383;uch a multitude.</line>

<line>Now we are Victors, vpon vs he &#383;miles.</line>
<line>What Townes of any moment, but we haue?</line>
<line>At pleasure here we lye, neere Orleance:</line>
<line>Otherwhiles, the famisht English, like pale Ghosts,</line>
<line>Faintly besiege vs one houre in a moneth.</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Reigneir.</speaker>
<line>Let's rayse the Siege: why liue we idly here?</line>
<line>Talbot is taken, whom we wont to feare:</line>
<line>Remayneth none but mad-brayn&#8217;d Salisbury,</line>
<line>And he may well in fretting &#383;pend his gall,</line>
<line>Nor men nor Money hath he to make Warre.</line>

</speech>

<speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Alanson.</speaker>
<line>Froysard, a Countreyman of ours, records,</line>

<line>For none but Samsons and Golia&#383;&#383;es</line>
<line>It &#383;endeth forth to &#383;kirmish: one to tenne?</line>

<line>They had &#383;uch courage and audacitie?</line>
</speech>

<speech>

<line>Let's leaue this Towne,</line>

<line>And hunger will enforce them to be more eager:</line>
<line>Of old I know them; rather with their Teeth</line>
<line>The Walls they'le teare downe, then forsake the Siege.</line>
</speech>

<line>It is of &#383;uch a &#383;pacious loftie pitch,</line>
<line>Your Roofe were not &#383;ufficient to contayn't.</line>

<speaker>Count.</speaker>
<line>Victorious Talbot, pardon my abuse,</line>

<line>Poore Gentleman, his wrong doth equall mine.</line>
<line>Since Henry Monmouth first began to reigne,</line>
<line>Before whose Glory I was great in Armes,</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Mort.</speaker>
<line>Direct mine Armes, I may embrace his Neck,</line>
<line>And in his Bosome &#383;pend my latter gaspe.</line>
<line>Oh tell me when my Lippes doe touch his Cheekes,</line>
<line>That I may kindly giue one fainting Ki&#383;&#383;e.</line>
<line>And now declare &#383;weet Stem from Yorkes great Stock,</line>
<line>Why didst thou &#383;ay of late thou wert despis&#8217;d?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Rich.</speaker>
<line>First, leane thine aged Back against mine Arme,</line>
<line>And in that ease, Ile tell thee my Disease.</line>
<line>This day in argument vpon a Case,</line>
<line>Some words there grew 'twixt Somerset and me:</line>
<line>Among which tearmes, he vs&#8217;d his lauish tongue,</line>
<line>And did vpbrayd me with my Fathers death;</line>
<line>Which obloquie &#383;et barres before my tongue,</line>
<line>Else with the like I had requited him.</line>
<line>Therefore good Vnckle, for my Fathers &#383;ake,</line>
<line>In honor of a true Plantagenet,</line>
<line>And for Alliance &#383;ake, declare the cause</line>
<line>My Father, Earle of Cambridge, lost his Head.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Mort.</speaker>
<line>That cause (faire Nephew) that imprison&#8217;d me,</line>
<line>And hath detayn&#8217;d me all my flowring Youth,</line>
<line>Within a loathsome Dungeon, there to pyne,</line>
<line>Was cursed Instrument of his decease.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Rich.</speaker>
<line>Discouer more at large what cause that was,</line>
<line>For I am ignorant, and cannot gue&#383;&#383;e.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Mort.</speaker>
<line>I will, if that my fading breath permit,</line>
<line>And Death approach not, ere my Tale be done.</line>
<line>Henry the Fourth, Grandfather to this King,</line>
<line>Depos&#8217;d his Nephew Richard, Edwards Sonne,</line>
<line>The first begotten, and the lawfull Heire</line>
<line>Of Edward King, the Third of that Descent.</line>
<line>During whose Reigne, the Percies of the North,</line>
<line>Finding his Vsurpation mo&#8217;t vniust,</line>
<line>Endeuour&#8217;d my aduancement to the Throne.</line>
<line>The reason mou&#8217;d these Warlike Lords to this,</line>
<line>Was, for that (young Richard thus remou&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Leauing no Heire begotten of his Body)</line>
<line>I was the next by Birth and Parentage:</line>
<line>For by my Mother, I deriued am</line>
<line>From Lionel Duke of Clarence, third Sonne</line>
<line>To King Edward the Third; whereas hee,</line>
<line>From Iohn of Gaunt doth bring his Pedigree,</line>
<line>Being but fourth of that Heroick Lyne.</line>
<line>But marke: as in this haughtie great attempt,</line>
<line>They laboured, to plant the rightfull Heire,</line>
<line>I lost my Libertie, and they their Liues.</line>
<line>Long after this, when Henry the Fift</line>
<line>(Succeeding his Father Bullingbrooke) did reigne;</line>
<line>Thy Father, Earle of Cambridge, then deriu&#8217;d</line>
<line>From famous Edmund Langley, Duke of Yorke,</line>
<line>Marrying my Sister, that thy Mother was;</line>
<line>Againe, in pitty of my hard distre&#383;&#383;e,</line>
<line>Leuied an Army, weening to redeeme,</line>
<line>And haue install&#8217;d me in the Diademe:</line>
<line>But as the rest, &#383;o fell that Noble Earle,</line>
<line>And was beheaded. Thus the Mortimers,</line>
<line>In whom the Title rested, were &#383;upprest.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Rich.</speaker>
<line>Of which, my Lord, your Honor is the last.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Mort.</speaker>
<line>True; and thou &#383;eest, that I no I&#383;&#383;ue haue,</line>
<line>And that my fainting words doe warrant death:</line>
<line>Thou art my Heire; the rest, I wish thee gather:</line>
<line>But yet be wary in thy &#383;tudious care.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Rich.</speaker>
<line>Thy graue admonishments preuayle with me:</line>
<line>But yet me thinkes, my Fathers execution</line>
<line>Was nothing le&#383;&#383;e then bloody Tyranny.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Mort.</speaker>
<line>With &#383;ilence, Nephew, be thou pollitick,</line>
<line>Strong fixed is the House of Lancaster,</line>
<line>And like a Mountaine, not to be remou&#8217;d.</line>
<line>But now thy Vnckle is remouing hence,</line>
<line>As Princes doe their Courts, when they are cloy&#8217;d</line>
<line>With long continuance in a &#383;etled place.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Rich.</speaker>
<line>O Vnckle, would &#383;ome part of my young yeeres</line>
<line>Might but redeeme the pa&#383;&#383;age of your Age.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Mort.</speaker>
<line>Thou do'st then wrong me, as y &#383;laughterer doth,</line>
<line>Which giueth many Wounds, when one will kill.</line>
<line>Mourne not, except thou &#383;orrow for my good,</line>
<line>Onely giue order for my Funerall.</line>
<line>And &#383;o farewell, and faire be all thy hopes,</line>
<line>And prosperous be thy Life in Peace and Warre.</line>
</speech>
<stagedir>Dyes.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>Rich.</speaker>
<line>And Peace, no Warre, befall thy parting Soule.</line>
<line>In Prison hast thou &#383;pent a Pilgrimage,</line>
<line>And like a Hermite ouer-past thy dayes.</line>
<line>Well, I will locke his Councell in my Brest,</line>
<line>And what I doe imagine, let that rest.</line>
<line>Keepers conuey him hence, and I my &#383;elfe</line>
<line>Will &#383;ee his Buryall better then his Life.</line>
<line><stagedir>Exit.</stagedir></line>
<line>Here dyes the duskie Torch of Mortimer,</line>
<line>Choakt with Ambition of the meaner &#383;ort.</line>
<line>And for those Wrongs, those bitter Iniuries,</line>
<line>Which Somerset hath offer&#8217;d to my House,</line>
<line>I doubt not, but with Honor to redre&#383;&#383;e.</line>
<line>And therefore haste I to the Parliament,</line>

<line>Who then, but English Henry, will be Lord,</line>
<line>And thou be thrust out, like a Fugitiue?</line>
<line>Call we to minde, and marke but this for proofe:</line>
<line>Was not the Duke of Orleance thy F&#339;?</line>
<line>And was he not in England Prisoner?</line>
<line>But when they heard he was thine Enemie,</line>
<line>They &#383;et him free, without his Ransome pay&#8217;d,</line>
<line>In &#383;pight of Burgonie and all his friends.</line>

<line>A Letter was deliuer&#8217;d to my hands,</line>
<line>Writ to your Grace, from th&#8217; Duke of Burgundy.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Tal.</speaker>
<line>Shame to the Duke of Burgundy, and thee:</line>
<line>I vow&#8217;d (base Knight) when I did meete the next,</line>
<line>To teare the Garter from thy Crauens legge,</line>
<line>Which I haue done, because (vnworthily)</line>
<line>Thou was't installed in that High Degree.</line>
<line>Pardon me Princely Henry, and the rest:</line>
<line>This Dastard, at the battell of Poictiers,</line>
<line>When (but in all) I was &#383;ixe thousand &#383;trong,</line>
<line>And that the French were almost ten to one,</line>
<line>Before we met, or that a &#383;troke was giuen,</line>
<line>Like to a trustie Squire, did run away.</line>
<line>In which a&#383;&#383;ault, we lost twelue hundred men.</line>
<line>My &#383;elfe, and diuers Gentlemen beside,</line>
<line>Were there &#383;urpriz&#8217;d, and taken prisoners.</line>
<line>Then iudge (great Lords) if I haue done ami&#383;&#383;e:</line>
<line>Or whether that &#383;uch Cowards ought to weare</line>
<line>This Ornament of Knighthood, yea or no?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Glo.</speaker>
<line>To &#383;ay the truth, this fact was infamous,</line>
<line>And ill beseeming any common man;</line>
<line>Much more a Knight, a Captaine, and a Leader.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Tal.</speaker>
<line>When first this Order was ordain&#8217;d my Lords,</line>
<line>Knights of the Garter were of Noble birth;</line>
<line>Valiant, and Vertuous, full of haughtie Courage,</line>
<line>Such as were growne to credit by the warres:</line>
<line>Not fearing Death, nor &#383;hrinking for Distre&#383;&#383;e,</line>
<line>But alwayes resolute, in mo&#8217;t extreames.</line>
<line>He then, that is not furnish&#8217;d in this &#383;ort,</line>
<line>Doth but vsurpe the Sacred name of Knight,</line>
<line>Prophaning this mo&#8217;t Honourable Order,</line>

<line>Sent from our Vnckle Duke of Burgundy.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Glo.</speaker>
<line>What meanes his Grace, that he hath chaung&#8217;d his Stile? No more but plaine and bluntly? (To the King.) Hath he forgot he is his Soueraigne? Or doth this churlish Superscription Pretend &#383;ome alteration in good will? What's heere? I haue vpon especiall cause, Mou&#8217;d with compa&#383;&#383;ion of my Countries wracke, Together with the pittifull complaints Of &#383;uch as your oppre&#383;&#383;ion feedes vpon, Forsaken your pernitious Faction, And ioyn&#8217;d with Charles, the rightfull king of France. O monstrous Treachery: Can this be &#383;o? That in alliance, amity, and oathes, There &#383;hould be found &#383;uch false di&#383;&#383;embling guile?</line>

<line>Come hither you that would be Combatants:</line>

<line>In France, amongst a fickle wauering Nation:</line>
<line>If they perceyue di&#383;&#383;ention in our lookes,</line>
<line>And that within our &#383;elues we disagree;</line>
<line>How will their grudging &#383;tomackes be prouok&#8217;d</line>

<line>Your wondrous rare description (noble Earle)</line>

<line>Do breed Loues &#383;etled pa&#383;&#383;ions in my heart,</line>
<line>And like as rigour of tempestuous gustes</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Suf.</speaker>
<line>Tu&#383;h my good Lord, this &#383;uperficiall tale,</line>
<line>Is but a preface of her worthy praise:</line>
<line>The cheefe perfections of that louely Dame,</line>
<line>(Had I &#383;ufficient &#383;kill to vtter them)</line>
<line>Would make a volume of inticing lines,</line>
<line>Able to rauish any dull conceit.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>And otherwise, will Henry ne're presume:</line>

<line>Then to be dealt in by Atturney-ship:</line>
<line>Not whom we will, but whom his Grace affects,</line>
<line>Must be companion of his Nuptiall bed.</line>
<line>And therefore Lords, &#383;ince he affects her mo&#8217;t,</line>
<line>Mo&#8217;t of all these reasons bindeth vs,</line>
<line>In our opinions &#383;he &#383;hould be preferr&#8217;d.</line>
<line>For what is wedlocke forced? but a Hell,</line>
<line>An Age of discord and continuall &#383;trife,</line>
<line>Whereas the contrarie bringeth bli&#383;&#383;e,</line>
<line>And is a patterne of Celestiall peace.</line>
<line>Whom &#383;hould we match with Henry being a King,</line>
<line>But Margaret, that is daughter to a King:</line>
<line>Her peerele&#383;&#383;e feature, ioyned with her birth,</line>
<line>Approues her fit for none, but for a King.</line>
<line>Her valiant courage, and vndaunted &#383;pirit,</line>
<line>(More then in women commonly is &#383;eene)</line>
<line>Will an&#383;wer our hope in i&#383;&#383;ue of a King.</line>
<line>For Henry, &#383;onne vnto a Conqueror,</line>
<line>Is likely to beget more Conquerors,</line>
<line>If with a Lady of &#383;o high resolue,</line>
<line>(As is faire Margaret) he be link&#8217;d in loue.</line>
<line>Then yeeld my Lords, and heere conclude with mee,</line>
<line>That Margaret &#383;hall be Queene, and none but &#383;hee.</line>

<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>Whether it be through force of your report,</line>
<line>My Noble Lord of Suffolke: Or for that</line>
<line>My tender youth was neuer yet attaint</line>
<line>With any pa&#383;&#383;ion of inflaming Loue,</line>
<line>I cannot tell: but this I am a&#383;&#383;ur&#8217;d,</line>
<line>I feele &#383;uch &#383;harpe di&#383;&#383;ention in my breast,</line>
<line>Such fierce alarums both of Hope and Feare,</line>
<line>As I am &#383;icke with working of my thoughts.</line>
<line>Take therefore &#383;hipping, poste my Lord to France,</line>
<line>Agree to any couenants, and procure</line>
<line>That Lady Margaret do vouchsafe to come</line>
<line>To cro&#383;&#383;e the Seas to England, and be crown&#8217;d</line>
<line>King Henries faithfull and annointed Queene.</line>
<line>For your expences and &#383;ufficient charge,</line>
<line>Among the people gather vp a tenth.</line>
<line>Be gone I &#383;ay, for till you do returne,</line>
<line>I rest perplexed with a thousand Cares.</line>
<line>And you (good Vnckle) banish all offence:</line>
<line>If you do censure me, by what you were,</line>
<line>Not what you are, I know it will excuse</line>
<line>This &#383;odaine execution of my will.</line>
<line>And &#383;o conduct me, where from company,</line>
<line>I may reuolue and ruminate my greefe.</line>

<line>Thus Suffolke hath preuail&#8217;d, and thus he goes</line>
<line>As did the youthfull Paris once to Greece,</line>
<line>With hope to finde the like euent in loue,</line>
<line>But prosper better than the Troian did:</line>
<line>Margaret &#383;hall now be Queene, and rule the King:</line>
<line>But I will rule both her, the King, and Realme.</line>
