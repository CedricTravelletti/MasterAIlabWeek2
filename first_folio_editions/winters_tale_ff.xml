<STAGEDIR>Enter Camillo and Archidamus.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Arch.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If you &#383;hall chance (Camillo) to visit Bohemia, on the like occasion whereon my &#383;eruices are now on-foot, you &#383;hall &#383;ee (as I haue &#383;aid) great dif-ference betwixt our Bohemia, and your Sicilia.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Cam.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I thinke, this comming Summer, the King of Sicilia meanes to pay Bohemia the Visitation, which hee iustly owes him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Arch.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Wherein our Entertainment &#383;hall &#383;hame vs: we will be iustified in our Loues: for indeed&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Cam.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Beseech you&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Arch.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Verely I &#383;peake it in the freedome of my know-ledge: we cannot with &#383;uch magnificence&#8212; in &#383;o rare&#8212; I know not what to &#383;ay&#8212; Wee will giue you &#383;leepie Drinkes, that your Sences (vn-intelligent of our insuffi-cience) may, though they cannot prayse vs, as little ac-cuse vs.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Cam.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You pay a great deale to deare, for what&#8217;s giuen freely.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Arch.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Beleeue me, I &#383;peake as my vnderstanding in-structs me, and as mine honestie puts it to vtterance.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Cam.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sicilia cannot &#383;hew himselfe ouer-kind to Bohe-mia: They were trayn&#8217;d together in their Child-hoods; and there rooted betwixt them then &#383;uch an affection, which cannot chuse but braunch now. Since their more mature Dignities, and Royall Nece&#383;&#383;ities, made &#383;eperati-on of their Societie, their Encounters (though not Perso-nall) hath been Royally attornyed with enter-change of Gifts, Letters, louing Emba&#383;&#383;ies, that they haue &#383;eem&#8217;d to be together, though absent: &#383;hooke hands, as ouer a Vast; and embrac&#8217;d as it were from the ends of opposed Winds. The Heauens continue their Loues.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Arch.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I thinke there is not in the World, either Malice or Matter, to alter it. You haue an vnspeakable comfort of your young Prince Mamillius: it is a Gentleman of the greatest Promise, that euer came into my Note.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Cam.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I very well agree with you, in the hopes of him: it is a gallant Child; one, that (indeed) Physicks the Sub-iect, makes old hearts fresh: they that went on Crutches ere he was borne, desire yet their life, to &#383;ee him a Man.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Arch.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Would they else be content to die?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Cam.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes; if there were no other excuse, why they &#383;hould desire to liue.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Arch.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If the King had no Sonne, they would desire to liue on Crutches till he had one.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>Pol.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We were as twyn&#8217;d Lambs, that did frisk i'th&#8217; Sun,</LINE>
<LINE>And bleat the one at th&#8217; other: what we chang&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Was Innocence, for Innocence: we knew not</LINE>
<LINE>The Doctrine of ill-doing, nor dream&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>That any did: Had we pursu&#8217;d that life,</LINE>

<LINE>As fat as tame things: One good deed, dying tonguele&#383;&#383;e,</LINE>
<LINE>Slaughters a thousand, wayting vpon that.</LINE>
<LINE>Our prayses are our Wages. You may ride's</LINE>
<LINE>With one &#383;oft Ki&#383;&#383;e a thousand Furlongs, ere</LINE>
<LINE>With Spur we heat an Acre. But to th&#8217; Goale:</LINE>
<LINE>My last good deed, was to entreat his &#383;tay.</LINE>
<LINE>What was my first? it ha's an elder Sister,</LINE>
<LINE>Or I mistake you: O, would her Name were Grace.</LINE>
<LINE>But once before I &#383;poke to th&#8217; purpose? when?</LINE>
<LINE>Nay, let me haue't: I long.</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Leo.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Too hot, too hot:</LINE>
<LINE>To mingle friendship farre, is mingling bloods.</LINE>
<LINE>I haue Tremor Cordis on me: my heart daunces,</LINE>
<LINE>But not for ioy; not ioy. This Entertainment</LINE>
<LINE>May a free face put on: deriue a Libertie</LINE>
<LINE>From Heartine&#383;&#383;e, from Bountie, fertile Bosome,</LINE>
<LINE>And well become the Agent: 't may; I graunt:</LINE>
<LINE>But to be padling Palmes, and pinching Fingers,</LINE>
<LINE>As now they are, and making practis&#8217;d Smiles</LINE>
<LINE>As in a Looking-Gla&#383;&#383;e; and then to &#383;igh, as 'twere</LINE>

<LINE>Why that&#8217;s my Bawcock: what? has't &#383;mutch&#8217;d thy Nose?</LINE>
<LINE>They &#383;ay it is a Coppy out of mine. Come Captaine,</LINE>
<LINE>We must be neat; not neat, but cleanly, Captaine:</LINE>
<LINE>And yet the Steere, the Heycfer, and the Calfe,</LINE>
<LINE>Are all call&#8217;d Neat. Still Virginalling</LINE>

<LINE>As Dice are to be wish&#8217;d, by one that fixes</LINE>
<LINE>No borne 'twixt his and mine; yet were it true,</LINE>
<LINE>To &#383;ay this Boy were like me. Come (Sir Page)</LINE>
<LINE>Looke on me with your Welkin eye: &#383;weet Villaine,</LINE>
<LINE>Mo&#8217;t dear'st, my Collop: Can thy Dam, may't be</LINE>
<LINE>Affection? thy Intention &#383;tabs the Center.</LINE>
<LINE>Thou do'st make po&#383;&#383;ible things not &#383;o held,</LINE>
<LINE>Communicat'st with Dreames (how can this be?)</LINE>
<LINE>With what&#8217;s vnreall: thou coactiue art,</LINE>
<LINE>And fellow'st nothing. Then &#8216;tis very credent,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou may'st co-ioyne with &#383;omething, and thou do'st,</LINE>
<LINE>(And that beyond Commi&#383;&#383;ion) and I find it,</LINE>

<LINE>It's tenderne&#383;&#383;e? and make it &#383;elfe a Pastime</LINE>

<LINE>Since what I am to &#383;ay, must be but that</LINE>

<LINE>A Lady like me; with a Loue, euen &#383;uch,</LINE>
<LINE>So, and no other, as your &#383;elfe commanded:</LINE>

<LINE>Euen &#383;ince it could &#383;peake, from an Infant, freely,</LINE>

<LINE>I know not how it tastes, though it be dish&#8217;d</LINE>

My Clowne (who wants but &#383;ome-thing to be a reasonable man) grew &#383;o in loue with the Wenches Song, that hee would not &#383;tirre his Petty-t&#339;s, till he had both Tune and Words, which &#383;o drew the rest of the Heard to me, that all their other Sences &#383;tucke in Eares: you might haue pinch&#8217;d a Placket, it was &#383;ence-le&#383;&#383;e; 'twas nothing to gueld a Cod-peece of a Purse: I would haue fill&#8217;d Keyes of that hung in Chaynes: no hearing, no feeling, but my Sirs Song, and admiring the Nothing of it. So that in this time of Lethargie, I pickd and cut mo&#8217;t of their Festiuall Purses: And had not the old-man come in with a Whoo-bub against his Daugh-ter, and the Kings Sonne, and &#383;car&#8217;d my Chowghes from the Chaffe, I had not left a Purse aliue in the whole Army.</LINE>

The Prince himselfe is about a peece of Iniquitie (stealing away from his Father, with his Clog at his heeles:) if I thought it were a peece of ho-nestie to acquaint the King withall, I would not do't: I hold it the more knauerie to conceale it; and therein am I constant to my Profe&#383;&#383;ion. <STAGEDIR>Enter Clowne and Shepheard.</STAGEDIR> Aside, aside, here is more matter for a hot braine: Euery Lanes end, euery Shop, Church, Se&#383;&#383;ion, Hanging, yeelds a carefull man worke.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>Gent.1.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I was by at the opening of the Farthell, heard the old Shepheard deliuer the manner how he found it: Whereupon (after a little amazedne&#383;&#383;e) we were all com-manded out of the Chamber: onely this (me thought) I heard the Shepheard &#383;ay, he found the Child.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>I would mo&#8217;t gladly know the i&#383;&#383;ue of it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Gent.1.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I make a broken deliuerie of the Busine&#383;&#383;e; but the changes I perceiued in the King, and Camillo, were very Notes of admiration: they &#383;eem&#8217;d almost, with &#383;ta-ring on one another, to teare the Cases of their Eyes. There was &#383;peech in their dumbne&#383;&#383;e, Language in their very gesture: they look&#8217;d as they had heard of a World ransom&#8217;d, or one destroyed: a notable pa&#383;&#383;ion of Won-der appeared in them: but the wisest beholder, that knew no more but &#383;eeing, could not &#383;ay, if th&#8217; importance were Ioy, or Sorrow; but in the extremitie of the one, it must needs be. <STAGEDIR>Enter another Gentleman.</STAGEDIR> Here comes a Gentleman, that happily knowes more: The Newes, Rogero.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Gent.2.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nothing but Bon-fires: the Oracle is fulfill&#8217;d: the Kings Daughter is found: &#383;uch a deale of wonder is broken out within this houre, that Ballad-makers cannot be able to expre&#383;&#383;e it. <STAGEDIR>Enter another Gentleman.</STAGEDIR> Here comes the Lady Paulina's Steward, hee can deliuer you more. How goes it now (Sir.) This Newes (which is call&#8217;d true) is &#383;o like an old Tale, that the veritie of it is in &#383;trong &#383;uspition: Ha's the King found his Heire?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Gent.3.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Mo&#8217;t true, if euer Truth were pregnant by Circumstance: That which you heare, you'le &#383;weare you &#383;ee, there is &#383;uch vnitie in the proofes. The Mantle of Queene Hermiones: her Iewell about the Neck of it: the Letters of Antigonus found with it, which they know to be his Character: the Maiestie of the Creature, in re-semblance of the Mother: the Affection of Noblene&#383;&#383;e, which Nature &#383;hewes aboue her Breeding, and many o-ther Euidences, proclayme her, with all certaintie, to be the Kings Daughter. Did you &#383;ee the meeting of the two Kings?</LINE>

There might you haue be-held one Ioy crowne another, &#383;o and in &#383;uch manner, that it &#383;eem&#8217;d Sorrow wept to take leaue of them: for their Ioy waded in teares. There was casting vp of Eyes, hol-ding vp of Hands, with Countenance of &#383;uch distraction, that they were to be knowne by Garment, not by Fauor. Our King being ready to leape out of himselfe, for ioy of his found Daughter; as if that Ioy were now become a Lo&#383;&#383;e, cryes, Oh, thy Mother, thy Mother: then askes Bohemia forgiuene&#383;&#383;e, then embraces his Sonne-in-Law: then againe worryes he his Daughter, with clipping her. Now he thanks the old Shepheard (which &#383;tands by, like a Weather-bitten Conduit, of many Kings Reignes.)
