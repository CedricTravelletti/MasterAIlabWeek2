<LINE>No more &#383;hall trenching Warre channell her fields,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor bruise her Flowrets with the Armed hoofes</LINE>
<LINE>Of hostile paces. Those opposed eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>Which like the Meteors of a troubled Heauen,</LINE>
<LINE>All of one Nature, of one Substance bred,</LINE>

<LINE>Against Acquaintance, Kindred, and Allies.</LINE>
<LINE>The edge of Warre, like an ill-sheathed knife,</LINE>

<LINE>Leading the men of Herefordshire to fight</LINE>
<LINE>Against the irregular and wilde Glendower,</LINE>
<LINE>Was by the rude hands of that Welshman taken,</LINE>
<LINE>And a thousand of his people butchered:</LINE>
<LINE>Vpon whose dead corpes there was &#383;uch misuse,</LINE>
<LINE>Such beastly, &#383;hamele&#383;&#383;e transformation,</LINE>
<LINE>By those Welshwomen done, as may not be</LINE>
<LINE>(Without much &#383;hame) re-told or &#383;poken of.</LINE>

<LINE>At Holmeden met, where they did &#383;pend</LINE>
<LINE>A &#383;ad and bloody houre:</LINE>
<LINE>As by discharge of their Artillerie,</LINE>
<LINE>And &#383;hape of likely-hood the newes was told:</LINE>

<LINE>Then would I haue his Harry, and he mine:</LINE>
<LINE>But let him from my thoughts. What thinke you Coze</LINE>

<LINE>I &#383;hall haue none but Mordake Earle of Fife.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEAKER>Prin.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know you all, and will a-while vphold</LINE>
<LINE>The vnyoak&#8217;d humor of your idlene&#383;&#383;e:</LINE>
<LINE>Yet heerein will I imitate the Sunne,</LINE>
<LINE>Who doth permit the base contagious cloudes</LINE>
<LINE>To &#383;mother vp his Beauty from the world,</LINE>
<LINE>That when he please againe to be himselfe,</LINE>
<LINE>Being wanted, he may be more wondred at,</LINE>
<LINE>By breaking through the foule and vgly mists</LINE>
<LINE>Of vapours, that did &#383;eeme to &#383;trangle him.</LINE>
<LINE>If all the yeare were playing holidaies,</LINE>
<LINE>To &#383;port, would be as tedious as to worke;</LINE>
<LINE>But when they &#383;eldome come, they wisht-for come,</LINE>
<LINE>And nothing pleaseth but rare accidents.</LINE>
<LINE>So when this loose behauiour I throw off,</LINE>
<LINE>And pay the debt I neuer promised;</LINE>
<LINE>By how much better then my word I am,</LINE>
<LINE>By &#383;o much &#383;hall I falsifie mens hopes,</LINE>
<LINE>And like bright Mettall on a &#383;ullen ground:</LINE>
<LINE>My reformation glittering o&#8217;re my fault,</LINE>
<LINE>Shall &#383;hew more goodly, and attract more eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>Then that which hath no foyle to &#383;et it off.</LINE>

<LINE>You haue good leaue to leaue vs. When we need</LINE>

<LINE>You were about to &#383;peake.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>North.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yea, my good Lord.</LINE>
<LINE>Those Prisoners in your Highne&#383;&#383;e demanded,</LINE>
<LINE>Which Harry Percy heere at Holmedon tooke,</LINE>
<LINE>Were (as he &#383;ayes) not with &#383;uch &#383;trength denied</LINE>
<LINE>As was deliuered to your Maiesty:</LINE>
<LINE>Who either through enuy, or misprision,</LINE>
<LINE>Was guilty of this fault; and not my Sonne.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Hot.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My Liege, I did deny no Prisoners.</LINE>
<LINE>But, I remember when the fight was done,</LINE>
<LINE>When I was dry with Rage, and extreame Toyle,</LINE>
<LINE>Breathle&#383;&#383;e, and Faint, leaning vpon my Sword,</LINE>
<LINE>Came there a certaine Lord, neat and trimly drest;</LINE>
<LINE>Fresh as a Bride-groome, and his Chin new reapt,</LINE>
<LINE>Shew&#8217;d like a &#383;tubble Land at Haruest home.</LINE>
<LINE>He was perfumed like a Milliner,</LINE>
<LINE>And 'twixt his Finger and his Thumbe, he held</LINE>
<LINE>A Pouncet-box: which euer and anon</LINE>
<LINE>He gaue his Nose, and took't away againe:</LINE>
<LINE>Who therewith angry, when it next came there,</LINE>
<LINE>Tooke it in Snuffe. And &#383;till he &#383;mil&#8217;d and talk&#8217;d:</LINE>
<LINE>And as the Souldiers bare dead bodies by,</LINE>
<LINE>He call&#8217;d them vntaught Knaues, Vnmannerly,</LINE>
<LINE>To bring a &#383;louenly vnhandsome Coarse</LINE>
<LINE>Betwixt the Winde, and his Nobility.</LINE>
<LINE>With many Holiday and Lady tearme</LINE>
<LINE>He question&#8217;d me: Among the rest, demanded</LINE>
<LINE>My Prisoners, in your Maiesties behalfe.</LINE>
<LINE>I then, all-smarting, with my wounds being cold,</LINE>
<LINE>(To be &#383;o pestered with a Popingay)</LINE>
<LINE>Out of my Greefe, and my Impatience,</LINE>
<LINE>Answer&#8217;d (neglectingly) I know not what,</LINE>
<LINE>He &#383;hould, or &#383;hould not: For he made me mad,</LINE>
<LINE>To &#383;ee him &#383;hine &#383;o briske, and &#383;mell &#383;o &#383;weet,</LINE>
<LINE>And talke &#383;o like a Waiting-Gentlewoman,</LINE>
<LINE>Of Guns, &amp; Drums, and Wounds: God &#383;aue the marke;</LINE>
<LINE>And telling me, the Soueraign'st thing on earth</LINE>
<LINE>Was Parmacity, for an inward bruise:</LINE>
<LINE>And that it was great pitty, &#383;o it was,</LINE>
<LINE>That villanous Salt-peter &#383;hould be digg&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>Out of the Bowels of the harmle&#383;&#383;e Earth,</LINE>
<LINE>Which many a good Tall Fellow had destroy&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>So Cowardly. And but for these vile Gunnes,</LINE>
<LINE>He would himselfe haue beene a Souldier.</LINE>
<LINE>This bald, vnioynted Chat of his (my Lord)</LINE>
<LINE>Made me to an&#383;wer indirectly (as I &#383;aid.)</LINE>
<LINE>And I beseech you, let not this report</LINE>
<LINE>Come currant for an Accusation,</LINE>
<LINE>Betwixt my Loue, and your high Maiesty.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Blunt.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The circumstance considered, good my Lord,</LINE>
<LINE>What euer Harry Percie then had &#383;aid,</LINE>
<LINE>To &#383;uch a person, and in &#383;uch a place,</LINE>
<LINE>At &#383;uch a time, with all the rest retold,</LINE>
<LINE>May reasonably dye, and neuer rise</LINE>
<LINE>To do him wrong, or any way impeach</LINE>
<LINE>What then he &#383;aid, &#383;o he vnsay it now.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>King.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why yet doth deny his Prisoners,</LINE>
<LINE>But with Prouiso and Exception,</LINE>
<LINE>That we at our owne charge, &#383;hall ransome &#383;traight</LINE>
<LINE>His Brother-in-Law, the foolish Mortimer,</LINE>
<LINE>Who (in my &#383;oule) hath wilfully betraid</LINE>
<LINE>The liues of those, that he did leade to Fight,</LINE>
<LINE>Against the great Magitian, damn&#8217;d Glendower:</LINE>
<LINE>Whose daughter (as we heare) the Earle of March</LINE>
<LINE>Hath lately married. Shall our Coffers then,</LINE>
<LINE>Be emptied, to redeeme a Traitor home?</LINE>
<LINE>Shall we buy Treason? and indent with Feares,</LINE>
<LINE>When they haue lost and forfeyted themselues.</LINE>
<LINE>No: on the barren Mountaine let him &#383;terue:</LINE>
<LINE>For I &#383;hall neuer hold that man my Friend,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose tongue &#383;hall aske me for one peny cost</LINE>
<LINE>To ransome home reuolted Mortimer.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Hot.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Reuolted Mortimer?</LINE>
<LINE>He neuer did fall off, my Soueraigne Liege,</LINE>
<LINE>But by the chance of Warre: to proue that true,</LINE>
<LINE>Needs no more but one tongue. For all those Wounds,</LINE>
<LINE>Those mouthed Wounds, which valiantly he tooke,</LINE>
<LINE>When on the gentle Seuernes &#383;iedgie banke,</LINE>
<LINE>In &#383;ingle Opposition hand to hand,</LINE>
<LINE>He did confound the best part of an houre</LINE>
<LINE>In changing hardiment with great Glendower:</LINE>
<LINE>Three times they breath&#8217;d, and three times did they drink</LINE>
<LINE>Vpon agreement, of &#383;wift Seuernes flood;</LINE>
<LINE>Who then affrighted with their bloody lookes,</LINE>
<LINE>Ran fearefully among the trembling Reeds,</LINE>
<LINE>And hid his crispe-head in the hollow banke,</LINE>
<LINE>Blood-stained with these Valiant Combatants.</LINE>
<LINE>Neuer did base and rotten Policy</LINE>
<LINE>Colour her working with &#383;uch deadly wounds;</LINE>
<LINE>Nor neuer could the Noble Mortimer</LINE>
<LINE>Receiue &#383;o many, and all willingly:</LINE>
<LINE>Then let him not be &#383;land'red with Reuolt.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>King.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou do'st bely him Percy, thou dost bely him;</LINE>
<LINE>He neuer did encounter with Glendower:</LINE>
<LINE>I tell thee, he durst as well haue met the diuell alone,</LINE>
<LINE>As Owen Glendower for an enemy.</LINE>
<LINE>Art thou not asham&#8217;d? But Sirrah, henceforth</LINE>
<LINE>Let me not heare you &#383;peake of Mortimer.</LINE>
<LINE>Send me your Prisoners with the &#383;peediest meanes,</LINE>

<LINE>And if the diuell come and roare for them</LINE>

<LINE>And tell him &#383;o: for I will ease my heart,</LINE>
<LINE>Although it be with hazard of my head.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>In his behalfe, Ile empty all these Veines,</LINE>
<LINE>And &#383;hed my deere blood drop by drop i'th dust,</LINE>
<LINE>But I will lift the downfall Mortimer</LINE>
<LINE>As high i'th Ayre, as this Vnthankfull King,</LINE>

<LINE>By Richard that dead is, the next of blood?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

They call drinking deepe, dy-ing Scarlet; and when you breath in your watering, then they cry hem, and bid you play it off. To conclude, I am &#383;o good a proficient in one quarter of an houre, that I can drinke with any Tinker in his owne Language during my life.

Thou art my Sonne: I haue partly thy Mothers Word, partly my Opinion; but chiefely, a villanous tricke of thine Eye, and a foolish hanging of thy nether Lippe, that doth warrant me. If then thou be Sonne to mee, heere lyeth the point: why, being Sonne to me, art thou &#383;o poynted at? Shall the ble&#383;&#383;ed Sonne of Heauen proue a Micher, and eate Black-berryes? a question not to bee askt. Shall the Sonne of England proue a Theefe, and take Purses? a question to be askt. There is a thing, Harry, which thou hast often heard of, and it is knowne to many in our Land, by the Name of Pitch: this Pitch (as ancient Writers doe report) doth defile; &#383;o doth the com-panie thou keepest: for Harry, now I doe not &#383;peake to thee in Drinke, but in Teares; not in Pleasure, but in Pas-sion; not in Words onely, but in W&#339;s also: and yet there is a vertuous man, whom I haue often noted in thy companie, but I know not his Name.</LINE>

If then the Tree may be knowne by the Fruit, as the Fruit by the Tree, then peremptorily I &#383;peake it, there is Vertue in that Falstaffe: him keepe with, the rest banish.

<LINE>Defect of Manners, want of Gouernment,</LINE>
<LINE>Pride, Haughtine&#383;&#383;e, Opinion, and Disdaine:</LINE>
<LINE>The least of which, haunting a Nobleman,</LINE>

O, thou art a perpetuall Triumph, an euer-lasting Bone-fire-Light: thou hast &#383;aued me a thousand Markes in Linkes and Torches, walking with thee in the Night betwixt Tauerne and Tauerne: But the Sack that thou hast drunke me, would haue bought me Lights as good cheape, as the dearest Chandlers in Europe.

<LINE>I rather of his absence make this vse:</LINE>
<LINE>It lends a Lustre, and more great Opinion,</LINE>
<LINE>A larger Dare to your great Enterprize,</LINE>
<LINE>Then if the Earle were here: for men must thinke,</LINE>
<LINE>If we without his helpe, can make a Head</LINE>

There's not a Shirt and a halfe in all my Company: and the halfe Shirt is two Napkins tackt to-gether, and throwne ouer the &#383;houlders like a Heralds Coat, without &#383;leeues: and the Shirt, to &#383;ay the truth, &#383;tolne from my Host of S[aint].

The better part of Valour, is Discretion; in the which better part, I haue &#383;aued my life. I am affraide of this Gun-powder Percy though he be dead.
