<line>My Lord, Ile tell you, that &#383;elfe Bill is vrg&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Which in th&#8217; eleue[n]th yere of y last Kings reign</line>
<line>Was like, and had indeed against vs past,</line>
<line>But that the &#383;cambling and vnquiet time</line>
<line>Did push it out of farther question.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Bish.Ely.</speaker>
<line>But how my Lord &#383;hall we resist it now?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Bish.Cant.</speaker>
<line>It must be thought on: if it pa&#383;&#383;e against vs,</line>
<line>We loose the better halfe of our Po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ion:</line>
<line>For all the Temporall Lands, which men deuout</line>
<line>By Testament haue giuen to the Church,</line>
<line>Would they &#383;trip from vs; being valu&#8217;d thus,</line>
<line>As much as would maintaine, to the Kings honor,</line>
<line>Full fifteene Earles, and fifteene hundred Knights,</line>
<line>Six thousand and two hundred good Esquires:</line>
<line>And to reliefe of Lazars, and weake age</line>
<line>Of indigent faint Soules, past corporall toyle,</line>
<line>A hundred Almes-houses, right well &#383;upply&#8217;d:</line>
<line>And to the Coffers of the King beside,</line>
<line>A thousand pounds by th&#8217; yeere. Thus runs the Bill.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Bish.Ely.</speaker>
<line>This would drinke deepe.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Bish.Cant.</speaker>
<line>'Twould drinke the Cup and all.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Bish.Ely.</speaker>
<line>But what preuention?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Bish.Cant.</speaker>
<line>The King is full of grace, and faire re-gard.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Bish.Ely.</speaker>
<line>And a true louer of the holy Church.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Bish.Cant.</speaker>
<line>The courses of his youth promis&#8217;d it not.</line>
<line>The breath no &#383;ooner left his Fathers body,</line>
<line>But that his wildne&#383;&#383;e, mortify&#8217;d in him,</line>
<line>Seem&#8217;d to dye too: yea, at that very moment,</line>
<line>Consideration like an Angell came,</line>
<line>And whipt th&#8217; offending Adam out of him;</line>
<line>Leauing his body as a Paradise,</line>
<line>T' inuelop and containe Celestiall Spirits.</line>
<line>Neuer was &#383;uch a &#383;odaine Scholler made:</line>
<line>Neuer came Reformation in a Flood,</line>
<line>With &#383;uch a heady currance &#383;cowring faults:</line>
<line>Nor neuer Hidra-headed Wilfulne&#383;&#383;e</line>
<line>So &#383;oone did loose his Seat; and all at once;</line>
<line>As in this King.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Bish.Ely.</speaker>
<line>We are ble&#383;&#383;ed in the Change.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Bish.Cant.</speaker>
<line>Heare him but reason in Diuinitie;</line>
<line>And all-admiring, with an inward wish</line>
<line>You would desire the King were made a Prelate:</line>
<line>Heare him debate of Common-wealth Affaires;</line>
<line>You would &#383;ay, it hath been all in all his &#383;tudy:</line>
<line>List his discourse of Warre; and you &#383;hall heare</line>
<line>A fearefull Battaile rendred you in Musique.</line>
<line>Turne him to any Cause of Pollicy,</line>
<line>The Gordian Knot of it he will vnloose,</line>
<line>Familiar as his Garter: that when he &#383;peakes,</line>
<line>The Ayre, a Charter&#8217;d Libertine, is &#383;till,</line>
<line>And the mute Wonder lurketh in mens eares,</line>
<line>To &#383;teale his &#383;weet and honyed Sentences:</line>
<line>So that the Art and Practique part of Life,</line>
<line>Must be the Mistre&#383;&#383;e to this Theorique.</line>
<line>Which is a wonder how his Grace &#383;hould gleane it,</line>
<line>Since his addiction was to Courses vaine,</line>
<line>His Companies vnletter&#8217;d, rude, and &#383;hallow,</line>
<line>His Houres fill&#8217;d vp with Ryots, Banquets, Sports;</line>
<line>And neuer noted in him any &#383;tudie,</line>
<line>Any retyrement, any &#383;equestration,</line>
<line>From open Haunts and Popularitie.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>B.Ely.</speaker>
<line>The Strawberry growes vnderneath the Nettle,</line>
<line>And holesome Berryes thriue and ripen best,</line>
<line>Neighbour&#8217;d by Fruit of baser qualitie:</line>
<line>And &#383;o the Prince obscur&#8217;d his Contemplation</line>
<line>Vnder the Veyle of Wildne&#383;&#383;e, which (no doubt)</line>
<line>Grew like the Summer Gra&#383;&#383;e, fastest by Night,</line>
<line>Vnseene, yet cre&#383;&#383;iue in his facultie.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>B.Cant.</speaker>
<line>It must be &#383;o; for Miracles are ceast:</line>
<line>And therefore we must needes admit the meanes,</line>
<line>How things are perfected.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>B.Ely.</speaker>
<line>But my good Lord:</line>
<line>How now for mittigation of this Bill,</line>
<line>Vrg&#8217;d by the Commons? doth his Maiestie</line>
<line>Incline to it, or no?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>B.Cant.</speaker>
<line>He &#383;eemes indifferent:</line>
<line>Or rather &#383;waying more vpon our part,</line>
<line>Then cherishing th&#8217; exhibiters against vs:</line>
<line>For I haue made an offer to his Maiestie,</line>
<line>Vpon our Spirituall Conuocation,</line>
<line>And in regard of Causes now in hand,</line>
<line>Which I haue open&#8217;d to his Grace at large,</line>
<line>As touching France, to giue a greater Summe,</line>
<line>Then euer at one time the Clergie yet</line>
<line>Did to his Predece&#383;&#383;ors part withall.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>B.Ely.</speaker>
<line>How did this offer &#383;eeme receiu&#8217;d, my Lord?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>B.Cant.</speaker>
<line>With good acceptance of his Maiestie:</line>
<line>Saue that there was not time enough to heare,</line>
<line>As I perceiu&#8217;d his Grace would faine haue done,</line>
<line>The &#383;eueralls and vnhidden pa&#383;&#383;ages</line>
<line>Of his true Titles to &#383;ome certaine Dukedomes,</line>
<line>And generally, to the Crowne and Seat of France,</line>
<line>Deriu&#8217;d from Edward, his great Grandfather.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>B.Ely.</speaker>
<line>What was th&#8217; impediment that broke this off?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>B.Cant.</speaker>
<line>The French Emba&#383;&#383;ador vpon that instant</line>
<line>Crau&#8217;d audience; and the howre I thinke is come,</line>
<line>To giue him hearing: Is it foure a Clock?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>B.Ely.</speaker>
<line>It is.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>B.Cant.</speaker>
<line>Then goe we in, to know his Emba&#383;&#383;ie:</line>
<line>Which I could with a ready gue&#383;&#383;e declare,</line>
<line>Before the Frenchman &#383;peake a word of it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>B.Ely.</speaker>
<line>Ile wait vpon you, and I long to heare it.</line>
<line><stagedir>Exeunt.</stagedir></line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter the King, Humfrey, Bedford, Clarence, Warwick, Westmerland, and Exeter</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>Where is my gracious Lord of Canterbury?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Exeter.</speaker>
<line>Not here in presence.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>Send for him, good Vnckle.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Westm.</speaker>
<line>Shall we call in th&#8217; Amba&#383;&#383;ador, my Liege?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>Not yet, my Cousin: we would be resolu&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Before we heare him, of &#383;ome things of weight,</line>
<line>That taske our thoughts, concerning vs and France.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter two Bishops.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>B.Cant.</speaker>
<line>God and his Angels guard your &#383;acred Throne,</line>
<line>And make you long become it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>Sure we thanke you.</line>
<line>My learned Lord, we pray you to proceed,</line>
<line>And iustly and religiously vnfold,</line>
<line>Why the Law Salike, that they haue in France,</line>
<line>Or &#383;hould or &#383;hould not barre vs in our Clayme:</line>
<line>And God forbid, my deare and faithfull Lord,</line>
<line>That you &#383;hould fashion, wrest, or bow your reading,</line>
<line>Or nicely charge your vnderstanding Soule,</line>
<line>With opening Titles miscreate, whose right</line>
<line>Sutes not in natiue colours with the truth:</line>
<line>For God doth know, how many now in health,</line>
<line>Shall drop their blood, in approbation</line>
<line>Of what your reuerence &#383;hall incite vs to.</line>
<line>Therefore take heed how you impawne our Person,</line>
<line>How you awake our &#383;leeping Sword of Warre;</line>
<line>We charge you in the Name of God take heed:</line>
<line>For neuer two &#383;uch Kingdomes did contend,</line>
<line>Without much fall of blood, whose guiltle&#383;&#383;e drops</line>
<line>Are euery one, a W&#339;, a &#383;ore Complaint,</line>
<line>'Gainst him, whose wrongs giues edge vnto the Swords,</line>
<line>That makes &#383;uch waste in briefe mortalitie.</line>
<line>Vnder this Coniuration, &#383;peake my Lord:</line>
<line>For we will heare, note, and beleeue in heart,</line>
<line>That what you &#383;peake, is in your Conscience washt,</line>
<line>As pure as &#383;inne with Baptisme.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>B.Can.</speaker>
<line>Then heare me gracious Soueraign, &amp; you Peers,</line>
<line>That owe your &#383;elues, your liues, and &#383;eruices,</line>
<line>To this Imperiall Throne. There is no barre</line>
<line>To make against your Highne&#383;&#383;e Clayme to France,</line>
<line>But this which they produce from Pharamond,</line>
<line>In terram Salicam Mulieres ne &#383;uccedant,</line>
<line>No Woman &#383;hall &#383;ucceed in Salike Land:</line>
<line>Which Salike Land, the French vniustly gloze</line>
<line>To be the Realme of France, and Pharamond</line>
<line>The founder of this Law, and Female Barre.</line>
<line>Yet their owne Authors faithfully affirme,</line>
<line>That the Land Salike is in Germanie,</line>
<line>Betweene the Flouds of Sala and of Elue:</line>
<line>Where Charles the Great hauing &#383;ubdu&#8217;d the Saxons,</line>
<line>There left behind and &#383;ettled certaine French:</line>
<line>Who holding in disdaine the German Women,</line>
<line>For &#383;ome dishonest manners of their life,</line>
<line>Establisht then this Law; to wit, No Female</line>
<line>Should be Inheritrix in Salike Land:</line>
<line>Which Salike (as I &#383;aid) 'twixt Elue and Sala,</line>
<line>Is at this day in Germanie, call&#8217;d Meisen.</line>
<line>Then doth it well appeare, the Salike Law</line>
<line>Was not deuised for the Realme of France:</line>
<line>Nor did the French po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;e the Salike Land,</line>
<line>Vntill foure hundred one and twentie yeeres</line>
<line>After defunction of King Pharamond,</line>
<line>Idly &#383;uppos&#8217;d the founder of this Law,</line>
<line>Who died within the yeere of our Redemption,</line>
<line>Foure hundred twentie &#383;ix: and Charles the Great</line>
<line>Subdu&#8217;d the Saxons, and did &#383;eat the French</line>
<line>Beyond the Riuer Sala, in the yeere</line>
<line>Eight hundred fiue. Besides, their Writers &#383;ay,</line>
<line>King Pepin, which deposed Childerike,</line>
<line>Did as Heire Generall, being descended</line>
<line>Of Blithild, which was Daughter to King Clothair,</line>
<line>Make Clayme and Title to the Crowne of France.</line>
<line>Hugh Capet also, who vsurpt the Crowne</line>
<line>Of Charles the Duke of Loraine, &#383;ole Heire male</line>
<line>Of the true Line and Stock of Charles the Great:</line>
<line>To find his Title with &#383;ome &#383;hewes of truth,</line>
<line>Though in pure truth it was corrupt and naught,</line>
<line>Conuey&#8217;d himselfe as th&#8217; Heire to th&#8217; Lady Lingare,</line>
<line>Daughter to Charlemaine, who was the Sonne</line>
<line>To Lewes the Emperour, and Lewes the Sonne</line>
<line>Of Charles the Great: also King Lewes the Tenth,</line>
<line>Who was &#383;ole Heire to the Vsurper Capet,</line>
<line>Could not keepe quiet in his conscience,</line>
<line>Wearing the Crowne of France, 'till &#383;atisfied,</line>
<line>That faire Queene Isabel, his Grandmother,</line>
<line>Was Lineall of the Lady Ermengare,</line>
<line>Daughter to Charles the foresaid Duke of Loraine:</line>
<line>By the which Marriage, the Lyne of Charles the Great</line>
<line>Was re-vnited to the Crowne of France.</line>
<line>So, that as cleare as is the Summers Sunne,</line>
<line>King Pepins Title, and Hugh Capets Clayme,</line>
<line>King Lewes his &#383;atisfaction, all appeare</line>
<line>To hold in Right and Title of the Female:</line>
<line>So doe the Kings of France vnto this day.</line>
<line>Howbeit, they would hold vp this Salique Law,</line>
<line>To barre your Highne&#383;&#383;e clayming from the Female,</line>
<line>And rather chuse to hide them in a Net,</line>
<line>Then amply to imbarre their crooked Titles,</line>
<line>Vsurpt from you and your Progenitors.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>May I with right and conscience make this claim?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Bish.Cant.</speaker>
<line>The &#383;inne vpon my head, dread Soueraigne:</line>
<line>For in the Booke of Numbers is it writ,</line>
<line>When the man dyes, let the Inheritance</line>
<line>Descend vnto the Daughter. Gracious Lord,</line>
<line>Stand for your owne, vnwind your bloody Flagge,</line>
<line>Looke back into your mightie Ancestors:</line>
<line>Goe my dread Lord, to your great Grandsires Tombe,</line>
<line>From whom you clayme; inuoke his Warlike Spirit,</line>
<line>And your Great Vnckles, Edward the Black Prince,</line>
<line>Who on the French ground play&#8217;d a Tragedie,</line>
<line>Making defeat on the full Power of France:</line>
<line>Whiles his mo&#8217;t mightie Father on a Hill</line>
<line>Stood &#383;miling, to behold his Lyons Whelpe</line>
<line>Forrage in blood of French Nobilitie.</line>
<line>O Noble English, that could entertaine</line>
<line>With halfe their Forces, the full pride of France,</line>
<line>And let another halfe &#383;tand laughing by,</line>
<line>All out of worke, and cold for action.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Bish.</speaker>
<line>Awake remembrance of these valiant dead,</line>
<line>And with your pui&#383;&#383;ant Arme renew their Feats;</line>
<line>You are their Heire, you &#383;it vpon their Throne:</line>
<line>The Blood and Courage that renowned them,</line>
<line>Runs in your Veines: and my thrice-pui&#383;&#383;ant Liege</line>
<line>Is in the very May-Morne of his Youth,</line>
<line>Ripe for Exploits and mightie Enterprises.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Exe.</speaker>
<line>Your Brother Kings and Monarchs of the Earth</line>
<line>Doe all expect, that you &#383;hould rowse your &#383;elfe,</line>
<line>As did the former Lyons of your Blood.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>West.</speaker>
<line>They know your Grace hath cause, and means, and might;</line>
<line>So hath your Highne&#383;&#383;e: neuer King of England</line>
<line>Had Nobles richer, and more loyall Subiects,</line>
<line>Whose hearts haue left their bodyes here in England,</line>
<line>And lye pauillion&#8217;d in the fields of France.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Bish.Can.</speaker>
<line>O let their bodyes follow my deare Liege</line>
<line>With Bloods, and Sword and Fire, to win your Right:</line>
<line>In ayde whereof, we of the Spiritualtie</line>
<line>Will rayse your Highne&#383;&#383;e &#383;uch a mightie Summe,</line>
<line>As neuer did the Clergie at one time</line>
<line>Bring in to any of your Ancestors.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>We must not onely arme t&#8217; inuade the French,</line>
<line>But lay downe our proportions, to defend</line>
<line>Against the Scot, who will make roade vpon vs,</line>
<line>With all aduantages.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Bish.Can.</speaker>
<line>They of those Marches, gracious Soueraign,</line>
<line>Shall be a Wall &#383;ufficient to defend</line>
<line>Our in-land from the pilfering Borderers.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>We do not meane the coursing &#383;natchers onely,</line>
<line>But feare the maine intendment of the Scot,</line>
<line>Who hath been &#383;till a giddy neighbour to vs:</line>
<line>For you &#383;hall reade, that my great Grandfather</line>
<line>Neuer went with his forces into France,</line>
<line>But that the Scot, on his vnfurnisht Kingdome,</line>
<line>Came pouring like the Tyde into a breach,</line>
<line>With ample and brim fulne&#383;&#383;e of his force,</line>
<line>Galling the gleaned Land with hot A&#383;&#383;ayes,</line>
<line>Girding with grieuous &#383;iege, Castles and Townes:</line>
<line>That England being emptie of defence,</line>
<line>Hath &#383;hooke and trembled at th&#8217; ill neighbourhood.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>B.Can.</speaker>
<line>She hath bin the[n] more fear&#8217;d the[n] harm&#8217;d, my Liege:</line>
<line>For heare her but exampl&#8217;d by her &#383;elfe,</line>
<line>When all her Cheualrie hath been in France,</line>
<line>And &#383;hee a mourning Widdow of her Nobles,</line>
<line>Shee hath her &#383;elfe not onely well defended,</line>
<line>But taken and impounded as a Stray,</line>
<line>The King of Scots: whom &#383;hee did &#383;end to France,</line>
<line>To fill King Edwards fame with prisoner Kings,</line>
<line>And make their Chronicle as rich with prayse,</line>
<line>As is the Owse and bottome of the Sea</line>
<line>With &#383;unken Wrack, and &#383;um-le&#383;&#383;e Treasuries.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Bish.Ely.</speaker>
<line>But there's a &#383;aying very old and true,</line>
<line>If that you will France win, then with Scotland first begin.</line>
<line>For once the Eagle (England) being in prey,</line>
<line>To her vnguarded Nest, the Weazell (Scot)</line>
<line>Comes &#383;neaking, and &#383;o &#383;ucks her Princely Egges,</line>
<line>Playing the Mouse in absence of the Cat,</line>
<line>To tame and hauocke more then &#383;he can eate.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Exet.</speaker>
<line>It followes then, the Cat must &#383;tay at home,</line>
<line>Yet that is but a crush&#8217;d nece&#383;&#383;ity,</line>
<line>Since we haue lockes to &#383;afegard nece&#383;&#383;aries,</line>
<line>And pretty traps to catch the petty theeues.</line>
<line>While that the Armed hand doth fight abroad,</line>
<line>Th&#8217; aduised head defends it &#383;elfe at home:</line>
<line>For Gouernment, though high, and low, and lower,</line>
<line>Put into parts, doth keepe in one consent,</line>
<line>Congreeing in a full and natural close,</line>
<line>Like Musicke.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Cant.</speaker>
<line>Therefore doth heauen diuide</line>
<line>The &#383;tate of man in diuers functions,</line>
<line>Setting endeuour in continual motion:</line>
<line>To which is fixed as an ayme or butt,</line>
<line>Obedience: for &#383;o worke the Hony Bees,</line>
<line>Creatures that by a rule in Nature teach</line>
<line>The Act of Order to a peopled Kingdome.</line>
<line>They haue a King, and Officers of &#383;orts,</line>
<line>Where &#383;ome like Magistrates correct at home:</line>
<line>Others, like Merchants venter Trade abroad:</line>
<line>Others, like Souldiers armed in their &#383;tings,</line>
<line>Make boote vpon the Summers Veluet buddes:</line>
<line>Which pillage, they with merry march bring home</line>
<line>To the Tent-royal of their Emperor:</line>
<line>Who busied in his Maiesties &#383;urueyes</line>
<line>The &#383;inging Masons building roofes of Gold,</line>
<line>The ciuil Citizens kneading vp the hony;</line>
<line>The poore Mechanicke Porters, crowding in</line>
<line>Their heauy burthens at his narrow gate:</line>
<line>The &#383;ad-ey&#8217;d Iustice with his &#383;urly humme,</line>
<line>Deliuering ore to Executors pale</line>
<line>The lazie yawning Drone: I this inferre,</line>
<line>That many things hauing full reference</line>
<line>To one consent, may worke contrariously,</line>
<line>As many Arrowes loosed &#383;euerall wayes</line>
<line>Come to one marke: as many wayes meet in one towne,</line>
<line>As many fresh &#383;treames meet in one &#383;alt &#383;ea;</line>
<line>As many Lynes close in the Dials center:</line>
<line>So may a thousand actions once a foote,</line>
<line>And in one purpose, and be all well borne</line>
<line>Without defeat. Therefore to France, my Liege,</line>
<line>Diuide your happy England into foure,</line>
<line>Whereof, take you one quarter into France,</line>
<line>And you withall &#383;hall make all Gallia &#383;hake.</line>
<line>If we with thrice &#383;uch powers left at home,</line>
<line>Cannot defend our owne doores from the dogge,</line>
<line>Let vs be worried, and our Nation lose</line>
<line>The name of hardine&#383;&#383;e and policie.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>Call in the Me&#383;&#383;engers &#383;ent from the Dolphin.</line>
<line>Now are we well resolu&#8217;d, and by Gods helpe</line>
<line>And yours, the noble &#383;inewes of our power,</line>
<line>France being ours, wee'l bend it to our Awe,</line>
<line>Or breake it all to peeces. Or there wee'l &#383;it,</line>
<line>(Ruling in large and ample Emperie,</line>
<line>Ore France, and all her (almost) Kingly Dukedomes)</line>

<line>Of your great Predece&#383;&#383;or, King Edward the third.</line>
<line>In an&#383;wer of which claime, the Prince our Master</line>
<line>Sayes, that you &#383;auour too much of your youth,</line>
<line>And bids you be aduis&#8217;d: There's nought in France,</line>
<line>That can be with a nimble Galliard wonne:</line>
<line>You cannot reuell into Dukedomes there.</line>
<line>He therefore &#383;ends you meeter for your &#383;pirit</line>
<line>This Tun of Treasure; and in lieu of this,</line>
<line>Desires you let the dukedomes that you claime</line>

<line>Shall &#383;trike his fathers Crowne into the hazard.</line>
<line>Tell him, he hath made a match with &#383;uch a Wrangler,</line>

<line>With Chaces. And we vnderstand him well,</line>
<line>How he comes o&#8217;re vs with our wilder dayes,</line>
<line>Not measuring what vse we made of them.</line>
<line>We neuer valew&#8217;d this poore &#383;eate of England,</line>
<line>And therefore liuing hence, did giue our &#383;elfe</line>
<line>To barbarous license: As &#8216;tis euer common,</line>
<line>That men are merriest, when they are from home.</line>
<line>But tell the Dolphin, I will keepe my State,</line>
<line>Be like a King, and &#383;hew my &#383;ayle of Greatne&#383;&#383;e,</line>
<line>When I do rowse me in my Throne of France.</line>

<line>That I will dazle all the eyes of France,</line>
<line>Yea &#383;trike the Dolphin blinde to looke on vs,</line>
<line>And tell the pleasant Prince, this Mocke of his</line>
<line>Hath turn&#8217;d his balles to Gun-stones, and his &#383;oule</line>
<line>Shall &#383;tand &#383;ore charged, for the wastefull vengeance</line>
<line>That &#383;hall flye with them: for many a thousand widows</line>
<line>Shall this his Mocke, mocke out of their deer husbands;</line>
<line>Mocke mothers from their &#383;onnes, mock Castles downe:</line>
<line>And &#383;ome are yet vngotten and vnborne,</line>

<line>But this lyes all within the wil of God,</line>
<line>To whom I do appeale, and in whose name</line>
<line>Tel you the Dolphin, I am comming on,</line>
<line>To venge me as I may, and to put forth</line>
<line>My rightfull hand in a wel-hallow&#8217;d cause.</line>
<line>So get you hence in peace: And tell the Dolphin,</line>
<line>His Iest will &#383;auour but of &#383;hallow wit,</line>

<line>The mercy that was quicke in vs but late,</line>
<line>By your owne counsaile is &#383;upprest and kill&#8217;d:</line>
<line>You must not dare (for &#383;hame) to talke of mercy,</line>
<line>For your owne reasons turne into your bosomes,</line>
<line>As dogs vpon their maisters, worrying you:</line>
<line>See you my Princes, and my Noble Peeres,</line>
<line>These English monsters: My Lord of Cambridge heere,</line>
<line>You know how apt our loue was, to accord</line>
<line>To furnish with all appertinents</line>
<line>Belonging to his Honour; and this man,</line>
<line>Hath for a few light Crownes, lightly conspir&#8217;d</line>

<line>To kill vs heere in Hampton. To the which,</line>
<line>This Knight no le&#383;&#383;e for bounty bound to Vs</line>

<line>What &#383;hall I &#383;ay to thee Lord Scroope, thou cruell,</line>
<line>Ingratefull, &#383;auage, and inhumane Creature?</line>
<line>Thou that didst beare the key of all my counsailes,</line>
<line>That knew'st the very bottome of my &#383;oule,</line>
<line>That (almost) might'st haue coyn&#8217;d me into Golde,</line>
<line>Would'st thou haue practis&#8217;d on me, for thy vse?</line>
<line>May it be po&#383;&#383;ible, that forraigne hyer</line>
<line>Could out of thee extract one &#383;parke of euill</line>
<line>That might annoy my finger? &#8216;Tis &#383;o &#383;trange,</line>
<line>That though the truth of it &#383;tands off as gro&#383;&#383;e</line>
<line>As black and white, my eye will &#383;carsely &#383;ee it.</line>
<line>Treason, and murther, euer kept together,</line>
<line>As two yoake diuels &#383;worne to eythers purpose,</line>
<line>Working &#383;o gro&#383;&#383;ely in an naturall cause,</line>
<line>That admiration did not hoope at them.</line>
<line>But thou (gainst all proportion) didst bring in</line>
<line>Wonder to waite on treason, and on murther:</line>
<line>And whats&#339;uer cunning fiend it was</line>
<line>That wrought vpon thee &#383;o preposterously,</line>
<line>Hath got the voyce in hell for excellence:</line>
<line>And other diuels that &#383;uggest by treasons,</line>
<line>Do botch and bungle vp damnation,</line>
<line>With patches, colours, and with formes being fetcht</line>
<line>From glist'ring &#383;emblances of piety:</line>
<line>But he that temper&#8217;d thee, bad thee &#383;tand vp,</line>
<line>Gaue thee no instance why thou &#383;houldst do treason,</line>
<line>Vnle&#383;&#383;e to dub thee with the name of Traitor.</line>
<line>If that &#383;ame Daemon that hath gull&#8217;d thee thus,</line>
<line>Should with his Lyon-gate walke the whole world,</line>
<line>He might returne to vastie Tartar backe,</line>
<line>And tell the Legions, I can neuer win</line>
<line>A &#383;oule &#383;o easie as that Englishmans.</line>
<line>Oh, how hast thou with iealousie infected</line>
<line>The &#383;weetne&#383;&#383;e of affiance? Shew men dutifull,</line>
<line>Why &#383;o didst thou: &#383;eeme they graue and learned?</line>
<line>Why &#383;o didst thou. Come they of Noble Family?</line>
<line>Why &#383;o didst thou. Seeme they religious?</line>
<line>Why &#383;o didst thou. Or are they &#383;pare in diet,</line>
<line>Free from gro&#383;&#383;e pa&#383;&#383;ion, or of mirth, or anger,</line>
<line>Constant in &#383;pirit, not &#383;weruing with the blood,</line>
<line>Garnish&#8217;d and deck&#8217;d in modest complement,</line>
<line>Not working with the eye, without the eare,</line>
<line>And but in purged iudgement trusting neither,</line>
<line>Such and &#383;o finely boulted didst thou &#383;eeme:</line>
<line>And thus thy fall hath left a kinde of blot,</line>
<line>To make thee full fraught man, and best indued</line>
<line>With &#383;ome &#383;uspition, I will weepe for thee.</line>
<line>For this reuolt of thine, me thinkes is like</line>

<line>Thus comes the English with full power vpon vs,</line>
<line>And more then carefully it vs concernes,</line>
<line>To an&#383;wer Royally in our defences.</line>
<line>Therefore the Dukes of Berry and of Britaine,</line>
<line>Of Brabant and of Orleance, &#383;hall make forth,</line>
<line>And you Prince Dolphin, with all &#383;wift dispatch</line>
<line>To lyne and new repayre our Townes of Warre</line>
<line>With men of courage, and with meanes defendant:</line>
<line>For England his approaches makes as fierce,</line>
<line>As Waters to the &#383;ucking of a Gulfe.</line>
<line>It fits vs then to be as prouident,</line>
<line>As feare may teach vs, out of late examples</line>
<line>Left by the fatall and neglected English,</line>
<line>Vpon our fields.</line>

<speech>

<line>My mo&#8217;t redoubted Father,</line>
<line>It is mo&#8217;t meet we arme vs 'gainst the F&#339;:</line>
<line>For Peace it &#383;elfe &#383;hould not &#383;o dull a Kingdome,</line>
<line>(Though War nor no knowne Quarrel were in question)</line>
<line>But that Defences, Musters, Preparations,</line>
<line>Should be maintain&#8217;d, a&#383;&#383;embled, and collected,</line>
<line>As were a Warre in expectation.</line>
<line>Therefore I &#383;ay, &#8216;tis meet we all goe forth,</line>
<line>To view the &#383;ick and feeble parts of France:</line>
<line>And let vs doe it with no &#383;hew of feare,</line>
<line>No, with no more, then if we heard that England</line>
<line>Were busied with a Whitson Morris-dance:</line>
<line>For, my good Liege, &#383;hee is &#383;o idly King&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Her Scepter &#383;o phantastically borne,</line>

<line>O peace, Prince Dolphin,</line>
<line>You are too much mistaken in this King:</line>

<line>With what great State he heard their Emba&#383;&#383;ie,</line>
<line>How well &#383;upply&#8217;d with Noble Councellors,</line>
<line>How modest in exception; and withall,</line>
<line>How terrible in constant resolution:</line>
<line>And you &#383;hall find, his Vanities fore-spent,</line>
<line>Were but the out-side of the Roman Brutus,</line>
<line>Couering Discretion with a Coat of Folly;</line>
<line>As Gardeners doe with Ordure hide those Roots</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Dolphin.</speaker>
<line>Well, &#8216;tis not &#383;o, my Lord High Constable.</line>
<line>But though we thinke it &#383;o, it is no matter:</line>
<line>In cases of defence, &#8216;tis best to weigh</line>
<line>The Enemie more mightie then he &#383;eemes,</line>
<line>So the proportions of defence are fill&#8217;d:</line>
<line>Which of a weake and niggardly proiection,</line>
<line>Doth like a Miser &#383;poyle his Coat, with &#383;canting</line>
<line>A little Cloth.</line>

<line>Mangle the Worke of Nature, and deface</line>
<line>The Patternes, that by God and by French Fathers</line>

<line>As modest &#383;tillne&#383;&#383;e, and humilitie:</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Boy.</speaker>
<line>As young as I am, I haue obseru&#8217;d these three Swashers: I am Boy to them all three, but all they three, though they would &#383;erue me, could not be Man to me; for indeed three &#383;uch Antiques doe not amount to a man: for Bardolph, hee is white-liuer&#8217;d, and red-fac&#8217;d; by the meanes whereof, a faces it out, but fights not: for Pistoll, hee hath a killing Tongue, and a quiet Sword; by the meanes whereof, a breakes Words, and keepes whole Weapons: for Nim, hee hath heard, that men of few Words are the best men, and therefore hee &#383;cornes to &#383;ay his Prayers, lest a &#383;hould be thought a Coward: but his few bad Words are matcht with as few good Deeds; for a neuer broke any mans Head but his owne, and that was against a Post, when he was drunke. They will &#383;teale any thing, and call it Purchase. Bardolph &#383;tole a Lute-case, bore it twelue Leagues, and &#383;old it for three halfepence. Nim and Bardolph are &#383;worne Brothers in filching: and in Callice they &#383;tole a fire-shouell. I knew by that peece of Seruice, the men would carry Coales. They would haue me as familiar with mens Pockets, as their Gloues or their Hand-kerchers: which makes much against my Manhood, if I &#383;hould take from anothers Pocket, to put into mine; for it is plaine pocketting vp of Wrongs. I must leaue them, and &#383;eeke &#383;ome better Seruice: their Villany goes against my weake &#383;tomacke, and therefore I must cast it vp. <stagedir>Exit.</stagedir></line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Flu.</speaker>
<line>To the Mynes? Tell you the Duke, it is not &#383;o good to come to the Mynes: for looke you, the Mynes is not according to the disciplines of the Warre; the con-cauities of it is not &#383;ufficient: for looke you, th&#8217; athuer-sarie, you may discu&#383;&#383;e vnto the Duke, looke you, is digt himselfe foure yard vnder the Countermines: by Cheshu, I thinke a will plowe vp all, if there is not better directi-ons. _</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Welch.</speaker>
<line>By Cheshu he is an A&#383;&#383;e, as in the World, I will verifie as much in his Beard: he ha's no more directions in the true disciplines of the Warres, looke you, of the Roman disciplines, then is a Puppy-dog.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Gower.</speaker>
<line>Is the Duke of Exeter &#383;afe?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Flu.</speaker>
<line>The Duke of Exeter is as magnanimous as Aga-memnon, and a man that I loue and honour with my &#383;oule, and my heart, and my dutie, and my liue, and my liuing, and my vttermost power. He is not, God be praysed and ble&#383;&#383;ed, any hurt in the World, but keepes the Bridge mo&#8217;t valiantly, with excellent discipline. There is an aun-chient Lieutenant there at the Pridge, I thinke in my very conscience hee is as valiant a man as Marke Anthony, and hee is a man of no estimation in the World, but I did &#383;ee him doe as gallant &#383;eruice.</line>

<line>Duke of Exeter doth loue thee well.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Flu.</speaker>
<line>I, I prayse God, and I haue merited &#383;ome loue at his hands.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Pist.</speaker>
<line>Bardolph, a Souldier firme and &#383;ound of heart, and of buxome valour, hath by cruell Fate, and giddie Fortunes furious fickle Wheele, that Godde&#383;&#383;e blind, that &#383;tands vpon the rolling restle&#383;&#383;e Stone.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Flu.</speaker>
<line>By your patience, aunchient Pistoll: Fortune is painted blinde, with a Muffler afore his eyes, to &#383;ignifie to you, that Fortune is blinde; and &#383;hee is painted also with a Wheele, to &#383;ignifie to you, which is the Morall of it, that &#383;hee is turning and inconstant, and mutabilitie, and variation: and her foot, looke you, is fixed vpon a Sphericall Stone, which rowles, and rowles, and rowles: in good truth, the P&#339;t makes a mo&#8217;t excellent descripti-on of it: Fortune is an excellent Morall.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Pist.</speaker>
<line>Fortune is Bardolphs f&#339;, and frownes on him: for he hath &#383;tolne a Pax, and hanged must a be: a damned death: let Gallowes gape for Dogge, let Man goe free, and let not Hempe his Wind-pipe &#383;uffocate: but Exeter hath giuen the doome of death, for Pax of little price. Therefore goe &#383;peake, the Duke will heare thy voyce; and let not Bardolphs vitall thred bee cut with edge of Penny-Cord, and vile reproach. Speake Captaine for his Life, and I will thee requite.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Flu.</speaker>
<line>Aunchient Pistoll, I doe partly vnderstand your meaning.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Pist.</speaker>
<line>Why then reioyce therefore.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Flu.</speaker>
<line>Certainly Aunchient, it is not a thing to reioyce at: for if, looke you, he were my Brother, I would desire the Duke to vse his good pleasure, and put him to execu-tion; for discipline ought to be vsed.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Pist.</speaker>
<line>Dye, and be dam&#8217;d, and Figo for thy friendship.</line>

<line>Ile a&#383;&#383;ure you, a vtt'red as praue words at the Pridge, as you &#383;hall &#383;ee in a Summers day: but it is very well: what he ha's &#383;poke to me, that is well I warrant you, when time is &#383;erue.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Gower.</speaker>
<line>Why &#8216;tis a Gull, a Foole, a Rogue, that now and then goes to the Warres, to grace himselfe at his returne into London, vnder the forme of a Souldier: and &#383;uch fellowes are perfit in the Great Commanders Names, and they will learne you by rote where Seruices were done; at &#383;uch and &#383;uch a Sconce, at &#383;uch a Breach, at &#383;uch a Con-uoy: who came off brauely, who was &#383;hot, who dis-grac&#8217;d, what termes the Enemy &#383;tood on: and this they conne perfitly in the phrase of Warre; which they tricke vp with new-tuned Oathes: and what a Beard of the Ge-neralls Cut, and a horride Sute of the Campe, will doe a-mong foming Bottles, and Ale-washt Wits, is wonder-full to be thought on: but you must learne to know &#383;uch &#383;landers of the age, or else you may be maruellously mi-stooke. _</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Flu.</speaker>
<line>I tell you what, Captaine Gower: I doe perceiue hee is not the man that hee would gladly make &#383;hew to the World hee is: if I finde a hole in his Coat, I will tell him my minde: hearke you, the King is comming, and I must &#383;peake with him from the Pridge.</line>

<line>I, &#383;o please your Maiestie: The Duke of Exeter ha's very gallantly maintain&#8217;d the Pridge; the French is gone off, looke you, and there is gallant and mo&#8217;t praue pa&#383;&#383;ages: marry, th&#8217; athuersarie was haue po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ion of the Pridge, but he is enforced to retyre, and the Duke of Exeter is Master of the Pridge: I can tell your Maiestie, the Duke is a praue man.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>What men haue you lost, Fluellen?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Flu.</speaker>
<line>The perdition of th&#8217; athuersarie hath beene very great, reasonnable great: marry for my part, I thinke the Duke hath lost neuer a man, but one that is like to be exe-cuted for robbing a Church, one Bardolph, if your Maie-stie know the man: his face is all bubukles and whelkes, and knobs, and flames a fire, and his lippes blowes at his nose, and it is like a coale of fire, &#383;ometimes plew, and &#383;ometimes red, but his nose is executed, and his fire's out.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>Wee would haue all &#383;uch offendors &#383;o cut off: and we giue expre&#383;&#383;e charge, that in our Marches through the Countrey, there be nothing compell&#8217;d from the Vil-lages; nothing taken, but pay&#8217;d for: none of the French vpbrayded or abused in disdainefull Language; for when Leuitie and Crueltie play for a Kingdome, the gentler Gamester is the &#383;oonest winner.</line>

Tell him, wee could haue rebuk&#8217;d him at Harflewe, but that wee thought not good to bruise an iniurie, till it were full ripe. Now wee &#383;peake vpon our Q. and our voyce is im-periall: England &#383;hall repent his folly, &#383;ee his weake-ne&#383;&#383;e, and admire our &#383;ufferance. Bid him therefore con-sider of his ransome, which must proportion the lo&#383;&#383;es we haue borne, the &#383;ubiects we haue lost, the disgrace we haue digested; which in weight to re-an&#383;wer, his petti-ne&#383;&#383;e would bow vnder. For our lo&#383;&#383;es, his Exchequer is too poore; for th&#8217; effusion of our bloud, the Muster of his Kingdome too faint a number; and for our disgrace, his owne person kneeling at our feet, but a weake and worth-le&#383;&#383;e &#383;atisfaction. To this adde defiance: and tell him for conclusion, he hath betrayed his followers, whose con-demnation is pronounc't: So farre my King and Master; &#383;o much my Office.</line>

<speaker>Bates.</speaker>
<line>He hath not told his thought to the King?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>No: nor it is not meet he &#383;hould: for though I &#383;peake it to you, I thinke the King is but a man, as I am: the Violet &#383;mells to him, as it doth to me; the Element &#383;hewes to him, as it doth to me; all his Sences haue but humane Conditions: his Ceremonies layd by, in his Na-kedne&#383;&#383;e he appeares but a man; and though his affecti-ons are higher mounted then ours, yet when they &#383;toupe, they &#383;toupe with the like wing: therefore, when he &#383;ees reason of feares, as we doe; his feares, out of doubt, be of the &#383;ame rellish as ours are: yet in reason, no man &#383;hould po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;e him with any appearance of feare; least hee, by &#383;hewing it, &#383;hould dis-hearten his Army.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Bates.</speaker>
<line>He may &#383;hew what outward courage he will: but I beleeue, as cold a Night as &#8216;tis, hee could wish him-&#383;elfe in Thames vp to the Neck; and &#383;o I would he were, and I by him, at all aduentures, &#383;o we were quit here.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>By my troth, I will &#383;peake my conscience of the King: I thinke hee would not wish himselfe any where, but where hee is.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Bates.</speaker>
<line>Then I would he were here alone; &#383;o &#383;hould he be &#383;ure to be ransomed, and a many poore mens liues &#383;aued.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>I dare &#383;ay, you loue him not &#383;o ill, to wish him here alone: hows&#339;uer you &#383;peake this to feele other mens minds, me thinks I could not dye any where &#383;o con-tented, as in the Kings company; his Cause being iust, and his Quarrell honorable.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Williams.</speaker>
<line>That's more then we know.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Bates.</speaker>
<line>I, or more then wee &#383;hould &#383;eeke after; for wee know enough, if wee know wee are the Kings Subiects: if his Cause be wrong, our obedience to the King wipes the Cryme of it out of vs.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Williams.</speaker>
<line>But if the Cause be not good, the King him-&#383;elfe hath a heauie Reckoning to make, when all those Legges, and Armes, and Heads, chopt off in a Battaile, &#383;hall ioyne together at the latter day, and cry all, Wee dy-ed at &#383;uch a place, &#383;ome &#383;wearing, &#383;ome crying for a Sur-gean; &#383;ome vpon their Wiues, left poore behind them; &#383;ome vpon the Debts they owe, &#383;ome vpon their Children rawly left: I am afear&#8217;d, there are few dye well, that dye in a Battaile: for how can they charitably dispose of any thing, when Blood is their argument? Now, if these men doe not dye well, it will be a black matter for the King, that led them to it; who to disobey, were against all pro-portion of &#383;ubiection.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>So, if a Sonne that is by his Father &#383;ent about Merchandize, doe &#383;infully miscarry vpon the Sea; the im-putation of his wickedne&#383;&#383;e, by your rule, &#383;hould be im-posed vpon his Father that &#383;ent him: or if a Seruant, vn-der his Masters command, transporting a &#383;umme of Mo-ney, be a&#383;&#383;ayled by Robbers, and dye in many irreconcil&#8217;d Iniquities; you may call the busine&#383;&#383;e of the Master the author of the Seruants damnation: but this is not &#383;o: The King is not bound to an&#383;wer the particular endings of his Souldiers, the Father of his Sonne, nor the Master of his Seruant; for they purpose not their death, when they purpose their &#383;eruices. Besides, there is no King, be his Cause neuer &#383;o &#383;potle&#383;&#383;e, if it come to the arbitre-ment of Swords, can trye it out with all vnspotted Soul-diers: &#383;ome (peraduenture) haue on them the guilt of premeditated and contriued Murther; &#383;ome, of begui-ling Virgins with the broken Seales of Periurie; &#383;ome, making the Warres their Bulwarke, that haue before go-red the gentle Bosome of Peace with Pillage and Robbe-rie. Now, if these men haue defeated the Law, and out-runne Natiue punishment; though they can out-strip men, they haue no wings to flye from God. Warre is his Beadle, Warre is his Vengeance: &#383;o that here men are punisht, for before breach of the Kings Lawes, in now the Kings Quarrell: where they feared the death, they haue borne life away; and where they would bee &#383;afe, they perish. Then if they dye vnprouided, no more is the King guiltie of their damnation, then hee was be-fore guiltie of those Impieties, for the which they are now visited. Euery Subiects Dutie is the Kings, but euery Subiects Soule is his owne. Therefore &#383;hould euery Souldier in the Warres doe as euery &#383;icke man in his Bed, wash euery Moth out of his Conscience: and dying &#383;o, Death is to him aduantage; or not dying, the time was ble&#383;&#383;edly lost, wherein &#383;uch preparation was gayned: and in him that escapes, it were not &#383;inne to thinke, that making God &#383;o free an offer, he let him out-liue that day, to &#383;ee his Greatne&#383;&#383;e, and to teach others how they &#383;hould prepare.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Will.</speaker>
<line>&#8216;Tis certaine, euery man that dyes ill, the ill vpon his owne head, the King is not to an&#383;wer it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Bates.</speaker>
<line>I doe not desire hee &#383;hould an&#383;wer for me, and yet I determine to fight lustily for him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>I my &#383;elfe heard the King &#383;ay he would not be ransom&#8217;d.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Will.</speaker>
<line>I, hee &#383;aid &#383;o, to make vs fight chearefully: but when our throats are cut, hee may be ransom&#8217;d, and wee ne're the wiser.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>If I liue to &#383;ee it, I will neuer trust his word af-ter.</line>
</speech>

Vpon the King, let vs our Liues, our Soules, Our Debts, our carefull Wiues, Our Children, and our Sinnes, lay on the King: We must beare all. O hard Condition, Twin-borne with Greatne&#383;&#383;e, Subiect to the breath of euery foole, whose &#383;ence No more can feele, but his owne wringing. What infinite hearts-ease must Kings neglect, That priuate men enioy? And what haue Kings, that Priuates haue not too, Saue Ceremonie, &#383;aue generall Ceremonie? And what art thou, thou Idoll Ceremonie? What kind of God art thou? that &#383;uffer'st more Of mortall griefes, then doe thy worshippers. What are thy Rents? what are thy Commings in? O Ceremonie, &#383;hew me but thy worth. What? is thy Soule of Odoration? Art thou ought else but Place, Degree, and Forme, Creating awe and feare in other men? Wherein thou art le&#383;&#383;e happy, being fear&#8217;d, Then they in fearing. What drink'st thou oft, in &#383;tead of Homage &#383;weet, But poyson&#8217;d flatterie? O, be &#383;ick, great Greatne&#383;&#383;e, And bid thy Ceremonie giue thee cure. Thinks thou the fierie Feuer will goe out With Titles blowne from Adulation? Will it giue place to flexure and low bending? Canst thou, when thou command'st the beggers knee, Command the health of it? No, thou prowd Dreame, That play'st &#383;o &#383;ubtilly with a Kings Repose. I am a King that find thee: and I know, &#8216;Tis not the Balme, the Scepter, and the Ball, The Sword, the Mase, the Crowne Imperiall, The enter-ti&#383;&#383;ued Robe of Gold and Pearle, The farsed Title running 'fore the King, The Throne he &#383;its on: nor the Tyde of Pompe, That beates vpon the high &#383;hore of this World: No, not all these, thrice-gorgeous Ceremonie; Not all these, lay&#8217;d in Bed Maiesticall, Can &#383;leepe &#383;o &#383;oundly, as the wretched Slaue: Who with a body fill&#8217;d, and vacant mind, Gets him to rest, cram&#8217;d with distre&#383;&#383;efull bread, Neuer &#383;ees horride Night, the Child of Hell: But like a Lacquey, from the Rise to Set, Sweates in the eye of Phebus; and all Night Sleepes in Elizium: next day after dawne, Doth rise and helpe Hiperio[n] to his Horse, And followes &#383;o the euer-running yeere With profitable labour to his Graue: And but for Ceremonie, &#383;uch a Wretch, Winding vp Dayes with toyle, and Nights with &#383;leepe, Had the fore-hand and vantage of a King. The Slaue, a Member of the Countreyes peace, Enioyes it; but in gro&#383;&#383;e braine little wots, What watch the King keepes, to maintaine the peace; Whose howres, the Pesant best aduantages.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Gow.</speaker>
<line>Tis certaine, there's not a boy left aliue, and the Cowardly Rascalls that ranne from the battaile ha' done this &#383;laughter: besides they haue burned and carried a-way all that was in the Kings Tent, wherefore the King mo&#8217;t worthily hath caus&#8217;d euery &#383;oldiour to cut his pri-soners throat. O &#8216;tis a gallant King.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Flu.</speaker>
<line>I, hee was porne at Monmouth Captaine Gower: What call you the Townes name where Alexander the pig was borne?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Gow.</speaker>
<line>Alexander the Great.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Flu.</speaker>
<line>Why I pray you, is not pig, great? The pig, or the great, or the mighty, or the huge, or the magnani-mous, are all one reckonings, &#383;aue the phrase is a litle va-riations. _</line>

<line>I thinke Alexander the Great was borne in Macedon, his Father was called Phillip of Macedon, as I take it.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Flu.</speaker>
<line>I thinke it is in Macedon where Alexander is porne: I tell you Captaine, if you looke in the Maps of the Orld, I warrant you &#383;all finde in the comparisons be-tweene Macedon &amp; Monmouth, that the &#383;ituations looke you, is both alike. There is a Riuer in Macedon, &amp; there is also moreouer a Riuer at Monmouth, it is call&#8217;d Wye at Monmouth: but it is out of my praines, what is the name of the other Riuer: but &#8216;tis all one, tis alike as my fingers is to my fingers, and there is Salmons in both. If you marke Alexanders life well, Harry of Monmouthes life is come after it indifferent well, for there is figures in all things. Alexander God knowes, and you know, in his rages, and his furies, and his wraths, and his chollers, and his moodes, and his displeasures, and his indignations, and also being a little intoxicates in his praines, did in his Ales and his angers (looke you) kill his best friend Clytus.</line>

<speaker>Gow.</speaker>
<line>Our King is not like him in that, he neuer kill&#8217;d any of his friends.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Flu.</speaker>
<line>It is not well done (marke you now) to take the tales out of my mouth, ere it is made and finished. I &#383;peak but in the figures, and comparisons of it: as Alexander kild his friend Clytus, being in his Ales and his Cuppes; &#383;o also Harry Monmouth being in his right wittes, and his good iudgements, turn&#8217;d away the fat Knight with the great belly doublet: he was full of iests, and gypes, and knaueries, and mockes, I haue forgot his name.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<line>Ouy verayment (sauf vostre Grace) ainsi dit il.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>I &#383;aid &#383;o, deare Katherine, and I must not blush to affirme it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Kath.</speaker>
<line>O bon Dieu, les langues des hommes &#383;ont plein de tromperies.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>What &#383;ayes &#383;he, faire one? that the tongues of men are full of deceits?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Lady.</speaker>
<line>Ouy, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of de-ceits: dat is de Prince&#383;&#383;e.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>The Prince&#383;&#383;e is the better English-woman: yfaith Kate, my wooing is fit for thy vnderstanding, I am glad thou canst &#383;peake no better English, for if thou could'st, thou would'st finde me &#383;uch a plaine King, that thou wouldst thinke, I had &#383;old my Farme to buy my Crowne. I know no wayes to mince it in loue, but di-rectly to &#383;ay, I loue you; then if you vrge me farther, then to &#383;ay, Doe you in faith? I weare out my &#383;uite: Giue me your an&#383;wer, yfaith doe, and &#383;o clap hands, and a bar-gaine: how &#383;ay you, Lady?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Kath.</speaker>
<line>Sauf vostre honeur, me vnderstand well.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>Marry, if you would put me to Verses, or to Dance for your &#383;ake, Kate, why you vndid me: for the one I haue neither words nor measure; and for the other, I haue no &#383;trength in measure, yet a reasonable measure in &#383;trength. If I could winne a Lady at Leape-frogge, or by vawting into my Saddle, with my Armour on my backe; vnder the correction of bragging be it &#383;poken. I &#383;hould quickly leape into a Wife: Or if I might buffet for my Loue, or bound my Horse for her fauours, I could lay on like a Butcher, and &#383;it like a Iack an Apes, neuer off. But before God Kate, I cannot looke greenely, nor gaspe out my eloquence, nor I haue no cunning in protestation; onely downe-right Oathes, which I neuer vse till vrg&#8217;d, nor neuer breake for vrging. If thou canst loue a fellow of this temper, Kate, whose face is not worth Sunne-bur-ning? that neuer lookes in his Gla&#383;&#383;e, for loue of any thing he &#383;ees there? let thine Eye be thy Cooke. I &#383;peake to thee plaine Souldier: If thou canst loue me for this, take me? if not? to &#383;ay to thee that I &#383;hall dye, is true; but for thy loue, by the L[ord]. No: yet I loue thee too. And while thou liu'st, deare Kate, take a fellow of plaine and vncoyned Constancie, for he perforce must do thee right, because he hath not the gift to wo&#339; in other places: for these fellowes of infinit tongue, that can ryme themselues into Ladyes fauours, they doe alwayes reason themselues out againe. What? a &#383;peaker is but a prater, a Ryme is but a Ballad; a good Legge will fall, a &#383;trait Backe will &#383;toope, a blacke Beard will turne white, a curl&#8217;d Pate will grow bald, a faire Face will wither, a full Eye will wax hollow: but a good Heart, Kate, is the Sunne and the Moone, or rather the Sunne, and not the Moone; for it &#383;hines bright, and neuer changes, but keepes his course truly. If thou would haue &#383;uch a one, take me? and take me; take a Souldier: take a Souldier; take a King. And what &#383;ay'st thou then to my Loue? &#383;peake my faire, and fairely, I pray thee.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Kath.</speaker>
<line>Is it po&#383;&#383;ible dat I &#383;ould loue de ennemie of</line>
<line>Fraunce?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>No, it is not po&#383;&#383;ible you &#383;hould loue the Ene-mie of France, Kate; but in louing me, you &#383;hould loue the Friend of France: for I loue France &#383;o well, that I will not part with a Village of it; I will haue it all mine: and Kate, when France is mine, and I am yours; then yours is France, and you are mine.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Kath.</speaker>
<line>I cannot tell wat is dat.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>No, Kate? I will tell thee in French, which I am &#383;ure will hang vpon my tongue, like a new-married Wife about her Husbands Necke, hardly to be &#383;hooke off; Ie quand &#383;ur le po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ion de Fraunce, &amp; quand vous aues le pos-se&#383;&#383;ion de moy. (Let mee &#383;ee, what then? Saint Dennis bee my &#383;peede) Donc vostre est Fraunce, &amp; vous estes mienne. It is as easie for me, Kate, to conquer the Kingdome, as to &#383;peake &#383;o much more French: I &#383;hall neuer moue thee in French, vnle&#383;&#383;e it be to laugh at me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Kath.</speaker>
<line>Sauf vostre honeur, le Francois ques vous parleis, il</line>
<line>melieus que l' Anglois le quel Ie parle.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>No faith is't not, Kate: but thy &#383;peaking of my Tongue, and I thine, mo&#8217;t truely falsely, must needes be graunted to be much at one. But Kate, doo'st thou vnderstand thus much English? Canst thou loue mee?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Kath.</speaker>
<line>I cannot tell.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>Can any of your Neighbours tell, Kate? Ile aske them. Come, I know thou louest me: and at night, when you come into your Closet, you'le question this Gentlewoman about me; and I know, Kate, you will to her disprayse those parts in me, that you loue with your heart: but good Kate, mocke me mercifully, the rather gentle Prince&#383;&#383;e, because I loue thee cruelly. If euer thou beest mine, Kate, as I haue a &#383;auing Faith within me tells me thou &#383;halt; I get thee with &#383;kambling, and thou must therefore needes proue a good Souldier-breeder: Shall not thou and I, betweene Saint Dennis and Saint George, compound a Boy, halfe French halfe English, that &#383;hall goe to Constantinople, and take the Turke by the Beard. Shall wee not? what &#383;ay'st thou, my faire Flower-de-Luce.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Kate.</speaker>
<line>I doe not know dat.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>No: &#8216;tis hereafter to know, but now to promise: doe but now promise Kate, you will endeauour for your French part of &#383;uch a Boy; and for my English moytie, take the Word of a King, and a Batcheler. How an&#383;wer you. La plus belle Katherine du monde mon trescher &amp; deuin dee&#383;&#383;e.</line>
</speech>

<speech>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>Now fye vpon my false French: by mine Honor in true English, I loue thee Kate; by which Honor, I dare not &#383;weare thou louest me, yet my blood begins to flat-ter me, that thou doo'st; notwithstanding the poore and vntempering effect of my Visage. Now beshrew my Fathers Ambition, hee was thinking of Ciuill Warres when hee got me, therefore was I created with a &#383;tub-borne out-side, with an aspect of Iron, that when I come to wo&#339; Ladyes, I fright them: but in faith Kate, the el-der I wax, the better I &#383;hall appeare. My comfort is, that Old Age, that ill layer vp of Beautie, can doe no more &#383;poyle vpon my Face. Thou hast me, if thou hast me, at the worst; and thou &#383;halt weare me, if thou weare me, better and better: and therefore tell me, mo&#8217;t faire Ka-therine, will you haue me? Put off your Maiden Blushes, auouch the Thoughts of your Heart with the Lookes of an Empre&#383;&#383;e, take me by the Hand, and &#383;ay, Harry of England, I am thine: which Word thou &#383;halt no &#383;ooner ble&#383;&#383;e mine Eare withall, but I will tell thee alowd, Eng-land is thine, Ireland is thine, France is thine, and Henry Plantaginet is thine; who, though I &#383;peake it before his Face, if he be not Fellow with the best King, thou &#383;halt finde the best King of Good-fellowes. Come your An-swer in broken Musick; for thy Voyce is Musick, and thy English broken: Therefore Queene of all, Katherine, breake thy minde to me in broken English; wilt thou haue me?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Kath.</speaker>
<line>Dat is as it &#383;hall please de Roy mon pere.</line>

<line>O Kate, nice Customes cursie to great Kings. Deare Kate, you and I cannot bee confin&#8217;d within the weake Lyst of a Countreyes fashion: wee are the ma-kers of Manners, Kate; and the libertie that followes our Places, &#383;toppes the mouth of all finde-faults, as I will doe yours, for vpholding the nice fashion of your Countrey, in denying me a Ki&#383;&#383;e: therefore patiently, and yeelding. You haue Witch-craft in your Lippes, Kate: there is more eloquence in a Sugar touch of them, then in the Tongues of the French Councell; and they &#383;hould &#383;ooner perswade Harry of England, then a generall Petition of Monarchs. Heere comes your Father.</line>
</speech>

<line>I would haue her learne, my faire Cousin, how perfectly I loue her, and that is good English.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Burg.</speaker>
<line>Is &#383;hee not apt?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>Our Tongue is rough, Coze, and my Conditi-on is not &#383;mooth: &#383;o that hauing neyther the Voyce nor the Heart of Flatterie about me, I cannot &#383;o coniure vp the Spirit of Loue in her, that hee will appeare in his true likene&#383;&#383;e.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Burg.</speaker>
<line>Pardon the frankne&#383;&#383;e of my mirth, if I an&#383;wer you for that. If you would coniure in her, you must make a Circle: if coniure vp Loue in her in his true likene&#383;&#383;e, hee must appeare naked, and blinde. Can you blame her then, being a Maid, yet ros&#8217;d ouer with the Virgin Crimson of Modestie, if &#383;hee deny the apparance of a naked blinde Boy in her naked &#383;eeing &#383;elfe? It were (my Lord) a hard Condition for a Maid to consigne to.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>Yet they doe winke and yeeld, as Loue is blind and enforces.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Burg.</speaker>
<line>They are then excus&#8217;d, my Lord, when they &#383;ee not what they doe.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>Then good my Lord, teach your Cousin to consent winking.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Burg.</speaker>
<line>I will winke on her to consent, my Lord, if you will teach her to know my meaning: for Maides well Summer&#8217;d, and warme kept, are like Flyes at Bartholo-mew-tyde, blinde, though they haue their eyes, and then they will endure handling, which before would not abide looking on.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>This Morall tyes me ouer to Time, and a hot Summer; and &#383;o I &#383;hall catch the Flye, your Cousin, in the latter end, and &#383;he must be blinde to.</line>
