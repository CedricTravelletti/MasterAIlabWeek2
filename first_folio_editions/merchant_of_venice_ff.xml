<LINE>In &#383;ooth I know not why I am &#383;o &#383;ad,</LINE>
<LINE>It wearies me: you &#383;ay it wearies you;</LINE>
<LINE>But how I caught it, found it, or came by it,</LINE>
<LINE>What &#383;tuffe &#8217;tis made of, whereof it is borne,</LINE>
<LINE>I am to learne: and &#383;uch a Want-wit &#383;adne&#383;&#383;e makes of mee,</LINE>

<LINE>Beleeue me &#383;ir, had I &#383;uch venture forth,</LINE>
<LINE>The better part of my affe&#392;tions, would</LINE>

<LINE>Plucking the gra&#383;&#383;e to know where &#383;its the winde,</LINE>
<LINE>Peering in Maps for ports, and peers, and rodes:</LINE>
<LINE>And euery obie&#392;t that might make me feare</LINE>
<LINE>Mi&#383;fortune to my ventures, out of doubt</LINE>
<LINE>Would make me &#383;ad.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Sal.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My winde cooling my broth,</LINE>
<LINE>Would blow me to an Ague, when I thought</LINE>

<LINE>Enrobe the roring waters with my &#383;ilkes,</LINE>
<LINE>And in a word, but euen now worth this,</LINE>
<LINE>And now worth nothing. Shall I haue the thought</LINE>

<LINE>It ble&#383;&#383;eth him that giues, and him that takes,</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis mightie&#383;t in the mightie&#383;t, it becomes</LINE>
<LINE>The throned Monarch better then his Crowne.</LINE>

<LINE>The attribute to awe and Maie&#383;tie,</LINE>
<LINE>Wherein doth &#383;it the dread and feare of Kings:</LINE>
<LINE>But mercy is aboue this &#383;ceptred &#383;way,</LINE>
<LINE>It is enthroned in the hearts of Kings,</LINE>
<LINE>It is an attribute to God him&#383;elfe;</LINE>
<LINE>And earthly power doth then &#383;hew like&#383;t Gods</LINE>
