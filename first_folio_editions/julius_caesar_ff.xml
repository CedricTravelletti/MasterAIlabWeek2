<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Brut.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am not Gamesom: I do lacke &#383;ome part</LINE>

<LINE>Let me not hinder Ca&#383;&#383;ius your desires;</LINE>
<LINE>Ile leaue you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Ca&#383;&#383;i.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Brutus, I do obserue you now of late:</LINE>
<LINE>I haue not from your eyes, that gentlene&#383;&#383;e</LINE>
<LINE>And &#383;hew of Loue, as I was wont to haue:</LINE>
<LINE>You beare too &#383;tubborne, and too &#383;trange a hand</LINE>
<LINE>Ouer your Friend, that loues you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Bru.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ca&#383;&#383;ius,</LINE>
<LINE>Be not deceiu&#8217;d: If I haue veyl&#8217;d my looke,</LINE>
<LINE>I turne the trouble of my Countenance</LINE>
<LINE>Meerely vpon my &#383;elfe. Vexed I am</LINE>
<LINE>Of late, with pa&#383;&#383;ions of &#383;ome difference,</LINE>
<LINE>Conceptions onely proper to my &#383;elfe,</LINE>
<LINE>Which giue &#383;ome &#383;oyle (perhaps) to my Behauiours:</LINE>
<LINE>But let not therefore my good Friends be greeu&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>(Among which number Ca&#383;&#383;ius be you one)</LINE>
<LINE>Nor construe any further my neglect,</LINE>
<LINE>Then that poore Brutus with himselfe at warre,</LINE>
<LINE>Forgets the &#383;hewes of Loue to other men.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Ca&#383;&#383;i.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then Brutus, I haue much mistook your pa&#383;&#383;ion,</LINE>
<LINE>By meanes whereof, this Brest of mine hath buried</LINE>
<LINE>Thoughts of great value, worthy Cogitations.</LINE>
<LINE>Tell me good Brutus, Can you &#383;ee your face?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Brutus.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No Ca&#383;&#383;ius:</LINE>
<LINE>For the eye &#383;ees not it &#383;elfe but by reflection,</LINE>
<LINE>By &#383;ome other things.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Ca&#383;&#383;ius.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8216;Tis iust,</LINE>
<LINE>And it is very much lamented Brutus,</LINE>
<LINE>That you haue no &#383;uch Mirrors, as will turne</LINE>
<LINE>Your hidden worthine&#383;&#383;e into your eye,</LINE>
<LINE>That you might &#383;ee your &#383;hadow:</LINE>
<LINE>I haue heard,</LINE>
<LINE>Where many of the best respect in Rome,</LINE>
<LINE>(Except immortall Caesar) &#383;peaking of Brutus,</LINE>
<LINE>And groaning vnderneath this Ages yoake,</LINE>
<LINE>Haue wish&#8217;d, that Noble Brutus had his eyes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Bru.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Into what dangers, would you</LINE>
<LINE>Leade me Ca&#383;&#383;ius?</LINE>
<LINE>That you would haue me &#383;eeke into my &#383;elfe,</LINE>
<LINE>For that which is not in me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Cas.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Therefore good Brutus, be prepar&#8217;d to heare:</LINE>
<LINE>And &#383;ince you know, you cannot &#383;ee your &#383;elfe</LINE>
<LINE>So well as by Reflection; I your Gla&#383;&#383;e,</LINE>
<LINE>Will modestly discouer to your &#383;elfe</LINE>
<LINE>That of your &#383;elfe, which you yet know not of.</LINE>
<LINE>And be not iealous on me, gentle Brutus:</LINE>
<LINE>Were I a common Laughter, or did vse</LINE>
<LINE>To &#383;tale with ordinary Oathes my loue</LINE>
<LINE>To euery new Protester: if you know,</LINE>
<LINE>That I do fawne on men, and hugge them hard,</LINE>
<LINE>And after &#383;candall them: Or if you know,</LINE>
<LINE>That I profe&#383;&#383;e my &#383;elfe in Banquetting</LINE>
<LINE>To all the Rout, then hold me dangerous.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Flourish, and Shout.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Bru.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What meanes this Showting?</LINE>
<LINE>I do feare, the People choose Caesar</LINE>
<LINE>For their King.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Ca&#383;&#383;i.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I, do you feare it?</LINE>
<LINE>Then must I thinke you would not haue it &#383;o.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Bru.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would not Ca&#383;&#383;ius, yet I loue him well:</LINE>
<LINE>But wherefore do you hold me heere &#383;o long?</LINE>
<LINE>What is it, that you would impart to me?</LINE>
<LINE>If it be ought toward the generall good,</LINE>
<LINE>Set Honor in one eye, and Death i'th other,</LINE>
<LINE>And I will looke on both indifferently:</LINE>
<LINE>For let the Gods &#383;o &#383;peed mee, as I loue</LINE>
<LINE>The name of Honor, more then I feare death.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Ca&#383;&#383;i.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know that vertue to be in you Brutus,</LINE>
<LINE>As well as I do know your outward fauour.</LINE>
<LINE>Well, Honor is the &#383;ubiect of my Story:</LINE>
<LINE>I cannot tell, what you and other men</LINE>
<LINE>Thinke of this life: But for my &#383;ingle &#383;elfe,</LINE>
<LINE>I had as liefe not be, as liue to be</LINE>
<LINE>In awe of &#383;uch a Thing, as I my &#383;elfe.</LINE>
<LINE>I was borne free as Caesar, &#383;o were you,</LINE>
<LINE>We both haue fed as well, and we can both</LINE>
<LINE>Endure the Winters cold, as well as hee.</LINE>
<LINE>For once, vpon a Rawe and Gustie day,</LINE>
<LINE>The troubled Tyber, chafing with her Shores,</LINE>
<LINE>Caesar &#383;aide to me, Dar'st thou Ca&#383;&#383;ius now</LINE>
<LINE>Leape in with me into this angry Flood,</LINE>
<LINE>And &#383;wim to yonder Point? Vpon the word,</LINE>
<LINE>Accoutred as I was, I plunged in,</LINE>
<LINE>And bad him follow: &#383;o indeed he did.</LINE>
<LINE>The Torrent roar&#8217;d, and we did buffet it</LINE>
<LINE>With lusty Sinewes, throwing it aside,</LINE>
<LINE>And &#383;temming it with hearts of Controuersie.</LINE>
<LINE>But ere we could arriue the Point propos&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Caesar cride, Helpe me Ca&#383;&#383;ius, or I &#383;inke.</LINE>
<LINE>I (as Aeneas, our great Ancestor,</LINE>
<LINE>Did from the Flames of Troy, vpon his &#383;houlder</LINE>
<LINE>The old Anchyses beare) &#383;o, from the waues of Tyber</LINE>
<LINE>Did I the tyred Caesar: And this Man,</LINE>
<LINE>Is now become a God, and Ca&#383;&#383;ius is</LINE>
<LINE>A wretched Creature, and must bend his body,</LINE>
<LINE>If Caesar carelesly but nod on him.</LINE>
<LINE>He had a Feauer when he was in Spaine,</LINE>
<LINE>And when the Fit was on him, I did marke</LINE>
<LINE>How he did &#383;hake: Tis true, this God did &#383;hake,</LINE>
<LINE>His Coward lippes did from their colour flye,</LINE>
<LINE>And that &#383;ame Eye, whose bend doth awe the World,</LINE>
<LINE>Did loose his Lustre: I did heare him grone:</LINE>
<LINE>I, and that Tongue of his, that bad the Romans</LINE>
<LINE>Marke him, and write his Speeches in their Bookes,</LINE>
<LINE>Alas, it cried, Giue me &#383;ome drinke Titinius,</LINE>
<LINE>As a &#383;icke Girle: Ye Gods, it doth amaze me,</LINE>
<LINE>A man of &#383;uch a feeble temper &#383;hould</LINE>
<LINE>So get the &#383;tart of the Maiesticke world,</LINE>
<LINE>And beare the Palme alone.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Shout. Flourish.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Bru.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Another generall &#383;hout?</LINE>
<LINE>I do beleeue, that these applauses are</LINE>
<LINE>For &#383;ome new Honors, that are heap&#8217;d on Caesar.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Ca&#383;&#383;i.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why man, he doth bestride the narrow world</LINE>
<LINE>Like a Colo&#383;&#383;us, and we petty men</LINE>
<LINE>Walke vnder his huge legges, and peepe about</LINE>
<LINE>To finde our &#383;elues dishonourable Graues.</LINE>
<LINE>Men at &#383;ometime, are Masters of their Fates.</LINE>
<LINE>The fault (deere Brutus) is not in our Starres,</LINE>
<LINE>But in our Selues, that we are vnderlings.</LINE>
<LINE>Brutus and Caesar: What &#383;hould be in that Caesar?</LINE>
<LINE>Why &#383;hould that name be &#383;ounded more then yours</LINE>
<LINE>Write them together: Yours, is as faire a Name:</LINE>
<LINE>Sound them, it doth become the mouth aswell:</LINE>
<LINE>Weigh them, it is as heauy: Coniure with 'em,</LINE>
<LINE>Brutus will &#383;tart a Spirit as &#383;oone as Caesar.</LINE>
<LINE>Now in the names of all the Gods at once,</LINE>
<LINE>Vpon what meate doth this our Caesar feede,</LINE>
<LINE>That he is growne &#383;o great? Age, thou art &#383;ham&#8217;d.</LINE>
<LINE>Rome, thou hast lost the breed of Noble Bloods.</LINE>
<LINE>When went there by an Age, &#383;ince the great Flood,</LINE>
<LINE>But it was fam&#8217;d with more then with one man?</LINE>
<LINE>When could they &#383;ay (till now) that talk&#8217;d of Rome,</LINE>
<LINE>That her wide Walkes incompast but one man?</LINE>
<LINE>Now is it Rome indeed, and Roome enough</LINE>
<LINE>When there is in it but one onely man.</LINE>
<LINE>O! you and I, haue heard our Fathers &#383;ay,</LINE>
<LINE>There was a Brutus once, that would haue brook&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>Th&#8217; eternall Diuell to keepe his State in Rome,</LINE>
<LINE>As easily as a King.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Bru.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That you do loue me, I am nothing iealous:</LINE>
<LINE>What you would worke me too, I haue &#383;ome ayme:</LINE>
<LINE>How I haue thought of this, and of these times</LINE>
<LINE>I &#383;hall recount heereafter. For this present,</LINE>
<LINE>I would not &#383;o (with loue I might intreat you)</LINE>
<LINE>Be any further moou&#8217;d: What you haue &#383;aid,</LINE>
<LINE>I will consider: what you haue to &#383;ay</LINE>
<LINE>I will with patience heare, and finde a time</LINE>
<LINE>Both meete to heare, and an&#383;wer &#383;uch high things.</LINE>
<LINE>Till then, my Noble Friend, chew vpon this:</LINE>
<LINE>Brutus had rather be a Villager,</LINE>
<LINE>Then to repute himselfe a Sonne of Rome</LINE>
<LINE>Vnder these hard Conditions, as this time</LINE>
<LINE>Is like to lay vpon vs.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Ca&#383;&#383;i.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am glad that my weake words</LINE>
<LINE>Haue &#383;trucke but thus much &#383;hew of fire from Brutus,</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Caesar and his Traine.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>The Games are done,</LINE>

<LINE>Plucke Caska by the Sleeue,</LINE>

<LINE>What hath proceeded worthy note to day.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Bru.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will do &#383;o: but looke you Ca&#383;&#383;ius,</LINE>
<LINE>The angry &#383;pot doth glow on Caesars brow,</LINE>
<LINE>And all the rest, looke like a chidden Traine;</LINE>
<LINE>Calphurnia's Cheeke is pale, and Cicero</LINE>
<LINE>Lookes with &#383;uch Ferret, and &#383;uch fiery eyes</LINE>
<LINE>As we haue &#383;eene him in the Capitoll</LINE>
<LINE>Being crost in Conference, by &#383;ome Senators.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Caes.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let me haue men about me, that are fat,</LINE>
<LINE>Sleeke-headed men, and &#383;uch as &#383;leepe a-nights:</LINE>
<LINE>Yond Ca&#383;&#383;ius has a leane and hungry looke,</LINE>
<LINE>He thinkes too much: &#383;uch men are dangerous.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Ant.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Feare him not Caesar, he's not dangerous,</LINE>
<LINE>He is a Noble Roman, and well giuen.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Caes.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Would he were fatter; But I feare him not:</LINE>
<LINE>Yet if my name were lyable to feare,</LINE>
<LINE>I do not know the man I &#383;hould auoyd</LINE>
<LINE>So &#383;oone as that &#383;pare Ca&#383;&#383;ius. He reades much,</LINE>
<LINE>He is a great Obseruer, and he lookes</LINE>
<LINE>Quite through the Deeds of men. He loues no Playes,</LINE>
<LINE>As thou dost Antony: he heares no Musicke;</LINE>
<LINE>Seldome he &#383;miles, and &#383;miles in &#383;uch a &#383;ort</LINE>
<LINE>As if he mock&#8217;d himselfe, and &#383;corn&#8217;d his &#383;pirit</LINE>
<LINE>That could be mou&#8217;d to &#383;mile at any thing.</LINE>
<LINE>Such men as he, be neuer at hearts ease,</LINE>
<LINE>Whiles they behold a greater then themselues,</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore are they very dangerous.</LINE>
<LINE>I rather tell thee what is to be fear&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Then what I feare: for alwayes I am Caesar.</LINE>
<LINE>Come on my right hand, for this eare is deafe,</LINE>
<LINE>And tell me truely, what thou think'st of him.</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>I Caska, tell vs what hath chanc&#8217;d to day</LINE>
<LINE>That Caesar lookes &#383;o &#383;ad.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Cask.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why you were with him, were you not?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Bru.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I &#383;hould not then aske Caska what had chanc&#8217;d.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Cask.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why there was a Crowne offer&#8217;d him; &amp; being offer&#8217;d him, he put it by with the backe of his hand thus, and then the people fell a &#383;houting.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Bru.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What was the &#383;econd noyse for?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Cask.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why for that too.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Ca&#383;&#383;i.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>They &#383;houted thrice: what was the last cry for?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Cask.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why for that too.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Bru.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Was the Crowne offer&#8217;d him thrice?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Cask.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I marry was't, and hee put it by thrice, euerie time gentler then other; and at euery putting by, mine hone&#383;t Neighbors &#383;howted.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Ca&#383;&#383;i.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who offer&#8217;d him the Crowne?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Cask.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why Antony.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Bru.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tell vs the manner of it, gentle Caska.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Caska.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I can as well bee hang&#8217;d as tell the manner of it: It was meere Foolerie, I did not marke it. I &#383;awe Marke Antony offer him a Crowne, yet 'twas not a Crowne neyther, 'twas one of these Coronets: and as I told you, hee put it by once: but for all that, to my thin-king, he would faine haue had it. Then hee offered it to him againe: then hee put it by againe: but to my think-ing, he was very loath to lay his fingers off it. And then he offered it the third time; hee put it the third time by, and &#383;till as hee refus&#8217;d it, the rabblement howted, and clapp&#8217;d their chopt hands, and threw vppe their &#383;weatie Night-cappes, and vttered &#383;uch a deale of &#383;tinking breath, because Caesar refus&#8217;d the Crowne, that it had (almost) choaked Caesar: for hee &#383;woonded, and fell downe at it: And for mine owne part, I durst not laugh, for feare of opening my Lippes, and receyuing the bad Ayre.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Ca&#383;&#383;i.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But &#383;oft I pray you: what, did Caesar &#383;wound?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Cask.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He fell downe in the Market-place, and foam&#8217;d at mouth, and was &#383;peechle&#383;&#383;e.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Brut.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8216;Tis very like he hath the Falling &#383;ickne&#383;&#383;e.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Ca&#383;&#383;i.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, Caesar hath it not: but you, and I,</LINE>
<LINE>And hone&#383;t Caska, we haue the Falling &#383;ickne&#383;&#383;e.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Cask.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know not what you meane by that, but I am &#383;ure Caesar fell downe. If the tag-ragge people did not clap him, and hi&#383;&#383;e him, according as he pleas&#8217;d, and dis-pleas&#8217;d them, as they vse to doe the Players in the Thea-tre, I am no true man.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Brut.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What &#383;aid he, when he came vnto himselfe?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Cask.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, before he fell downe, when he perceiu&#8217;d the common Heard was glad he refus&#8217;d the Crowne, he pluckt me ope his Doublet, and offer&#8217;d them his Throat to cut: and I had beene a man of any Occupation, if I would not haue taken him at a word, I would I might goe to Hell among the Rogues, and &#383;o hee fell. When he came to himselfe againe, hee &#383;aid, If hee had done, or &#383;aid any thing ami&#383;&#383;e, he desir&#8217;d their Worships to thinke it was his infirmitie. Three or foure Wenches where I &#383;tood, cryed, Ala&#383;&#383;e good Soule, and forgaue him with all their hearts: But there's no heed to be taken of them; if Caesar had &#383;tab&#8217;d their Mothers, they would haue done no le&#383;&#383;e.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Brut.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And after that, he came thus &#383;ad away.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Cask.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Ca&#383;&#383;i.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Did Cicero &#383;ay any thing?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Ca&#383;&#383;i.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To what effect?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Cask.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, and I tell you that, Ile ne're looke you i'th&#8217; face againe. But those that vnderstood him, &#383;mil&#8217;d at one another, and &#383;hooke their heads: but for mine owne part, it was Greeke to me. I could tell you more newes too: Murrellus and Flauius, for pulling Scarffes off Caesars Images, are put to &#383;ilence. Fare you well. There was more Foolerie yet, if I could remem-ber it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Ca&#383;&#383;i.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Will you &#383;uppe with me to Night, Caska?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>No, I am promis&#8217;d forth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Ca&#383;&#383;i.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Will you Dine with me to morrow?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Cask.</SPEAKER>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Brut.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What a blunt fellow is this growne to be?</LINE>
<LINE>He was quick Mettle, when he went to Schoole.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Ca&#383;&#383;i.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So is he now, in execution</LINE>
<LINE>Of any bold, or Noble Enterprize,</LINE>
<LINE>How-euer he puts on this tardie forme:</LINE>
<LINE>This Rudene&#383;&#383;e is a Sawce to his good Wit,</LINE>
<LINE>Which giues men &#383;tomacke to disgest his words</LINE>
<LINE>With better Appetite.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Brut.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And &#383;o it is:</LINE>
<LINE>For this time I will leaue you:</LINE>
<LINE>To morrow, if you please to &#383;peake with me,</LINE>
<LINE>I will come home to you: or if you will,</LINE>
<LINE>Come home to me, and I will wait for you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Ca&#383;&#383;i.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will doe &#383;o: till then, thinke of the World. <STAGEDIR>Exit Brutus.</STAGEDIR> Well Brutus, thou art Noble: yet I &#383;ee, Thy Honorable Mettle may be wrought From that it is dispos&#8217;d: therefore it is meet, That Noble mindes keepe euer with their likes: For who &#383;o firme, that cannot be &#383;educ&#8217;d? Caesar doth beare me hard, but he loues Brutus. If I were Brutus now, and he were Ca&#383;&#383;ius, He &#383;hould not humor me. I will this Night, In &#383;euerall Hands, in at his Windowes throw, As if they came from &#383;euerall Citizens, Writings, all tending to the great opinion That Rome holds of his Name: wherein obscurely Caesars Ambition &#383;hall be glanced at. And after this, let Caesar &#383;eat him &#383;ure, For wee will &#383;hake him, or worse dayes endure. <STAGEDIR>Exit.</STAGEDIR></LINE>

<LINE>Good euen, Caska: brought you Caesar home?</LINE>
<LINE>Why are you breathle&#383;&#383;e, and why &#383;tare you &#383;o?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Cask.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Are not you mou&#8217;d, when all the &#383;way of Earth</LINE>
<LINE>Shakes, like a thing vnfirme? O Cicero,</LINE>
<LINE>I haue &#383;eene Tempests, when the &#383;colding Winds</LINE>
<LINE>Haue riu&#8217;d the knottie Oakes, and I haue &#383;eene</LINE>
<LINE>Th&#8217; ambitious Ocean &#383;well, and rage, and foame,</LINE>
<LINE>To be exalted with the threatning Clouds:</LINE>
<LINE>But neuer till to Night, neuer till now,</LINE>
<LINE>Did I goe through a Tempest-dropping-fire.</LINE>
<LINE>Eyther there is a Ciuill &#383;trife in Heauen,</LINE>
<LINE>Or else the World, too &#383;awcie with the Gods,</LINE>
<LINE>Incenses them to &#383;end destruction.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Cic.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, &#383;aw you any thing more wonderfull?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Cask.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A common &#383;laue, you know him well by &#383;ight,</LINE>
<LINE>Held vp his left Hand, which did flame and burne</LINE>
<LINE>Like twentie Torches ioyn&#8217;d; and yet his Hand,</LINE>
<LINE>Not &#383;ensible of fire, remain&#8217;d vnscorch&#8217;d.</LINE>
<LINE>Besides, I ha' not &#383;ince put vp my Sword,</LINE>
<LINE>Against the Capitoll I met a Lyon,</LINE>
<LINE>Who glaz&#8217;d vpon me, and went &#383;urly by,</LINE>
<LINE>Without annoying me. And there were drawne</LINE>
<LINE>Vpon a heape, a hundred gastly Women,</LINE>
<LINE>Transformed with their feare, who &#383;wore, they &#383;aw</LINE>
<LINE>Men, all in fire, walke vp and downe the &#383;treetes.</LINE>
<LINE>And yesterday, the Bird of Night did &#383;it,</LINE>
<LINE>Euen at Noone-day, vpon the Market place,</LINE>
<LINE>Howting, and &#383;hreeking. When these Prodigies</LINE>
<LINE>Doe &#383;o conioyntly meet, let not men &#383;ay,</LINE>
<LINE>These are their Reasons, they are Naturall:</LINE>
<LINE>For I beleeue, they are portentous things</LINE>
<LINE>Vnto the Clymate, that they point vpon.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Cic.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Indeed, it is a &#383;trange disposed time:</LINE>
<LINE>But men may construe things after their fashion,</LINE>
<LINE>Cleane from the purpose of the things themselues.</LINE>
<LINE>Comes Caesar to the Capitoll to morrow?</LINE>

<LINE>Good-night then, Caska:</LINE>

<LINE>Your Eare is good.</LINE>
<LINE>Ca&#383;&#383;ius, what Night is this?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Ca&#383;&#383;i.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A very pleasing Night to hone&#383;t men.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Cask.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who euer knew the Heauens menace &#383;o?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Ca&#383;&#383;i.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Those that haue knowne the Earth &#383;o full of faults. For my part, I haue walk&#8217;d about the &#383;treets, Submitting me vnto the perillous Night; And thus vnbraced, Caska, as you &#383;ee, Haue bar&#8217;d my Bosome to the Thunder-stone: And when the cro&#383;&#383;e blew Lightning &#383;eem&#8217;d to open The Brest of Heauen, I did present my &#383;elfe Euen in the ayme, and very flash of it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Cask.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But wherefore did you &#383;o much tempt the Heauens?</LINE>
<LINE>It is the part of men, to feare and tremble,</LINE>
<LINE>When the mo&#8217;t mightie Gods, by tokens &#383;end</LINE>
<LINE>Such dreadfull Heraulds, to astonish vs.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Ca&#383;&#383;i.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You are dull, Caska:</LINE>
<LINE>And those &#383;parkes of Life, that &#383;hould be in a Roman,</LINE>
<LINE>You doe want, or else you vse not.</LINE>
<LINE>You looke pale, and gaze, and put on feare,</LINE>
<LINE>And cast your &#383;elfe in wonder,</LINE>
<LINE>To &#383;ee the &#383;trange impatience of the Heauens:</LINE>
<LINE>But if you would consider the true cause,</LINE>
<LINE>Why all these Fires, why all these gliding Ghosts,</LINE>
<LINE>Why Birds and Beasts, from qualitie and kinde,</LINE>
<LINE>Why Old men, Fooles, and Children calculate,</LINE>
<LINE>Why all these things change from their Ordinance,</LINE>
<LINE>Their Natures, and pre-formed Faculties,</LINE>
<LINE>To monstrous qualitie; why you &#383;hall finde,</LINE>
<LINE>That Heauen hath infus&#8217;d them with these Spirits,</LINE>
<LINE>To make them Instruments of feare, and warning,</LINE>
<LINE>Vnto &#383;ome monstrous State.</LINE>
<LINE>Now could I (Caska) name to thee a man,</LINE>
<LINE>Mo&#8217;t like this dreadfull Night,</LINE>
<LINE>That Thunders, Lightens, opens Graues, and roares,</LINE>
<LINE>As doth the Lyon in the Capitoll:</LINE>
<LINE>A man no mightier then thy &#383;elfe, or me,</LINE>
<LINE>In personall action; yet prodigious growne,</LINE>
<LINE>And fearefull, as these &#383;trange eruptions are.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Cask.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8216;Tis Caesar that you meane:</LINE>
<LINE>Is it not, Ca&#383;&#383;ius?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Ca&#383;&#383;i.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let it be who it is: for Romans now</LINE>
<LINE>Haue Thewes, and Limbes, like to their Ancestors;</LINE>
<LINE>But w&#339; the while, our Fathers mindes are dead,</LINE>
<LINE>And we are gouern&#8217;d with our Mothers &#383;pirits,</LINE>
<LINE>Our yoake, and &#383;ufferance, &#383;hew vs Womanish.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Indeed, they &#383;ay, the Senators to morrow</LINE>
<LINE>Meane to establish Caesar as a King:</LINE>
<LINE>And he &#383;hall weare his Crowne by Sea, and Land,</LINE>
<LINE>In euery place, &#383;aue here in Italy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Ca&#383;&#383;i.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know where I will weare this Dagger then;</LINE>
<LINE>Ca&#383;&#383;ius from Bondage will deliuer Ca&#383;&#383;ius:</LINE>
<LINE>Therein, yee Gods, you make the weake mo&#8217;t &#383;trong;</LINE>
<LINE>Therein, yee Gods, you Tyrants doe defeat.</LINE>
<LINE>Nor Stonie Tower, nor Walls of beaten Bra&#383;&#383;e,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor ayre-le&#383;&#383;e Dungeon, nor &#383;trong Linkes of Iron,</LINE>
<LINE>Can be retentiue to the &#383;trength of &#383;pirit:</LINE>
<LINE>But Life being wearie of these worldly Barres,</LINE>
<LINE>Neuer lacks power to dismi&#383;&#383;e it &#383;elfe.</LINE>
<LINE>If I know this, know all the World besides,</LINE>
<LINE>That part of Tyrannie that I doe beare,</LINE>
<LINE>I can &#383;hake off at pleasure.</LINE>
</SPEECH>
<STAGEDIR>Thunder &#383;till.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Cask.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So can I:</LINE>
<LINE>So euery Bond-man in his owne hand beares</LINE>
<LINE>The power to cancell his Captiuitie.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Ca&#383;&#383;i.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And why &#383;hould Caesar be a Tyrant then?</LINE>
<LINE>Poore man, I know he would not be a Wolfe,</LINE>
<LINE>But that he &#383;ees the Romans are but Sheepe:</LINE>
<LINE>He were no Lyon, were not Romans Hindes.</LINE>
<LINE>Those that with haste will make a mightie fire,</LINE>
<LINE>Begin it with weake Strawes. What trash is Rome?</LINE>
<LINE>What Rubbish, and what Offall? when it &#383;erues</LINE>
<LINE>For the base matter, to illuminate</LINE>
<LINE>So vile a thing as Caesar. But oh Griefe,</LINE>
<LINE>Where hast thou led me? I (perhaps) &#383;peake this</LINE>
<LINE>Before a willing Bond-man: then I know</LINE>
<LINE>My answere must be made. But I am arm&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>And dangers are to me indifferent.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>Brut.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It must be by his death: and for my part,</LINE>
<LINE>I know no personall cause, to &#383;purne at him,</LINE>
<LINE>But for the generall. He would be crown&#8217;d:</LINE>
<LINE>How that might change his nature, there's the question?</LINE>
<LINE>It is the bright day, that brings forth the Adder,</LINE>
<LINE>And that craues warie walking: Crowne him that,</LINE>
<LINE>And then I graunt we put a Sting in him,</LINE>
<LINE>That at his will he may doe danger with.</LINE>
<LINE>Th&#8217; abuse of Greatne&#383;&#383;e, is, when it dis-ioynes</LINE>
<LINE>Remorse from Power: And to &#383;peake truth of Caesar,</LINE>
<LINE>I haue not knowne, when his Affections &#383;way&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>More then his Reason. But &#8216;tis a common proofe,</LINE>
<LINE>That Lowlyne&#383;&#383;e is young Ambitions Ladder,</LINE>
<LINE>Whereto the Climber vpward turnes his Face:</LINE>
<LINE>But when he once attaines the vpmost Round,</LINE>
<LINE>He then vnto the Ladder turnes his Backe,</LINE>
<LINE>Lookes in the Clouds, &#383;corning the base degrees</LINE>
<LINE>By which he did ascend: &#383;o Caesar may;</LINE>
<LINE>Then least he may, preuent. And &#383;ince the Quarrell</LINE>
<LINE>Will beare no colour, for the thing he is,</LINE>
<LINE>Fashion it thus; that what he is, augmented,</LINE>
<LINE>Would runne to these, and these extremities:</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore thinke him as a Serpents egge,</LINE>
<LINE>Which hatch&#8217;d, would as his kinde grow mischieuous;</LINE>
<LINE>And kill him in the &#383;hell.</LINE>

<LINE>Decius well vrg&#8217;d: I thinke it is not meet,</LINE>
<LINE>Marke Antony, &#383;o well belou&#8217;d of Caesar,</LINE>
<LINE>Should out-liue Caesar, we &#383;hall finde of him</LINE>
<LINE>A &#383;hrew&#8217;d Contriuer. And you know, his meanes</LINE>
<LINE>If he improue them, may well &#383;tretch &#383;o farre</LINE>
<LINE>As to annoy vs all: which to preuent,</LINE>
<LINE>Let Antony and Caesar fall together.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Bru.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Our course will &#383;eeme too bloody, Caius Ca&#383;&#383;ius,</LINE>
<LINE>To cut the Head off, and then hacke the Limbes:</LINE>
<LINE>Like Wrath in death, and Enuy afterwards:</LINE>
<LINE>For Antony, is but a Limbe of Caesar.</LINE>
<LINE>Let's be Sacrificers, but not Butchers Caius:</LINE>
<LINE>We all &#383;tand vp against the &#383;pirit of Caesar,</LINE>
<LINE>And in the Spirit of men, there is no blood:</LINE>
<LINE>O that we then could come by Caesars Spirit,</LINE>
<LINE>And not dismember Caesar! But (alas)</LINE>
<LINE>Caesar must bleed for it. And gentle Friends,</LINE>
<LINE>Let's kill him Boldly, but not Wrathfully:</LINE>
<LINE>Let's carue him, as a Dish fit for the Gods,</LINE>
<LINE>Not hew him as a Carka&#383;&#383;e fit for Hounds:</LINE>
<LINE>And let our Hearts, as &#383;ubtle Masters do,</LINE>
<LINE>Stirre vp their Seruants to an acte of Rage,</LINE>
<LINE>And after &#383;eeme to chide 'em. This &#383;hall make</LINE>
<LINE>Our purpose Nece&#383;&#383;ary, and not Enuious.</LINE>
<LINE>Which &#383;o appearing to the common eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>We &#383;hall be call&#8217;d Purgers, not Murderers.</LINE>
<LINE>And for Marke Antony, thinke not of him:</LINE>
<LINE>For he can do no more then Caesars Arme,</LINE>
<LINE>When Caesars head is off.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Cas.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yet I feare him,</LINE>
<LINE>For in the ingrafted loue he beares to Caesar.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Bru.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alas, good Ca&#383;&#383;ius, do not thinke of him:</LINE>
<LINE>If he loue Caesar, all that he can do</LINE>
<LINE>Is to himselfe; take thought, and dye for Caesar,</LINE>
<LINE>And that were much he &#383;hould: for he is giuen</LINE>
<LINE>To &#383;ports, to wildene&#383;&#383;e, and much company.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Ca&#383;&#383;.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But it is doubtfull yet,</LINE>
<LINE>Whether Caesar will come forth to day, or no:</LINE>
<LINE>For he is Superstitious growne of late,</LINE>
<LINE>Quite from the maine Opinion he held once,</LINE>
<LINE>Of Fantasie, of Dreames, and Ceremonies:</LINE>
<LINE>It may be, these apparant Prodigies,</LINE>
<LINE>The vnaccustom&#8217;d Terror of this night,</LINE>
<LINE>And the perswasion of his Augurers,</LINE>
<LINE>May hold him from the Capitoll to day.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Decius.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Neuer feare that: If he be &#383;o resolu&#8217;d,</LINE>

<LINE>And Beares with Gla&#383;&#383;es, Elephants with Holes,</LINE>
<LINE>Lyons with Toyles, and men with Flatterers.</LINE>
<LINE>But, when I tell him, he hates Flatterers,</LINE>
<LINE>He &#383;ayes, he does; being then mo&#8217;t flattered.</LINE>
<LINE>Let me worke:</LINE>
<LINE>For I can giue his humour the true bent;</LINE>
<LINE>And I will bring him to the Capitoll.</LINE>

<LINE>If then thy Spirit looke vpon vs now,</LINE>
<LINE>Shall it not greeue thee deerer then thy death,</LINE>
<LINE>To &#383;ee thy Antony making his peace,</LINE>
<LINE>Shaking the bloody fingers of thy F&#339;s?</LINE>
<LINE>Mo&#8217;t Noble, in the presence of thy Coarse,</LINE>
<LINE>Had I as many eyes, as thou hast wounds,</LINE>
<LINE>Weeping as fast as they &#383;treame forth thy blood,</LINE>
<LINE>It would become me better, then to close</LINE>
<LINE>In tearmes of Friendship with thine enemies.</LINE>
<LINE>Pardon me Iulius, heere was't thou bay&#8217;d braue Hart,</LINE>
<LINE>Heere did'st thou fall, and heere thy Hunters &#383;tand</LINE>

Beleeue me for mine Honor, and haue respect to mine Honor, that you may beleeue. Censure me in your Wisedom, and awake your Senses, that you may the better Iudge. If there bee any in this A&#383;&#383;embly, any deere Friend of Caesars, to him I &#383;ay, that Brutus loue to Caesar, was no le&#383;&#383;e then his. If then, that Friend demand, why Brutus rose against Cae-sar, this is my an&#383;wer: Not that I lou&#8217;d Caesar le&#383;&#383;e, but that I lou&#8217;d Rome more. Had you rather Caesar were li-uing, and dye all Slaues; then that Caesar were dead, to liue all Free-men? As Caesar lou&#8217;d mee, I weepe for him; as he was Fortunate, I reioyce at it; as he was Valiant, I honour him: But, as he was Ambitious, I &#383;lew him. There is Teares, for his Loue: Ioy, for his Fortune: Honor, for his Valour: and Death, for his Ambition. Who is heere &#383;o base, that would be a Bondman? If any, &#383;peak, for him haue I offended. Who is heere &#383;o rude, that would not be a Roman? If any, &#383;peak, for him haue I offended. Who is heere &#383;o vile, that will not loue his Countrey? If any, &#383;peake, for him haue I offended. I pause for a Reply.</LINE>

<LINE>I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him:</LINE>
<LINE>The euill that men do, liues after them,</LINE>
<LINE>The good is oft enterred with their bones,</LINE>
<LINE>So let it be with Caesar. The Noble Brutus,</LINE>
<LINE>Hath told you Caesar was Ambitious:</LINE>
<LINE>If it were &#383;o, it was a greeuous Fault,</LINE>
<LINE>And greeuously hath Caesar an&#383;wer&#8217;d it.</LINE>
<LINE>Heere, vnder leaue of Brutus, and the rest</LINE>
<LINE>(For Brutus is an Honourable man,</LINE>
<LINE>So are they all; all Honourable men)</LINE>
<LINE>Come I to &#383;peake in Caesars Funerall.</LINE>
<LINE>He was my Friend, faithfull, and iust to me;</LINE>
<LINE>But Brutus &#383;ayes, he was Ambitious,</LINE>
<LINE>And Brutus is an Honourable man.</LINE>
<LINE>He hath brought many Captiues home to Rome,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose Ransomes, did the generall Coffers fill:</LINE>
<LINE>Did this in Caesar &#383;eeme Ambitious?</LINE>
<LINE>When that the poore haue cry&#8217;de, Caesar hath wept:</LINE>
<LINE>Ambition &#383;hould be made of &#383;terner &#383;tuffe,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet Brutus &#383;ayes, he was Ambitious:</LINE>
<LINE>And Brutus is an Honourable man.</LINE>
<LINE>You all did &#383;ee, that on the Lupercall,</LINE>
<LINE>I thrice presented him a Kingly Crowne,</LINE>
<LINE>Which he did thrice refuse. Was this Ambition?</LINE>
<LINE>Yet Brutus &#383;ayes, he was Ambitious:</LINE>
<LINE>And &#383;ure he is an Honourable man.</LINE>
<LINE>I &#383;peake not to disprooue what Brutus &#383;poke,</LINE>
<LINE>But heere I am, to &#383;peake what I do know;</LINE>
<LINE>You all did loue him once, not without cause,</LINE>
<LINE>What cause with-holds you then, to mourne for him?</LINE>
<LINE>O Iudgement! thou are fled to brutish Beasts,</LINE>
<LINE>And Men haue lost their Reason. Beare with me,</LINE>
<LINE>My heart is in the Coffin there with Caesar,</LINE>
