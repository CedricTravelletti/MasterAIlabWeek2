<LINE>Now faire Hippolita, our nuptiall houre</LINE>
<LINE>Drawes on apace: foure happy daies bring in</LINE>
<LINE>Another Moon: but oh, me thinkes, how &#383;low</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>The.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go Philostrate, Stirre vp the Athenian youth to merriments, Awake the pert and nimble &#383;pirit of mirth, Turne melancholy forth to Funerals: The pale companion is not for our pompe, Hippolita, I woo&#8217;d thee with my &#383;word, And wonne thy loue, doing thee iniuries: But I will wed thee in another key, With pompe, with triumph, and with reuelling.</LINE>

<LINE>And interchang&#8217;d loue-tokens with my childe:</LINE>
<LINE>Thou hast by Moone-light at her window &#383;ung,</LINE>
<LINE>With faining voice, verses of faining loue,</LINE>
<LINE>And &#383;tolne the impre&#383;&#383;ion of her fantasie,</LINE>
<LINE>With bracelets of thy haire, rings, gawdes, conceits,</LINE>
<LINE>Knackes, trifles, Nose-gaies, &#383;weet meats (me&#383;&#383;engers</LINE>
<LINE>Of &#383;trong preuailment in vnhardned youth)</LINE>
<LINE>With cunning hast thou filch&#8217;d my daughters heart,</LINE>
<LINE>Turn&#8217;d her obedience (which is due to me)</LINE>
<LINE>To &#383;tubborne harshne&#383;&#383;e. And my gracious Duke,</LINE>
<LINE>Be it &#383;o &#383;he will not heere before your Grace,</LINE>
<LINE>Consent to marrie with Demetrius,</LINE>
<LINE>I beg the ancient priuiledge of Athens;</LINE>
<LINE>As &#383;he is mine, I may dispose of her;</LINE>
<LINE>Which &#383;hall be either to this Gentleman,</LINE>
<LINE>Or to her death, according to our Law,</LINE>
<LINE>Immediately prouided in that case.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>The.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What &#383;ay you Hermia? be aduis&#8217;d faire Maide,</LINE>
<LINE>To you your Father &#383;hould be as a God;</LINE>
<LINE>One that compos&#8217;d your beauties; yea and one</LINE>
<LINE>To whom you are but as a forme in waxe</LINE>
<LINE>By him imprinted: and within his power,</LINE>
<LINE>To leaue the figure, or disfigure it:</LINE>
<LINE>Demetrius is a worthy Gentleman.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Her.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So is Lysander.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>The.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">In himselfe he is.</LINE>
<LINE>But in this kinde, wanting your fathers voyce,</LINE>
<LINE>The other must be held the worthier.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Her.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would my father look&#8217;d but with my eyes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>The.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Rather your eies must with his iudgment looke.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Her.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do entreat your Grace to pardon me.</LINE>
<LINE>I know not by what power I am made bold,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor how it may concerne my modestie</LINE>
<LINE>In &#383;uch a presence heere to pleade my thoughts:</LINE>
<LINE>But I beseech your Grace, that I may know</LINE>
<LINE>The worst that may befall me in this case,</LINE>
<LINE>If I refuse to wed Demetrius.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>The.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Either to dye the death, or to abiure</LINE>
<LINE>For euer the &#383;ociety of men.</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore faire Hermia question your desires,</LINE>
<LINE>Know of your youth, examine well your blood,</LINE>
<LINE>Whether (if you yeeld not to your fathers choice)</LINE>
<LINE>You can endure the liuerie of a Nunne,</LINE>
<LINE>For aye to be in &#383;hady Cloister mew&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>To liue a barren &#383;ister all your life,</LINE>
<LINE>Chanting faint hymnes to the cold fruitle&#383;&#383;e Moone,</LINE>
<LINE>Thrice ble&#383;&#383;ed they that master &#383;o their blood,</LINE>
<LINE>To vndergo &#383;uch maiden pilgrimage,</LINE>
<LINE>But earthlier happie is the Rose distil&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Then that which withering on the virgin thorne,</LINE>
<LINE>Growes, liues, and dies, in &#383;ingle ble&#383;&#383;edne&#383;&#383;e.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Her.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So will I grow, &#383;o liue, &#383;o die my Lord,</LINE>
<LINE>Ere I will yeeld my virgin Patent vp</LINE>
<LINE>Vnto his Lordship, whose vnwished yoake,</LINE>
<LINE>My &#383;oule consents not to giue &#383;oueraignty.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>The.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Take time to pause, and by the next new Moon</LINE>
<LINE>The &#383;ealing day betwixt my loue and me,</LINE>
<LINE>For euerlasting bond of fellowship:</LINE>
<LINE>Vpon that day either prepare to dye,</LINE>
<LINE>For disobedience to your fathers will,</LINE>
<LINE>Or else to wed Demetrius as hee would,</LINE>
<LINE>Or on Dianaes Altar to protest</LINE>
<LINE>For aie, austerity, and &#383;ingle life.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Dem.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Relent &#383;weet Hermia, and Lysander, yeelde</LINE>

<LINE>You haue her fathers loue, Demetrius:</LINE>
<LINE>Let me haue Hermiaes: do you marry him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Scornfull Lysander, true, he hath my Loue;</LINE>
<LINE>And what is mine, my loue &#383;hall render him.</LINE>
<LINE>And &#383;he is mine, and all my right of her,</LINE>
<LINE>I do estate vnto Demetrius.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Lys.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am my Lord, as well deriu&#8217;d as he,</LINE>
<LINE>As well po&#383;&#383;est: my loue is more then his:</LINE>
<LINE>My fortunes euery way as fairely ranck&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>(If not with vantage) as Demetrius:</LINE>
<LINE>And (which is more then all these boasts can be)</LINE>
<LINE>I am belou&#8217;d of beauteous Hermia.</LINE>
<LINE>Why &#383;hould not I then prosecute my right?</LINE>
<LINE>Demetrius, Ile auouch it to his head,</LINE>
<LINE>Made loue to Nedars daughter, Helena,</LINE>
<LINE>And won her &#383;oule: and &#383;he (sweet Ladie) dotes,</LINE>
<LINE>Deuoutly dotes, dotes in Idolatry,</LINE>
<LINE>Vpon this &#383;potted and inconstant man.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>The.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I must confe&#383;&#383;e, that I haue heard &#383;o much,</LINE>
<LINE>And with Demetrius thought to haue &#383;poke thereof:</LINE>
<LINE>But being ouer-full of &#383;elfe-affaires,</LINE>
<LINE>My minde did lose it. But Demetrius come,</LINE>
<LINE>And come Egeus, you &#383;hall go with me,</LINE>
<LINE>I haue &#383;ome priuate &#383;chooling for you both.</LINE>
<LINE>For you faire Hermia, looke you arme your &#383;elfe,</LINE>
<LINE>To fit your fancies to your Fathers will;</LINE>
<LINE>Or else the Law of Athens yeelds you vp</LINE>
<LINE>(Which by no meanes we may extenuate)</LINE>
<LINE>To death, or to a vow of &#383;ingle life.</LINE>
<LINE>Come my Hippolita, what cheare my loue?</LINE>
<LINE>Demetrius and Egeus go along:</LINE>
<LINE>I must imploy you in &#383;ome busine&#383;&#383;e</LINE>

<LINE>How chance the Roses there do fade &#383;o fast?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Her.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Belike for want of raine, which I could well</LINE>
<LINE>Beteeme them, from the tempest of mine eyes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Lys.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For ought that euer I could reade,</LINE>
<LINE>Could euer heare by tale or historie,</LINE>
<LINE>The course of true loue neuer did run &#383;mooth,</LINE>

<LINE>Making it momentarie, as a &#383;ound:</LINE>
<LINE>Swift as a &#383;hadow, &#383;hort as any dreame,</LINE>
<LINE>Briefe as the lightning in the collied night,</LINE>
<LINE>That (in a &#383;pleene) vnfolds both heauen and earth;</LINE>
<LINE>And ere a man hath power to &#383;ay, behold,</LINE>
<LINE>The iawes of darkne&#383;&#383; do deuoure it vp:</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<LINE>And in the wood, a league without the towne,</LINE>
<LINE>(Where I did meete thee once with Helena.</LINE>
<LINE>To do obseruance for a morne of May)</LINE>
<LINE>There will I &#383;tay for thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>(A time that Louers flights doth &#383;till conceale)</LINE>
<LINE>Through Athens gates, haue we deuis&#8217;d to &#383;teale.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Her.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And in the wood, where often you and I,</LINE>
<LINE>Vpon faint Primrose beds, were wont to lye,</LINE>
<LINE>Emptying our bosomes, of their counsell &#383;weld:</LINE>
<LINE>There my Lysander, and my &#383;elfe &#383;hall meete,</LINE>
<LINE>And thence from Athens turne away our eyes</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Lys.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will my Hermia. Helena adieu,</LINE>
<LINE>As you on him, Demetrius dotes on you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit Lysander.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Hele.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How happy &#383;ome, ore othersome can be?</LINE>
<LINE>Through Athens I am thought as faire as &#383;he.</LINE>
<LINE>But what of that? Demetrius thinkes not &#383;o:</LINE>
<LINE>He will not know, what all, but he doth know,</LINE>
<LINE>And as hee erres, doting on Hermias eyes;</LINE>
<LINE>So I, admiring of his qualities:</LINE>
<LINE>Things base and vilde, holding no quantity,</LINE>
<LINE>Loue can transpose to forme and dignity,</LINE>
<LINE>Loue lookes not with the eyes, but with the minde,</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore is wing&#8217;d Cupid painted blinde.</LINE>
<LINE>Nor hath loues minde of any iudgement taste:</LINE>
<LINE>Wings and no eyes, figure, vnheedy haste.</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore is Loue &#383;aid to be a childe,</LINE>
<LINE>Because in choise he is often beguil&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>As waggish boyes in game themselues forsweare;</LINE>
<LINE>So the boy Loue is periur&#8217;d euery where.</LINE>
<LINE>For ere Demetrius lookt on Hermias eyne,</LINE>
<LINE>He hail&#8217;d downe oathes that he was onely mine.</LINE>
<LINE>And when this Haile &#383;ome heat from Hermia felt,</LINE>
<LINE>So he di&#383;&#383;olu&#8217;d, and &#383;howres of oathes did melt,</LINE>
<LINE>I will goe tell him of faire Hermias flight:</LINE>
<LINE>Then to the wood will he, to morrow night</LINE>
<LINE>Pursue her; and for his intelligence,</LINE>
<LINE>If I haue thankes, it is a deere expence:</LINE>
<LINE>But heerein meane I to enrich my paine,</LINE>
<LINE>To haue his &#383;ight thither, and backe againe.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit.</STAGEDIR>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Quince the Carpenter, Snug the Ioyner, Bottome the Weauer, Flute the bellowes-mender, Snout the Tinker, and Starueling the Taylor</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Quin.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is all our company heere?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Bot.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You were best to call them generally, man by man according to the &#383;crip.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Qui.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here is the &#383;crowle of euery mans name, which is thought fit through all Athens, to play in our Enter-lude before the Duke and the Dutches, on his wedding day at night.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Bot.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>First, good Peter Quince, &#383;ay what the play treats on: then read the names of the Actors: and &#383;o grow on to a point.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Quin.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry our play is the mo&#8217;t lamentable come-dy, and mo&#8217;t cruell death of Pyramus and Thisbie.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Bot.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A very good peece of worke I a&#383;&#383;ure you, and a merry. Now good Peter Quince, call forth your Actors by the &#383;crowle. Masters &#383;pread your &#383;elues.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Quince.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Answere as I call you. Nick Bottome the</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Quince.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You Nicke Bottome are &#383;et downe for Py-ramus.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Bot.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What is Pyramus, a louer, or a tyrant?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Quin.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A Louer that kills himselfe mo&#8217;t gallantly for loue.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Bot.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That will aske &#383;ome teares in the true perfor-ming of it: if I do it, let the audience looke to their eies: I will mooue &#383;tormes; I will condole in &#383;ome measure. To the rest yet, my chiefe humour is for a tyrant. I could play Ercles rarely, or a part to teare a Cat in, to make all &#383;plit the raging Rocks; and &#383;hiuering &#383;hocks &#383;hall break the locks of prison gates, and Phibbus carre &#383;hall &#383;hine from farre, and make and marre the foolish Fates. This was lofty. Now name the rest of the Players. This is Ercles vaine, a tyrants vaine: a louer is more condo-ling. _</LINE>

<LINE>Nay faith, let not mee play a woman, I haue a beard comming.</LINE>

<LINE>And in the &#383;hape of Corin, &#383;ate all day,</LINE>
<LINE>Playing on pipes of Corne, and versing loue</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Que.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>These are the forgeries of iealousie,</LINE>
<LINE>And neuer &#383;ince the middle Summers &#383;pring</LINE>
<LINE>Met we on hil, in dale, forrest, or mead,</LINE>
<LINE>By paued fountaine, or by rushie brooke,</LINE>
<LINE>Or in the beached margent of the &#383;ea,</LINE>
<LINE>To dance our ringlets to the whistling Winde,</LINE>
<LINE>But with thy braules thou hast disturb&#8217;d our &#383;port.</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore the Windes, piping to vs in vaine,</LINE>
<LINE>As in reuenge, haue &#383;uck&#8217;d vp from the &#383;ea</LINE>
<LINE>Contagious fogges: Which falling in the Land,</LINE>
<LINE>Hath euerie petty Riuer made &#383;o proud,</LINE>
<LINE>That they haue ouer-borne their Continents.</LINE>
<LINE>The Oxe hath therefore &#383;tretch&#8217;d his yoake in vaine,</LINE>
<LINE>The Ploughman lost his &#383;weat, and the greene Corne</LINE>
<LINE>Hath rotted, ere his youth attain&#8217;d a beard:</LINE>
<LINE>The fold &#383;tands empty in the drowned field,</LINE>
<LINE>And Crowes are fatted with the murrion flocke,</LINE>
<LINE>The nine mens Morris is fild vp with mud,</LINE>
<LINE>And the queint Mazes in the wanton greene,</LINE>
<LINE>For lacke of tread are vndistinguishable.</LINE>
<LINE>The humane mortals want their winter heere,</LINE>
<LINE>No night is now with hymne or caroll blest;</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore the Moone (the gouerne&#383;&#383;e of floods)</LINE>
<LINE>Pale in her anger, washes all the aire;</LINE>
<LINE>That Rheumaticke diseases doe abound.</LINE>
<LINE>And through this distemperature, we &#383;ee</LINE>
<LINE>The &#383;easons alter; hoared headed Frosts</LINE>
<LINE>Fall in the fresh lap of the crimson Rose,</LINE>
<LINE>And on old Hyems chinne and Icie crowne,</LINE>
<LINE>An odorous Chaplet of &#383;weet Sommer buds</LINE>
<LINE>Is as in mockry &#383;et. The Spring, the Sommer,</LINE>
<LINE>The childing Autumne, angry Winter change</LINE>
<LINE>Their wonted Liueries, and the mazed world,</LINE>
<LINE>By their increase, now knowes not which is which;</LINE>
<LINE>And this &#383;ame progeny of euills,</LINE>
<LINE>Comes from our debate, from our di&#383;&#383;ention,</LINE>
<LINE>We are their parents and originall.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Do you amend it then, it lies in you,</LINE>

<LINE>Following (her wombe then rich with my yong &#383;quire)</LINE>
<LINE>Would imitate, and &#383;aile vpon the Land,</LINE>
<LINE>To fetch me trifles, and returne againe,</LINE>
<LINE>As from a voyage, rich with merchandize.</LINE>
<LINE>But &#383;he being mortall, of that boy did die,</LINE>

If you thinke I come hither as a Lyon, it were pitty of my life. No, I am no &#383;uch thing, I am a man as other men are; and there indeed let him name his name, and tell him plainly hee is Snug the ioyner.</LINE>

Stolne hence, and left me asleepe: I haue had a mo&#8217;t rare vision. I had a dreame, past the wit of man, to &#383;ay, what dreame it was. Man is but an A&#383;&#383;e, if he goe about to expound this dreame. Me-thought I was, there is no man can tell what. Me-thought I was, and me-thought I had. But man is but a patch&#8217;d foole, if he will offer to &#383;ay, what me-thought I had. The eye of man hath not heard, the eare of man hath not &#383;een, mans hand is not able to taste, his tongue to conceiue, nor his heart to report, what my dreame was. I will get Peter Quince to write a ballet of this dreame, it &#383;hall be called Bottomes Dreame, because it hath no bottome; and I will &#383;ing it in the latter end of a play, before the Duke. Per-aduenture, to make it the more gracious, I &#383;hall &#383;ing it at her death. <STAGEDIR>Exit.</STAGEDIR></LINE>
