It greeues me to &#383;ee &#383;o many dip there meate in one mans blood, and all the madne&#383;&#383;e is, he cheeres them vp too. I wonder men dare trust themselues with men. Me thinks they &#383;hould enuite them without kniues, Good for there meate, and &#383;afer for their liues. There's much example for't, the fellow that &#383;its next him, now parts bread with him, pledges the breath of him in a diuided draught: is the readiest man to kill him. 'Tas beene proued, if I were a huge man I &#383;hould feare to drinke at meales, least they &#383;hould &#383;pie my wind-pipes dangerous noates, great men &#383;hould drinke with harne&#383;&#383;e on their throates.</LINE>

<LINE>Flow this way? A braue fellow. He keepes his tides well, those healths will make thee and thy &#383;tate looke ill, Timon. Heere's that which is too weake to be a &#383;inner, Honest water, which nere left man i'th&#8217; mire: This and my food are equals, there's no ods, Feasts are to proud to giue thanks to the Gods. <STAGEDIR>Apermantus Grace.</STAGEDIR> Immortall Gods, I craue no pelfe, I pray for no man but my &#383;elfe, Graunt I may neuer proue &#383;o fond, To trust man on his Oath or Bond. Or a Harlot for her weeping, Or a Dogge that &#383;eemes asleeping, Or a keeper with my freedome, Or my friends if I &#383;hould need 'em. Amen. So fall too't: Richmen &#383;in, and I eat root. Much good dich thy good heart, Apermantus</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Timon.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Oh no doubt my good Friends, but the Gods themselues haue prouided that I &#383;hall haue much helpe from you: how had you beene my Friends else. Why haue you that charitable title from thousands? Did not you chiefely belong to my heart? I haue told more of you to my &#383;elfe, then you can with modestie &#383;peake in your owne behalfe. And thus farre I confirme you. Oh you Gods (thinke I,) what need we haue any Friends; if we &#383;hould nere haue need of 'em? They were the mo&#8217;t needle&#383;&#383;e Creatures liuing; &#383;hould we nere haue vse for 'em? And would mo&#8217;t resemble &#383;weete Instruments hung vp in Cases, that keepes there &#383;ounds to them-selues. Why I haue often wisht my &#383;elfe poorer, that I might come neerer to you: we are borne to do bene-fits. And what better or properer can we call our owne, then the riches of our Friends? Oh what a pretious com-fort &#8216;tis, to haue &#383;o many like Brothers commanding one anothers Fortunes. Oh ioyes, e'ne made away er't can be borne: mine eies cannot hold out water me thinks to forget their Faults. I drinke to you.</LINE>

How vnluckily it hapned, that I &#383;hold Purchase the day before for a little part, and vndo a great deale of Honour? Seruilius, now before the Gods I am not able to do (the more beast I &#383;ay) I was &#383;ending to vse Lord Timon my &#383;elfe, these Gentlemen can witne&#383;&#383;e; but I would not for the wealth of Athens I had done't now. Commend me bountifully to his good Lordship, and I hope his Honor will conceiue the fairest of mee, because I haue no power to be kinde. And tell him this from me, I count it one of my greatest afflictions &#383;ay, that I cannot pleasure &#383;uch an Honourable Gentleman.

<LINE>That dips in the &#383;ame dish? For in my knowing</LINE>
<LINE>Timon has bin this Lords Father,</LINE>
<LINE>And kept his credit with his purse:</LINE>
<LINE>Supported his estate, nay Timons money</LINE>
<LINE>Has paid his men their wages. He ne're drinkes,</LINE>

<LINE>And yet, oh &#383;ee the monstrousne&#383;&#383;e of man,</LINE>
<LINE>When he lookes out in an vngratefull &#383;hape;</LINE>

<LINE>And does he &#383;end to me? Three? Humh?</LINE>
<LINE>It &#383;hewes but little loue, or iudgement in him.</LINE>
<LINE>Must I be his last Refuge? His Friends (like Physitians)</LINE>
<LINE>Thriue, giue him ouer: Must I take th&#8217; Cure vpon me?</LINE>
<LINE>Has much disgrac&#8217;d me in't, I'me angry at him,</LINE>
<LINE>That might haue knowne my place. I &#383;ee no &#383;ense for't,</LINE>
<LINE>But his Occasions might haue wo&#339;d me first:</LINE>
<LINE>For in my conscience, I was the first man</LINE>
<LINE>That ere receiued guift from him.</LINE>
<LINE>And does he thinke &#383;o backwardly of me now,</LINE>
<LINE>That Ile requite it last? No:</LINE>
<LINE>So it may proue an Argument of Laughter</LINE>
<LINE>To th&#8217; rest, and 'mong'st Lords be thought a Foole:</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;de rather then the worth of thrice the &#383;umme,</LINE>
<LINE>Had &#383;ent to me first, but for my mindes &#383;ake:</LINE>

How fairely this Lord &#383;triues to appeare foule? Takes Vertu-ous Copies to be wicked: like those, that vnder hotte ar-dent zeale, would &#383;et whole Realmes on fire, of &#383;uch a na-ture is his politike loue. This was my Lords best hope, now all are fled Saue onely the Gods. Now his Friends are dead, Doores that were ne're acquainted with their Wards Many a bounteous yeere, must be imploy&#8217;d Now to guard &#383;ure their Master: And this is all a liberall course allowes, Who cannot keepe his wealth, must keep his house. <STAGEDIR>Exit.</STAGEDIR> </LINE>

<LINE>I am an humble Sutor to your Vertues;</LINE>
<LINE>For pitty is the vertue of the Law,</LINE>

<LINE>It pleases time and Fortune to lye heauie</LINE>
<LINE>Vpon a Friend of mine, who in hot blood</LINE>
<LINE>Hath &#383;tept into the Law: which is past depth</LINE>
<LINE>To those that (without heede) do plundge intoo't.</LINE>
<LINE>He is a Man (setting his Fate aside) of comely Vertues,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor did he &#383;oyle the fact with Cowardice.</LINE>
<LINE>(And Honour in him, which buyes out his fault)</LINE>
<LINE>But with a Noble Fury, and faire &#383;pirit,</LINE>
<LINE>Seeing his Reputation touch&#8217;d to death,</LINE>
<LINE>He did oppose his F&#339;:</LINE>
<LINE>And with &#383;uch &#383;ober and vnnoted pa&#383;&#383;ion</LINE>
<LINE>He did behooue his anger ere 'twas &#383;pent,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1.Sen.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You vndergo too &#383;trict a Paradox,</LINE>

<LINE>To bring Man-slaughter into forme, and &#383;et Quarrelling</LINE>
<LINE>Vpon the head of Valour; which indeede</LINE>
<LINE>Is Valour mis-begot, and came into the world,</LINE>
<LINE>When Sects, and Factions were newly borne.</LINE>
<LINE>Hee's truly Valiant, that can wisely &#383;uffer</LINE>
<LINE>The worst that man can breath,</LINE>
<LINE>And make his Wrongs, his Out-sides,</LINE>
<LINE>To weare them like his Rayment, carele&#383;&#383;ely,</LINE>
<LINE>And ne're preferre his iniuries to his heart,</LINE>
<LINE>To bring it into danger.</LINE>

<LINE>My Lords, then vnder fauour, pardon me,</LINE>
<LINE>If I &#383;peake like a Captaine.</LINE>
<LINE>Why do fond men expose themselues to Battell,</LINE>
<LINE>And not endure all threats? Sleepe vpon't,</LINE>
<LINE>And let the F&#339;s quietly cut their Throats</LINE>
<LINE>Without repugnancy? If there be</LINE>
<LINE>Such Valour in the bearing, what make wee</LINE>
<LINE>Abroad? Why then, Women are more valiant</LINE>
<LINE>That &#383;tay at home, if Bearing carry it:</LINE>
<LINE>And the A&#383;&#383;e, more Captaine then the Lyon?</LINE>
<LINE>The fellow loaden with Irons, wiser then the Iudge?</LINE>
<LINE>If Wisedome be in &#383;uffering. Oh my Lords,</LINE>
<LINE>As you are great, be pittifully Good,</LINE>
<LINE>Who cannot condemne rashne&#383;&#383;e in cold blood?</LINE>
<LINE>To kill, I grant, is &#383;innes extreamest Gust,</LINE>
<LINE>But in defence, by Mercy, &#8216;tis mo&#8217;t iust.</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He has made too much plenty with him:</LINE>

<LINE>That often drownes him, and takes his valour prisoner.</LINE>
<LINE>If there were no F&#339;s, that were enough</LINE>

For were your Godheads to borrow of men, men would forsake the Gods. Make the Meate be beloued, more then the Man that giues it. Let no A&#383;&#383;embly of Twenty, be without a &#383;core of Villaines. If there &#383;it twelue Women at the Table, let a dozen of them bee as they are. The rest of your Fees, O Gods, the Senators of Athens, together with the common legge of People, what is ami&#383;&#383;e in them, you Gods, make &#383;uteable for destruction. For these my present Friends, as they are to mee nothing, &#383;o in nothing ble&#383;&#383;e them, and to nothing are they welcome. Vncouer Dogges, and lap. Some &#383;peake.

If thou wert the Wolfe, thy greedine&#383;&#383;e would afflict thee, &amp; oft thou &#383;hould'st hazard thy life for thy dinner. Wert thou the Vnicorne, pride and wrath would confound thee, and make thine owne &#383;elfe the conquest of thy fury. Wert thou a Beare, thou would'st be kill&#8217;d by the Horse: wert thou a Horse, thou would'st be &#383;eaz&#8217;d by the Leo-pard: wert thou a Leopard, thou wert Germane to the Lion, and the &#383;pottes of thy Kindred, were Iurors on thy life.
