<line>Open your Eares: For which of you will &#383;top</line>
<line>The vent of Hearing, when loud Rumor &#383;peakes?</line>
<line>I, from the Orient, to the drooping West</line>
<line>(Making the winde my Post-horse) &#383;till vnfold</line>
<line>The Acts commenced on this Ball of Earth.</line>
<line>Vpon my Tongue, continuall Slanders ride,</line>
<line>The which, in euery Language, I pronounce,</line>
<line>Stuffing the Eares of them with false Reports:</line>
<line>I &#383;peake of Peace, while couert Enmitie</line>
<line>(Vnder the &#383;mile of Safety) wounds the World:</line>
<line>And who but Rumour, who but onely I</line>
<line>Make fearfull Musters, and prepar&#8217;d Defence,</line>
<line>Whil'st the bigge yeare, &#383;wolne with &#383;ome other griefes,</line>
<line>Is thought with childe, by the &#383;terne Tyrant, Warre,</line>
<line>And no &#383;uch matter? Rumour, is a Pipe</line>
<line>Blowne by Surmises, Ielousies, Coniectures;</line>
<line>And of &#383;o easie, and &#383;o plaine a &#383;top,</line>
<line>That the blunt Monster, with vncounted heads,</line>
<line>The &#383;till discordant, wauering Multitude,</line>
<line>Can play vpon it. But what neede I thus</line>
<line>My well-knowne Body to Anathomize</line>
<line>Among my houshold? Why is Rumour heere?</line>
<line>I run before King Harries victory,</line>
<line>Who in a bloodie field by Shrewsburie</line>
<line>Hath beaten downe yong Hotspurre, and his Troopes,</line>
<line>Quenching the flame of bold Rebellion,</line>
<line>Euen with the Rebels blood. But what meane I</line>
<line>To &#383;peake &#383;o true at first? My Office is</line>
<line>To noyse abroad, that Harry Monmouth fell</line>
<line>Vnder the Wrath of Noble Hotspurres Sword:</line>
<line>And that the King, before the Dowglas Rage</line>
<line>Stoop&#8217;d his Annointed head, as low as death.</line>
<line>This haue I rumour&#8217;d through the peasant-Townes,</line>
<line>Betweene the Royall Field of Shrewsburie,</line>
<line>And this Worme-eaten-Hole of ragged Stone,</line>
<line>Where Hotspurres Father, old Northumberland,</line>
<line>Lyes crafty &#383;icke. The Postes come tyring on,</line>
<line>And not a man of them brings other newes</line>

<line>How doth my Sonne, and Brother?</line>
<line>Thou trembl'st; and the whitene&#383;&#383;e in thy Cheeke</line>
<line>Is apter then thy Tongue, to tell thy Errand.</line>
<line>Euen &#383;uch a man, &#383;o faint, &#383;o &#383;piritle&#383;&#383;e,</line>
<line>So dull, &#383;o dead in looke, &#383;o w&#339;-be-gone,</line>
<line>Drew Priams Curtaine, in the dead of night,</line>
<line>And would haue told him, Halfe his Troy was burn&#8217;d.</line>
<line>But Priam found the Fire, ere he his Tongue:</line>
<line>And I, my Percies death, ere thou report'st it.</line>
<line>This, thou would'st &#383;ay: Your Sonne did thus, and thus:</line>
<line>Your Brother, thus. So fought the Noble Dowglas,</line>
<line>Stopping my greedy eare, with their bold deeds.</line>
<line>But in the end (to &#383;top mine Eare indeed)</line>
<line>Thou hast a Sigh, to blow away this Praise,</line>
<line>Ending with Brother, Sonne, and all are dead.</line>
</speech>

<speech>

<line>Dowglas is liuing, and your Brother, yet:</line>
<line>But for my Lord, your Sonne.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>North.</speaker>
<line>Why, he is dead.</line>
<line>See what a ready tongue Suspition hath:</line>
<line>He that but feares the thing, he would not know,</line>
<line>Hath by Instinct, knowledge from others Eyes,</line>
<line>That what he feard, is chanc&#8217;d. Yet &#383;peake (Morton)</line>
<line>Tell thou thy Earle, his Diuination Lies,</line>
<line>And I will take it, as a &#383;weet Disgrace,</line>
<line>And make thee rich, for doing me &#383;uch wrong.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Mor.</speaker>
<line>You are too great, to be (by me) gainsaid:</line>
<line>Your Spirit is too true, your Feares too certaine.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>North.</speaker>
<line>Yet for all this, &#383;ay not that Percies dead.</line>
<line>I &#383;ee a &#383;trange Confe&#383;&#383;ion in thine Eye:</line>
<line>Thou &#383;hak'st thy head, and hold'st it Feare, or Sinne,</line>
<line>To &#383;peake a truth. If he be &#383;laine, &#383;ay &#383;o:</line>
<line>The Tongue offends not, that reports his death:</line>
<line>And he doth &#383;inne that doth belye the dead:</line>
<line>Not he, which &#383;ayes the dead is not aliue:</line>
<line>Yet the first bringer of vnwelcome Newes</line>
<line>Hath but a loosing Office: and his Tongue,</line>
<line>Sounds euer after as a &#383;ullen Bell</line>
<line>Remembred, knolling a departing Friend.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>L.Bar.</speaker>
<line>I cannot thinke (my Lord) your &#383;on is dead.</line>

<line>I am &#383;orry, I &#383;hould force you to beleeue</line>
<line>That, which I would to heauen, I had not &#383;eene.</line>
<line>But these mine eyes, &#383;aw him in bloody &#383;tate,</line>
<line>Rend'ring faint quittance (wearied, and out-breath&#8217;d)</line>
<line>To Henrie Monmouth, whose &#383;wift wrath beate downe</line>
<line>The neuer-daunted Percie to the earth,</line>
<line>From whence (with life) he neuer more &#383;prung vp.</line>
<line>In few; his death (whose &#383;pirit lent a fire,</line>
<line>Euen to the dullest Peazant in his Campe)</line>
<line>Being bruited once, tooke fire and heate away</line>
<line>From the best temper&#8217;d Courage in his Troopes.</line>
<line>For from his Mettle, was his Party &#383;teel&#8217;d;</line>
<line>Which once, in him abated, all the rest</line>
<line>Turn&#8217;d on themselues, like dull and heauy Lead:</line>
<line>And as the Thing, that&#8217;s heauy in it &#383;elfe,</line>
<line>Vpon enforcement, flyes with greatest &#383;peede,</line>
<line>So did our Men, heauy in Hotspurres lo&#383;&#383;e,</line>
<line>Lend to this weight, &#383;uch lightne&#383;&#383;e with their Feare,</line>
<line>That Arrowes fled not &#383;wifter toward their ayme,</line>
<line>Then did our Soldiers (ayming at their &#383;afety)</line>
<line>Fly from the field. Then was that Noble Worcester</line>
<line>Too &#383;oone ta'ne prisoner: and that furious Scot,</line>
<line>(The bloody Dowglas) whose well-labouring &#383;word</line>
<line>Had three times &#383;laine th&#8217; appearance of the King,</line>
<line>Gan vaile his &#383;tomacke, and did grace the &#383;hame</line>
<line>Of those that turn&#8217;d their backes: and in his flight,</line>
<line>Stumbling in Feare, was tooke. The &#383;umme of all,</line>
<line>Is, that the King hath wonne: and hath &#383;ent out</line>
<line>A &#383;peedy power, to encounter you my Lord,</line>
<line>Vnder the Conduct of yong Lancaster</line>
<line>And Westmerland. This is the Newes at full.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>North.</speaker>
<line>For this, I &#383;hall haue time enough to mourne.</line>
<line>In Poyson, there is Physicke: and this newes</line>
<line>(Hauing beene well) that would haue made me &#383;icke,</line>
<line>Being &#383;icke, haue in &#383;ome measure, made me well.</line>
<line>And as the Wretch, whose Feauer-weakned ioynts,</line>
<line>Like &#383;trengthle&#383;&#383;e Hindges, buckle vnder life,</line>
<line>Impatient of his Fit, breakes like a fire</line>
<line>Out of his keepers armes: Euen &#383;o, my Limbes</line>
<line>(Weak'ned with greefe) being now inrag&#8217;d with greefe,</line>
<line>Are thrice themselues. Hence therefore thou nice crutch,</line>
<line>A &#383;calie Gauntlet now, with ioynts of Steele</line>
<line>Must gloue this hand. And hence thou &#383;ickly Quoife,</line>
<line>Thou art a guard too wanton for the head,</line>
<line>Which Princes, flesh&#8217;d with Conquest, ayme to hit.</line>
<line>Now binde my Browes with Iron and approach</line>
<line>The ragged'st houre, that Time and Spight dare bring</line>
<line>To frowne vpon th&#8217; enrag&#8217;d Northumberland.</line>
<line>Let Heauen ki&#383;&#383;e Earth: now let not Natures hand</line>
<line>Keepe the wilde Flood confin&#8217;d: Let Order dye,</line>
<line>And let the world no longer be a &#383;tage</line>
<line>To feede Contention in a ling'ring Act:</line>
<line>But let one &#383;pirit of the First-borne Caine</line>
<line>Reigne in all bosomes, that each heart being &#383;et</line>
<line>On bloody Courses, the rude Scene may end,</line>
<line>And darkne&#383;&#383;e be the burier of the dead.</line>

<line>You knew he walk&#8217;d o&#8217;re perils, on an edge</line>
<line>More likely to fall in, then to get o&#8217;re:</line>

<line>Of Wounds, and Scarres; and that his forward Spirit</line>
<line>Would lift him, where mo&#8217;t trade of danger rang&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Yet did you &#383;ay go forth: and none of this</line>

<line>The gentle Arch-bishop of Yorke is vp</line>
<line>With well appointed Powres: he is a man</line>
<line>Who with a double Surety bindes his Followers.</line>
<line>My Lord (your Sonne) had onely but the Corpes,</line>
<line>But &#383;hadowes, and the &#383;hewes of men to fight.</line>
<line>For that &#383;ame word (Rebellion) did diuide</line>
<line>The action of their bodies, from their &#383;oules,</line>
<line>And they did fight with queasine&#383;&#383;e, constrain&#8217;d</line>
<line>As men drinke Potions; that their Weapons only</line>
<line>Seem&#8217;d on our &#383;ide: but for their Spirits and Soules,</line>
<line>This word (Rebellion) it had froze them vp,</line>
<line>As Fish are in a Pond. But now the Bishop</line>
<line>Turnes Insurrection to Religion,</line>
<line>Suppos&#8217;d &#383;incere, and holy in his Thoughts:</line>
<line>He's follow&#8217;d both with Body, and with Minde:</line>
<line>And doth enlarge his Rising, with the blood</line>
<line>Of faire King Richard, &#383;crap&#8217;d from Pomfret &#383;tones,</line>
<line>Deriues from heauen, his Quarrell, and his Cause:</line>
<line>Tels them, he doth bestride a bleeding Land,</line>
<line>Gasping for life, vnder great Bullingbrooke,</line>

</speech>

<speech>

<line>I knew of this before. But to &#383;peake truth,</line>

<line>Go in with me, and councell euery man</line>

If the Prince put thee into my Ser-uice for any other reason, then to &#383;et mee off, why then I haue no iudgement. Thou horson Mandrake, thou art fitter to be worne in my cap, then to wait at my heeles.

<line>What? a yong knaue and beg? Is there not wars? Is there not imployment? Doth not the K[ing]. lack &#383;ubiects? Do not the Rebels want Soldiers? Though it be a &#383;hame to be on any &#383;ide but one, it is worse &#383;hame to begge, then to be on the worst &#383;ide, were it worse then the name of Re-bellion can tell how to make it.</line>

<line>You mistake me Sir.</line>

<line>Why &#383;ir? Did I &#383;ay you were an hone&#383;t man? Set-ting my Knight-hood, and my Souldiership aside, I had lyed in my throat, if I had &#383;aid &#383;o.</line>

<line>Sir, my Lord would &#383;peake with you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Iust.</speaker>
<line>Sir Iohn Falstaffe, a word with you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<line>My good Lord: giue your Lordship good time of the day. I am glad to &#383;ee your Lordship abroad: I heard &#383;ay your Lordship was &#383;icke. I hope your Lordship goes abroad by aduise. Your Lordship (though not clean past your youth) hath yet &#383;ome &#383;mack of age in you: &#383;ome rel-lish of the &#383;altne&#383;&#383;e of Time, and I mo&#8217;t humbly beseech your Lordship, to haue a reuerend care of your health.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Iust.</speaker>
<line>Sir Iohn, I &#383;ent you before your Expedition, to</line>
<line>Shrewsburie.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<line>If it please your Lordship, I heare his Maiestie is return&#8217;d with &#383;ome discomfort from Wales.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Iust.</speaker>
<line>I talke not of his Maiesty: you would not come when I &#383;ent for you?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<line>And I heare moreouer, his Highne&#383;&#383;e is falne into this &#383;ame whorson Apoplexie.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Iust.</speaker>
<line>Well, heauen mend him. I pray let me &#383;peak with you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<line>This Apoplexie is (as I take it) a kind of Lethar-gie, a &#383;leeping of the blood, a horson Tingling.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Iust.</speaker>
<line>What tell you me of it? be it as it is.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<line>It hath it originall from much greefe; from &#383;tudy and perturbation of the braine. I haue read the cause of his effects in Galen. It is a kinde of deafene&#383;&#383;e.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Iust.</speaker>
<line>I thinke you are falne into the disease: For you heare not what I &#383;ay to you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<line>Very well (my Lord) very well: rather an't please you) it is the disease of not Listning, the malady of not Marking, that I am troubled withall.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Iust.</speaker>
<line>To punish you by the heeles, would amend the attention of your eares, &amp; I care not if I be your Physitian</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<line>I am as poore as Iob, my Lord; but not &#383;o Patient: your Lordship may minister the Potion of imprisonment to me, in respect of Pouertie: but how I &#383;hould bee your Patient, to follow your prescriptions, the wise may make &#383;ome dram of a &#383;cruple, or indeede, a &#383;cruple it &#383;elfe.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Iust.</speaker>
<line>I &#383;ent for you (when there were matters against you for your life) to come &#383;peake with me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<line>As I was then aduised by my learned Councel, in the lawes of this Land-seruice, I did not come.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Iust.</speaker>
<line>Wel, the truth is (sir Iohn) you liue in great infamy</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<line>He that buckles him in my belt, ca[n]not liue in le&#383;&#383;e.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Iust.</speaker>
<line>Your Meanes is very &#383;lender, and your wast great.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<line>I would it were otherwise: I would my Meanes were greater, and my waste &#383;lenderer.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Iust.</speaker>
<line>You haue misled the youthfull Prince.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<line>The yong Prince hath misled mee. I am the Fel-low with the great belly, and he my Dogge.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Iust.</speaker>
<line>Well, I am loth to gall a new-heal&#8217;d wound: your daies &#383;eruice at Shrewsbury, hath a little gilded ouer your Nights exploit on Gads-hill. You may thanke the vnquiet time, for your quiet o&#8217;re-posting that Action.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<line>My Lord?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Iust.</speaker>
<line>But &#383;ince all is wel, keep it &#383;o: wake not a &#383;leeping Wolfe.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<line>To wake a Wolfe, is as bad as to &#383;mell a Fox.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Iu.</speaker>
<line>What? you are as a candle, the better part burnt out</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<line>A Wa&#383;&#383;ell-Candle, my Lord; all Tallow: if I did &#383;ay of wax, my growth would approue the truth.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Iust.</speaker>
<line>There is not a white haire on your face, but &#383;hold haue his effect of grauity.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<line>His effect of grauy, grauy, grauy.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Iust.</speaker>
<line>You follow the yong Prince vp and downe, like his euill Angell.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<line>Not &#383;o (my Lord) your ill Angell is light: but I hope, he that lookes vpon mee, will take mee without, weighing: and yet, in &#383;ome respects I grant, I cannot go: I cannot tell. Vertue is of &#383;o little regard in these Costor-mongers, that true valor is turn&#8217;d Beare-heard. Pregnan-cie is made a Tapster, and hath his quicke wit wasted in giuing Recknings: all the other gifts appertinent to man (as the malice of this Age &#383;hapes them) are not woorth a Gooseberry. You that are old, consider not the capaci-ties of vs that are yong: you measure the heat of our Li-uers, with the bitternes of your gals: &amp; we that are in the vaward of our youth, I must confe&#383;&#383;e, are wagges too.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Iust.</speaker>
<line>Do you &#383;et downe your name in the &#383;crowle of youth, that are written downe old, with all the Charrac-ters of age? Haue you not a moist eye? a dry hand? a yel-low cheeke? a white beard? a decreasing leg? an incresing belly? Is not your voice broken? your winde &#383;hort? your wit &#383;ingle? and euery part about you blasted with Anti-quity? and wil you cal your &#383;elfe yong? Fy, fy, fy, &#383;ir Iohn.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<line>My Lord, I was borne with a white head, &amp; &#383;om-thing a round belly. For my voice, I haue lost it with hal-lowing and &#383;inging of Anthemes. To approue my youth farther, I will not: the truth is, I am onely olde in iudge-ment and vnderstanding: and he that will caper with mee for a thousand Markes, let him lend me the mony, &amp; haue at him. For the boxe of th&#8217; eare that the Prince gaue you, he gaue it like a rude Prince, and you tooke it like a &#383;ensi-ble Lord. I haue checkt him for it, and the yong Lion re-pents: Marry not in ashes and &#383;acke-cloath, but in new Silke, and old Sacke.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Iust.</speaker>
<line>Wel, heauen &#383;end the Prince a better companion.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<line>Heauen &#383;end the Companion a better Prince: I cannot rid my hands of him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Iust.</speaker>
<line>Well, the King hath &#383;euer&#8217;d you and Prince Har-ry, I heare you are going with Lord Iohn of Lancaster, a-gainst the Archbishop, and the Earle of Northumberland</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<line>Yes, I thanke your pretty &#383;weet wit for it: but looke you pray, (all you that ki&#383;&#383;e my Ladie Peace, at home) that our Armies ioyn not in a hot day: for if I take but two &#383;hirts out with me, and I meane not to &#383;weat ex-traordinarily: if it bee a hot day, if I brandish any thing but my Bottle, would I might neuer &#383;pit white againe: There is not a daungerous Action can peepe out his head, but I am thrust vpon it. Well, I cannot last euer.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Iust.</speaker>
<line>Well, be hone&#383;t, be hone&#383;t, and heauen ble&#383;&#383;e your</line>
<line>Expedition.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<line>Will your Lordship lend mee a thousand pound, to furnish me forth?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Iust.</speaker>
<line>Not a peny, not a peny: you are too impatient to beare cro&#383;&#383;es. Fare you well. Commend mee to my Cosin Westmerland.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<line>If I do, fillop me with a three-man-Beetle. A man can no more &#383;eparate Age and Couetousne&#383;&#383;e, then he can part yong limbes and letchery: but the Gowt galles the one, and the pox pinches the other; and &#383;o both the De-grees preuent my curses. Boy?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Page.</speaker>
<line>Sir.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<line>What money is in my purse?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Page.</speaker>
<line>Seuen groats, and two pence.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Fal.</speaker>
<line>I can get no remedy against this Consumption of the purse. Borrowing onely lingers, and lingers it out, but the disease is incureable. Go beare this letter to my Lord of Lancaster, this to the Prince, this to the Earle of Westmerland, and this to old Mistris Vrsula, whome I haue weekly &#383;worne to marry, &#383;ince I perceiu&#8217;d the first white haire on my chin. About it: you know where to finde me. A pox of this Gowt, or a Gowt of this Poxe: for the one or th&#8217; other playes the rogue with my great t&#339;: It is no matter, if I do halt, I haue the warres for my colour, and my Pension &#383;hall &#383;eeme the more reasonable. A good wit will make vse of any thing: I will turne dis-eases to commodity.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Ar.</speaker>
<line>Thus haue you heard our causes, &amp; kno our Means:</line>
<line>And my mo&#8217;t noble Friends, I pray you all</line>
<line>Speake plainly your opinions of our hopes,</line>
<line>And first (Lord Marshall) what &#383;ay you to it?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Mow.</speaker>
<line>I well allow the occasion of our Armes,</line>
<line>But gladly would be better &#383;atisfied,</line>
<line>How (in our Meanes) we &#383;hould aduance our &#383;elues</line>
<line>To looke with forhead bold and big enough</line>
<line>Vpon the Power and puisance of the King.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Hast.</speaker>
<line>Our present Musters grow vpon the File</line>
<line>To fiue and twenty thousand men of choice:</line>
<line>And our Supplies, liue largely in the hope</line>
<line>Of great Northumberland, whose bosome burnes</line>
<line>With an incensed Fire of Iniuries.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>L.Bar.</speaker>
<line>The question then (Lord Hastings) &#383;tandeth thus</line>
<line>Whether our present fiue and twenty thousand</line>
<line>May hold-vp-head, without Northumberland:</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Hast.</speaker>
<line>With him, we may.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>L.Bar.</speaker>
<line>I marry, there's the point:</line>
<line>But if without him we be thought to feeble,</line>
<line>My iudgement is, we &#383;hould not &#383;tep too farre</line>
<line>Till we had his A&#383;&#383;istance by the hand.</line>
<line>For in a Theame &#383;o bloody fac&#8217;d, as this,</line>
<line>Coniecture, Expectation, and Surmise</line>
<line>Of Aydes incertaine, &#383;hould not be admitted.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Arch.</speaker>
<line>&#8216;Tis very true Lord Bardolfe, for indeed</line>
<line>It was yong Hotspurres case, at Shrewsbury.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>L.Bar.</speaker>
<line>It was (my Lord) who lin&#8217;d himself with hope,</line>
<line>Eating the ayre, on promise of Supply,</line>
<line>Flatt'ring himselfe with Proiect of a power,</line>
<line>Much &#383;maller, then the &#383;mallest of his Thoughts,</line>
<line>And &#383;o with great imagination</line>
<line>(Proper to mad men) led his Powers to death,</line>
<line>And (winking) leap&#8217;d into destruction.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Hast.</speaker>
<line>But (by your leaue) it neuer yet did hurt,</line>
<line>To lay downe likely-hoods, and formes of hope.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>L.Bar.</speaker>
<line>Yes, if this present quality of warre,</line>
<line>Indeed the instant action: a cause on foot,</line>
<line>Liues &#383;o in hope: As in an early Spring,</line>
<line>We &#383;ee th&#8217; appearing buds, which to proue fruite,</line>
<line>Hope giues not &#383;o much warrant, as Dispaire</line>
<line>That Frosts will bite them. When we meane to build,</line>
<line>We first &#383;uruey the Plot, then draw the Modell,</line>
<line>And when we &#383;ee the figure of the house,</line>
<line>Then must we rate the cost of the Erection,</line>
<line>Which if we finde out-weighes Ability,</line>
<line>What do we then, but draw a-new the Modell</line>
<line>In fewer offices? Or at least, desist</line>
<line>To builde at all? Much more, in this great worke,</line>
<line>(Which is (almost) to plucke a Kingdome downe,</line>
<line>And &#383;et another vp) &#383;hould we &#383;uruey</line>
<line>The plot of Situation, and the Modell;</line>
<line>Consent vpon a &#383;ure Foundation:</line>
<line>Question Surueyors, know our owne estate,</line>
<line>How able &#383;uch a Worke to vndergo,</line>
<line>To weigh against his Opposite? Or else,</line>
<line>We fortifie in Paper, and in Figures,</line>
<line>Vsing the Names of men, instead of men:</line>
<line>Like one, that drawes the Modell of a house</line>
<line>Beyond his power to builde it; who (halfe through)</line>
<line>Giues o&#8217;re, and leaues his part-created Cost</line>
<line>A naked &#383;ubiect to the Weeping Clouds,</line>
<line>And waste, for churlish Winters tyranny.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Hast.</speaker>
<line>Grant that our hopes (yet likely of faire byrth)</line>
<line>Should be &#383;till-borne: and that we now po&#383;&#383;est</line>
<line>The vtmost man of expectation:</line>
<line>I thinke we are a Body &#383;trong enough</line>
<line>(Euen as we are) to equall with the King.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>L.Bar.</speaker>
<line>What is the King but fiue &amp; twenty thousand?</line>

<line>For0his diuisions (as the Times do braul)</line>
<line>Are in three Heads: one Power against the French,</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Prin.</speaker>
<line>It doth me: though it discolours the complexion of my Greatne&#383;&#383;e to acknowledge it. Doth it not &#383;hew vildely in me, to desire &#383;mall Beere?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Poin.</speaker>
<line>Why, a Prince &#383;hould not be &#383;o loosely &#383;tudied, as to remember &#383;o weake a Composition.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Prince.</speaker>
<line>Belike then, my Appetite was not Princely got: for (in troth) I do now remember the poore Crea-ture, Small Beere. But indeede these humble considera-tions make me out of loue with my Greatne&#383;&#383;e. What a disgrace is it to me, to remember thy name? Or to know thy face to morrow? Or to take note how many paire of Silk &#383;tockings y hast? (Viz. these, and those that were thy peach-colour&#8217;d ones:) Or to beare the Inuentorie of thy &#383;hirts, as one for &#383;uperfluity, and one other, for vse. But that the Tennis-Court-keeper knowes better then I, for it is a low ebbe of Linnen with thee, when thou kept'st not Racket there, as thou hast not done a great while, be-cause the rest of thy Low Countries, haue made a &#383;hift to eate vp thy Holland.</line>

<line>How ill it followes, after you haue labour&#8217;d &#383;o hard, you &#383;hould talke &#383;o idlely? Tell me how many good yong Princes would do &#383;o, their Fathers lying &#383;o &#383;icke, as yours is?</line>

<line>Shall I tell thee one thing, Pointz?</line>

<line>Go to: I &#383;tand the push of your one thing, that you'l tell.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Prin.</speaker>
<line>Why, I tell thee, it is not meet, that I &#383;hould be &#383;ad now my Father is &#383;icke: albeit I could tell to thee (as to one it pleases me, for fault of a better, to call my friend) I could be &#383;ad, and &#383;ad indeed too.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Poin.</speaker>
<line>Very hardly, vpon &#383;uch a &#383;ubiect.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Prin.</speaker>
<line>Thou think'st me as farre in the Diuels Booke, as thou, and Falstaffe, for obduracie and persistencie. Let the end try the man. But I tell thee, my hart bleeds inward-ly, that my Father is &#383;o &#383;icke: and keeping &#383;uch vild com-pany as thou art, hath in reason taken from me, all osten-tation of &#383;orrow.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Poin.</speaker>
<line>The reason?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Prin.</speaker>
<line>What would'st thou think of me, if I &#383;hold weep?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Poin.</speaker>
<line>I would thinke thee a mo&#8217;t Princely hypocrite.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Prin.</speaker>
<line>It would be euery mans thought: and thou art a ble&#383;&#383;ed Fellow, to thinke as euery man thinkes: neuer a mans thought in the world, keepes the Rode-way better then thine: euery man would thinke me an Hypocrite in-deede. And what accites your mo&#8217;t worshipful thought to thinke &#383;o?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Poin.</speaker>

</speech>

<speech>

<line>Nay, I am well &#383;poken of, I can heare it with mine owne eares: the worst that they can &#383;ay of me is, that I am a &#383;econd Brother, and that I am a proper Fellowe of my hands: and those two things I confe&#383;&#383;e I canot helpe. Looke, looke, here comes Bardolfe.</line>

<line>Hee's no Swaggerer (Hoste&#383;&#383;e:) a tame Cheater, hee: you may &#383;troake him as gently, as a Puppie Grey-hound: hee will not &#383;wagger with a Barbarie Henne, if her feathers turne backe in any &#383;hew of resistance. Call him vp (Drawer.)</line>

<line>Cheater, call you him? I will barre no hone&#383;t man my house, nor no Cheater: but I doe not loue &#383;wag-gering; I am the worse when one &#383;ayes, &#383;wagger: Feele Masters, how I &#383;hake: looke you, I warrant you.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Falst.</speaker>
<line>Fare you well, gentle Gentlemen. On Bar-dolph, leade the men away. As I returne, I will fetch off these Iustices: I doe &#383;ee the bottome of Iustice Shal-low. How &#383;ubiect wee old men are to this vice of Ly-ing? This &#383;ame &#383;taru&#8217;d Iustice hath done nothing but prate to me of the wildene&#383;&#383;e of his Youth, and the Feates hee hath done about Turnball-street, and euery third word a Lye, duer pay&#8217;d to the hearer, then the Turkes Tribute. I doe remember him at Clements Inne, like a man made after Supper, of a Cheese-paring. When hee was naked, hee was, for all the world, like a forked Radish, with a Head fantastically caru&#8217;d vpon it with a Knife. Hee was &#383;o forlorne, that his Dimensions (to any thicke &#383;ight) were inuincible. Hee was the very Genius of Famine: hee came euer in the rere-ward of the Fashion: And now is this Vices Dagger become a Squire, and talkes as familiarly of Iohn of Gaunt, as if hee had beene &#383;worne Brother to him: and Ile be &#383;worne hee neuer &#383;aw him but once in the Tilt-yard, and then he burst his Head, for crowding among the Marshals men. I &#383;aw it, and told Iohn of Gaunt, hee beat his owne Name, for you might haue tru&#383;&#383;&#8217;d him and all his Ap-parrell into an Eele-skinne: the Case of a Treble H&#339;-boy was a Mansion for him: a Court: and now hath hee Land, and Beeues. Well, I will be acquainted with him, if I returne: and it &#383;hall goe hard, but I will make him a Philosophers two Stones to me. If the young Dace be a Bayt for the old Pike, I &#383;ee no reason, in the Law of Nature, but I may &#383;nap at him. Let time &#383;hape, and there an end.</line>

<line>Turning your Bookes to Graues, your Inke to Blood,</line>
<line>Your Pennes to Launces, and your Tongue diuine</line>
<line>To a lowd Trumpet, and a Point of Warre.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Bish.</speaker>
<line>Wherefore doe I this? &#383;o the Question &#383;tands.</line>
<line>Briefely to this end: Wee are all diseas&#8217;d,</line>
<line>And with our &#383;urfetting, and wanton howres,</line>
<line>Haue brought our &#383;elues into a burning Feuer,</line>
<line>And wee must bleede for it: of which Disease,</line>
<line>Our late King Richard (being infected) dy&#8217;d.</line>
<line>But (my mo&#8217;t Noble Lord of Westmerland)</line>
<line>I take not on me here as a Physician,</line>
<line>Nor doe I, as an Enemie to Peace,</line>
<line>Troope in the Throngs of Militarie men:</line>
<line>But rather &#383;hew a while like fearefull Warre,</line>
<line>To dyet ranke Mindes, &#383;icke of happine&#383;&#383;e,</line>
<line>And purge th&#8217; obstructions, which begin to &#383;top</line>
<line>Our very Veines of Life: heare me more plainely.</line>
<line>I haue in equall ballance iustly weigh&#8217;d,</line>
<line>What wrongs our Arms may do, what wrongs we &#383;uffer,</line>
<line>And finde our Griefes heauier then our Offences.</line>
<line>Wee &#383;ee which way the &#383;treame of Time doth runne,</line>
<line>And are enforc&#8217;d from our mo&#8217;t quiet there,</line>
<line>By the rough Torrent of Occasion,</line>
<line>And haue the &#383;ummarie of all our Griefes</line>
<line>(When time &#383;hall &#383;erue) to &#383;hew in Articles;</line>
<line>Which long ere this, wee offer&#8217;d to the King,</line>
<line>And might, by no Suit, gayne our Audience:</line>
<line>When wee are wrong&#8217;d, and would vnfold our Griefes,</line>
<line>Wee are deny&#8217;d acce&#383;&#383;e vnto his Person,</line>
<line>Euen by those men, that mo&#8217;t haue done vs wrong.</line>
<line>The dangers of the dayes but newly gone,</line>
<line>Whose memorie is written on the Earth</line>
<line>With yet appearing blood; and the examples</line>
<line>Of euery Minutes instance (present now)</line>
<line>Hath put vs in these ill-beseeming Armes:</line>
<line>Not to breake Peace, or any Branch of it,</line>
<line>But to establish here a Peace indeede,</line>
<line>Concurring both in Name and Qualitie.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>West.</speaker>
<line>When euer yet was your Appeale deny&#8217;d?</line>
<line>Wherein haue you beene galled by the King?</line>
<line>What Peere hath beene &#383;uborn&#8217;d, to grate on you,</line>
<line>That you &#383;hould &#383;eale this lawle&#383;&#383;e bloody Booke</line>
<line>Of forg&#8217;d Rebellion, with a Seale diuine?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Bish.</speaker>
<line>My Brother generall, the Common-wealth,</line>
<line>I make my Quarrell, in particular.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>West.</speaker>
<line>There is no neede of any &#383;uch redre&#383;&#383;e:</line>
<line>Or if there were, it not belongs to you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Mow.</speaker>
<line>Why not to him in part, and to vs all,</line>
<line>That feele the bruizes of the dayes before,</line>
<line>And &#383;uffer the Condition of these Times</line>
<line>To lay a heauie and vnequall Hand vpon our Honors?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>West.</speaker>
<line>O my good Lord Mowbray,</line>
<line>Construe the Times to their Nece&#383;&#383;ities,</line>
<line>And you &#383;hall &#383;ay (indeede) it is the Time,</line>
<line>And not the King, that doth you iniuries.</line>
<line>Yet for your part, it not appeares to me,</line>
<line>Either from the King, or in the present Time,</line>
<line>That you &#383;hould haue an ynch of any ground</line>
<line>To build a Griefe on: were you not restor&#8217;d</line>
<line>To all the Duke of Norfolkes Seignories,</line>
<line>Your Noble, and right well-remembred Fathers?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Mow.</speaker>
<line>What thing, in Honor, had my Father lost,</line>
<line>That need to be reuiu&#8217;d, and breath&#8217;d in me?</line>
<line>The King that lou&#8217;d him, as the State &#383;tood then,</line>
<line>Was forc&#8217;d, perforce compell&#8217;d to banish him:</line>
<line>And then, that Henry Bullingbrooke and hee</line>
<line>Being mounted, and both rowsed in their Seates,</line>
<line>Their neighing Coursers daring of the Spurre,</line>
<line>Their armed Staues in charge, their Beauers downe,</line>
<line>Their eyes of fire, &#383;parkling through &#383;ights of Steele,</line>
<line>And the lowd Trumpet blowing them together:</line>
<line>Then, then, when there was nothing could haue &#383;tay&#8217;d</line>
<line>My Father from the Breast of Bullingbrooke;</line>
<line>O, when the King did throw his Warder downe,</line>
<line>(His owne Life hung vpon the Staffe hee threw)</line>
<line>Then threw hee downe himselfe, and all their Liues,</line>
<line>That by Indictment, and by dint of Sword,</line>
<line>Haue &#383;ince mis-carryed vnder Bullingbrooke.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>West.</speaker>
<line>You &#383;peak (Lord Mowbray) now you know not what.</line>
<line>The Earle of Hereford was reputed then</line>
<line>In England the mo&#8217;t valiant Gentleman.</line>
<line>Who knowes, on whom Fortune would then haue &#383;mil&#8217;d?</line>
<line>But if your Father had beene Victor there,</line>
<line>Hee ne're had borne it out of Couentry.</line>
<line>For all the Countrey, in a generall voyce,</line>
<line>Cry&#8217;d hate vpon him: and all their prayers, and loue,</line>
<line>Were &#383;et on Herford, whom they doted on,</line>
<line>And ble&#383;&#383;&#8217;d, and grac&#8217;d, and did more then the King.</line>
<line>But this is meere digre&#383;&#383;ion from my purpose.</line>
<line>Here come I from our Princely Generall,</line>
<line>To know your Griefes; to tell you, from his Grace,</line>
<line>That hee will giue you Audience: and wherein</line>
<line>It &#383;hall appeare, that your demands are iust,</line>
<line>You &#383;hall enioy them, euery thing &#383;et off,</line>
<line>That might &#383;o much as thinke you Enemies.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Mow.</speaker>
<line>But hee hath forc&#8217;d vs to compell this Offer,</line>
<line>And it proceedes from Pollicy, not Loue.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>West.</speaker>
<line>Mowbray, you ouer-weene to take it &#383;o:</line>
<line>This Offer comes from Mercy, not from Feare.</line>
<line>For l&#339;, within a Ken our Army lyes,</line>
<line>Vpon mine Honor, all too confident</line>
<line>To giue admittance to a thought of feare.</line>
<line>Our Battaile is more full of Names then yours,</line>
<line>Our Men more perfect in the vse of Armes,</line>
<line>Our Armor all as &#383;trong, our Cause the best;</line>
<line>Then Reason will, our hearts &#383;hould be as good.</line>
<line>Say you not then, our Offer is compell&#8217;d.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Mow.</speaker>
<line>Well, by my will, wee &#383;hall admit no Parley.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>West.</speaker>
<line>That argues but the &#383;hame of your offence:</line>
<line>A rotten Case abides no handling.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Hast.</speaker>
<line>Hath the Prince Iohn a full Commi&#383;&#383;ion,</line>
<line>In very ample vertue of his Father,</line>
<line>To heare, and absolutely to determine</line>
<line>Of what Conditions wee &#383;hall &#383;tand vpon?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>West.</speaker>
<line>That is intended in the Generals Name:</line>
<line>I muse you make &#383;o &#383;light a Question.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Bish.</speaker>
<line>Then take (my Lord of Westmerland) this Schedule,</line>
<line>For this containes our generall Grieuances:</line>
<line>Each &#383;euerall Article herein redre&#383;&#383;&#8217;d,</line>
<line>All members of our Cause, both here, and hence,</line>
<line>That are insinewed to this Action,</line>
<line>Acquitted by a true &#383;ubstantiall forme,</line>
<line>And present execution of our wills,</line>
<line>To vs, and to our purposes confin&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Wee come within our awfull Banks againe,</line>
<line>And knit our Powers to the Arme of Peace.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>West.</speaker>
<line>This will I &#383;hew the Generall. Please you Lords,</line>
<line>In &#383;ight of both our Battailes, wee may meete</line>
<line>At either end in peace: which Heauen &#383;o frame,</line>
<line>Or to the place of difference call the Swords,</line>
<line>Which must decide it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Bish.</speaker>
<line>My Lord, wee will doe &#383;o.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Mow.</speaker>
<line>There is a thing within my Bosome tells me,</line>
<line>That no Conditions of our Peace can &#383;tand.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Hast.</speaker>
<line>Feare you not, that if wee can make our Peace</line>
<line>Vpon &#383;uch large termes, and &#383;o absolute,</line>
<line>As our Conditions &#383;hall consist vpon,</line>
<line>Our Peace &#383;hall &#383;tand as firme as Rockie Mountaines.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Mow.</speaker>
<line>I, but our valuation &#383;hall be &#383;uch,</line>
<line>That euery &#383;light, and false-deriued Cause,</line>
<line>Yea, euery idle, nice, and wanton Reason,</line>
<line>Shall, to the King, taste of this Action:</line>
<line>That were our Royall faiths, Martyrs in Loue,</line>
<line>Wee &#383;hall be winnowed with &#383;o rough a winde,</line>
<line>That euen our Corne &#383;hall &#383;eeme as light as Chaffe,</line>
<line>And good from bad finde no partition.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Bish.</speaker>
<line>No, no (my Lord) note this: the King is wearie</line>
<line>Of daintie, and &#383;uch picking Grieuances:</line>
<line>For hee hath found, to end one doubt by Death,</line>
<line>Reuiues two greater in the Heires of Life.</line>
<line>And therefore will hee wipe his Tables cleane,</line>
<line>And keepe no Tell-tale to his Memorie,</line>
<line>That may repeat, and Historie his lo&#383;&#383;e,</line>
<line>To new remembrance. For full well hee knowes,</line>
<line>Hee cannot &#383;o precisely weede this Land,</line>
<line>As his mis-doubts present occasion:</line>
<line>His f&#339;s are &#383;o en-rooted with his friends,</line>
<line>That plucking to vnfixe an Enemie,</line>
<line>Hee doth vnfasten &#383;o, and &#383;hake a friend.</line>
<line>So that this Land, like an offensiue wife,</line>
<line>That hath enrag&#8217;d him on, to offer &#383;trokes,</line>
<line>As he is &#383;triking, holds his Infant vp,</line>
<line>And hangs resolu&#8217;d Correction in the Arme,</line>
<line>That was vprear&#8217;d to execution.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Hast.</speaker>
<line>Besides, the King hath wasted all his Rods,</line>
<line>On late Offenders, that he now doth lacke</line>
<line>The very Instruments of Chasticement:</line>
<line>So that his power, like to a Fangle&#383;&#383;e Lion</line>
<line>May offer, but not hold.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Bish.</speaker>
<line>&#8216;Tis very true:</line>
<line>And therefore be a&#383;&#383;ur&#8217;d (my good Lord Marshal)</line>
<line>If we do now make our attonement well,</line>
<line>Our Peace, will (like a broken Limbe vnited)</line>
<line>Grow &#383;tronger, for the breaking.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Mow.</speaker>
<line>Be it &#383;o:</line>
<line>Heere is return&#8217;d my Lord of Westmerland.</line>

<line>When that your Flocke (a&#383;&#383;embled by the Bell)</line>
<line>Encircled you, to heare with reuerence</line>
<line>Your exposition on the holy Text,</line>
<line>Then now to &#383;ee you heere an Iron man</line>
<line>Chearing a rowt of Rebels with your Drumme,</line>
<line>Turning the Word, to Sword; and Life to death:</line>
<line>That man that &#383;its within a Monarches heart,</line>
<line>And ripens in the Sunne-shine of his fauor,</line>
<line>Would hee abuse the Countenance of the King,</line>
<line>Alack, what Mischiefes might hee &#383;et abroach,</line>
<line>In &#383;hadow of &#383;uch Greatne&#383;&#383;e? With you, Lord Bishop,</line>
<line>It is euen &#383;o. Who hath not heard it &#383;poken,</line>
<line>How deepe you were within the Bookes of Heauen?</line>
<line>To vs, the Speaker in his Parliament;</line>
<line>To vs, th&#8217; imagine Voyce of Heauen it &#383;elfe:</line>
<line>The very Opener, and Intelligencer,</line>
<line>Betweene the Grace, the Sanctities of Heauen;</line>
<line>And our dull workings. O, who &#383;hall beleeue,</line>
<line>But you mis-vse the reuerence of your Place,</line>
<line>Employ the Countenance, and Grace of Heauen,</line>
<line>As a false Fauorite doth his Princes Name,</line>
<line>In deedes dis-honorable? You haue taken vp,</line>
<line>Vnder the counterfeited Zeale of Heauen,</line>
<line>The Subiects of Heauens Substitute, my Father,</line>
<line>And both against the Peace of Heauen, and him,</line>
<line>Haue here vp-swarmed them.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Bish.</speaker>
<line>Good my Lord of Lancaster,</line>
<line>I am not here against your Fathers Peace:</line>
<line>But (as I told my Lord of Westmerland)</line>
<line>The Time (mis-order&#8217;d) doth in common &#383;ence</line>
<line>Crowd vs, and crush vs, to this monstrous Forme,</line>
<line>To hold our &#383;afetie vp. I &#383;ent your Grace</line>

<line>To the last man.</line>
</speech>

<speech>

<line>And &#383;o, &#383;ucce&#383;&#383;e of Mischiefe &#383;hall be borne,</line>

<line>And neither partie looser.</line>
</speech>

<line>East, West, North, South: or like a Schoole, broke vp,</line>
<line>Each hurryes towards his home, and &#383;porting place.</line>

<line>But for you (Rebels) looke to taste the due</line>
<line>Meet for Rebellion, and &#383;uch Acts as yours.</line>
<line>Mo&#8217;t &#383;hallowly did you these Armes commence,</line>

<line>I would bee &#383;orry (my Lord) but it &#383;hould bee thus: I neuer knew yet, but rebuke and checke was the reward of Valour. Doe you thinke me a Swallow, an Ar-row, or a Bullet?

<line>I would you had but the wit: 'twere better then your Dukedome. Good faith, this &#383;ame young &#383;o-ber-blooded Boy doth not loue me, nor a man cannot make him laugh: but that&#8217;s no maruaile, hee drinkes no Wine. There's neuer any of these demure Boyes come to any proofe: for thinne Drinke doth &#383;o ouer-coole their blood, and making many Fish-Meales, that they fall into a kinde of Male Greene-sickne&#383;&#383;e: and then, when they marry, they get Wenches. They are generally Fooles, and Cowards; which &#383;ome of vs &#383;hould be too, but for inflamation. A good Sherris-Sack hath a two-fold operation in it: it ascends me into the Braine, dryes me there all the foolish, and dull, and cruddie Vapours, which enuiron it: makes it apprehensiue, quicke, forge-tiue, full of nimble, fierie, and delectable &#383;hapes; which deliuer&#8217;d o&#8217;re to the Voyce, the Tongue, which is the Birth, becomes excellent Wit. The &#383;econd propertie of your excellent Sherris, is, the warming of the Blood: which before (cold, and &#383;etled) left the Liuer white, and pale; which is the Badge of Pusillanimitie, and Cowar-dize: but the Sherris warmes it, and makes it course from the inwards, to the parts extremes: it illuminateth the Face, which (as a Beacon) giues warning to all the rest of this little Kingdome (Man) to Arme: and then the Vitall Commoners, and in-land pettie Spirits, muster me all to their Captaine, the Heart; who great, and pufft vp with his Retinue, doth any Deed of Courage: and this Valour comes of Sherris. So, that &#383;kill in the Weapon is nothing, without Sack (for that &#383;ets it a-worke:) and Learning, a meere Hoord of Gold, kept by a Deuill, till Sack commences it, and &#383;ets it in act, and vse. Hereof comes it, that Prince Harry is valiant: for the cold blood hee did naturally inherite of his Father, hee hath, like leane, &#383;tirrill, and bare Land, manured, husbanded, and tyll&#8217;d, with excellent endeauour of drinking good, and good &#383;tore of fertile Sherris, that hee is become very hot, and valiant. If I had a thousand Sonnes, the first Principle I would teach them, &#383;hould be to forsweare thinne Pota-tions, and to addict themselues to Sack. <stagedir>Enter Bardolph.</stagedir> How now Bardolph?</line>

<line>And Noble Offices thou may'st effect</line>
<line>Of Mediation (after I am dead)</line>

<line>Nor loose the good aduantage of his Grace,</line>
<line>By &#383;eeming cold, or carele&#383;&#383;e of his will.</line>
<line>For hee is gracious, if hee be obseru&#8217;d:</line>
<line>Hee hath a Teare for Pitie, and a Hand</line>
<line>Open (as Day) for melting Charitie:</line>
<line>Yet notwithstanding, being incens&#8217;d, hee's Flint,</line>
<line>As humorous as Winter, and as &#383;udden,</line>
<line>As Flawes congealed in the Spring of day.</line>
<line>His temper therefore must be well obseru&#8217;d:</line>
<line>Chide him for faults, and doe it reuerently,</line>
<line>When you perceiue his blood enclin&#8217;d to mirth:</line>
<line>But being moodie, giue him Line, and &#383;cope,</line>

<line>My gracious Lord, you looke beyond him quite:</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Prince.</speaker>
<line>O pardon me (my Liege)</line>
<line>But for my Teares,</line>
<line>The mo&#8217;t Impediments vnto my Speech,</line>
<line>I had fore-stall&#8217;d this deere, and deepe Rebuke,</line>
<line>Ere you (with greefe) had &#383;poke, and I had heard</line>
<line>The course of it &#383;o farre. There is your Crowne,</line>
<line>And he that weares the Crowne immortally,</line>
<line>Long guard it yours. If I affect it more,</line>
<line>Then as your Honour, and as your Renowne,</line>
<line>Let me no more from this Obedience rise,</line>
<line>Which my mo&#8217;t true, and inward duteous Spirit</line>
<line>Teacheth this prostrate, and exteriour bending.</line>
<line>Heauen witne&#383;&#383;e with me, when I heere came in,</line>
<line>And found no course of breath within your Maiestie,</line>
<line>How cold it &#383;trooke my heart. If I do faine,</line>
<line>O let me, in my present wildene&#383;&#383;e, dye,</line>
<line>And neuer liue, to &#383;hew th&#8217; incredulous World,</line>
<line>The Noble change that I haue purposed.</line>
<line>Comming to looke on you, thinking you dead,</line>
<line>(And dead almost (my Liege) to thinke you were)</line>
<line>I &#383;pake vnto the Crowne (as hauing &#383;ense)</line>
<line>And thus vpbraided it. The Care on thee depending,</line>
<line>Hath fed vpon the body of my Father,</line>
<line>Therefore, thou best of Gold, art worst of Gold.</line>
<line>Other, le&#383;&#383;e fine in Charract, is more precious,</line>
<line>Preseruing life, in Med'cine potable:</line>
<line>But thou, mo&#8217;t Fine, mo&#8217;t Honour&#8217;d, mo&#8217;t Renown&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Hast eate the Bearer vp.</line>
<line>Thus (my Royall Liege)</line>
<line>Accusing it, I put it on my Head,</line>
<line>To try with it (as with an Enemie,</line>
<line>That had before my face murdred my Father)</line>
<line>The Quarrell of a true Inheritor.</line>
<line>But if it did infect my blood with Ioy,</line>
<line>Or &#383;well my Thoughts, to any &#383;traine of Pride,</line>
<line>If any Rebell, or vaine &#383;pirit of mine,</line>
<line>Did, with the least Affection of a Welcome,</line>
<line>Giue entertainment to the might of it,</line>
<line>Let heauen, for euer, keepe it from my head,</line>
<line>And make me, as the poorest Va&#383;&#383;aile is,</line>
<line>That doth with awe, and terror kneele to it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>O my Sonne!</line>
<line>Heauen put it in thy minde to take it hence,</line>
<line>That thou might'st ioyne the more, thy Fathers loue,</line>
<line>Pleading &#383;o wisely, in excuse of it.</line>
<line>Come hither Harrie, &#383;it thou by my bedde,</line>
<line>And heare (I thinke, the very latest Counsell</line>
<line>That euer I &#383;hall breath: Heauen knowes, my Sonne)</line>
<line>By what by-pathes, and indirect crook&#8217;d-wayes</line>
<line>I met this Crowne: and I my &#383;elfe know well</line>
<line>How troublesome it &#383;ate vpon my head.</line>
<line>To thee, it &#383;hall descend with better Quiet,</line>
<line>Better Opinion, better Confirmation:</line>
<line>For all the &#383;oyle of the Atchieuement goes</line>
<line>With me, into the Earth. It &#383;eem&#8217;d in mee,</line>
<line>But as an Honour &#383;natch&#8217;d with boyst'rous hand,</line>
<line>And I had many liuing, to vpbraide</line>
<line>My gaine of it, by their A&#383;&#383;istances,</line>
<line>Which dayly grew to Quarrell, and to Blood-shed,</line>
<line>Wounding &#383;upposed Peace.</line>
<line>All these bold Feares,</line>
<line>Thou &#383;eest (with perill) I haue answered:</line>
<line>For all my Reigne, hath beene but as a Scene</line>
<line>Acting that argument. And now my death</line>
<line>Changes the Moode: For what in me, was purchas&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Falles vpon thee, in a more Fayrer &#383;ort.</line>
<line>So thou, the Garland wear'st &#383;ucce&#383;&#383;iuely.</line>
<line>Yet, though thou &#383;tand'st more &#383;ure, then I could do,</line>
<line>Thou art not firme enough, &#383;ince greefes are greene:</line>
<line>And all thy Friends, which thou must make thy Friends</line>
<line>Haue but their &#383;tings, and teeth, newly tak'n out,</line>
<line>By whose fell working, I was first aduanc&#8217;d,</line>
<line>And by whose power, I well might lodge a Feare</line>
<line>To be againe displac&#8217;d. Which to auoyd,</line>
<line>I cut them off: and had a purpose now</line>
<line>To leade out many to the Holy Land;</line>
<line>Least rest, and lying &#383;till, might make them looke</line>
<line>Too neere vnto my State.</line>
<line>Therefore (my Harrie)</line>
<line>Be it thy course to busie giddy Mindes</line>
<line>With Forraigne Quarrels: that Action hence borne out,</line>
<line>May waste the memory of the former dayes.</line>
<line>More would I, but my Lungs are wasted &#383;o,</line>

<line>Ile follow you, good Master Robert Shallow. Bardolfe, looke to our Hor&#383;&#383;es. If I were &#383;aw&#8217;de into Quantities, I &#383;hould make foure dozen of &#383;uch bearded Hermites &#383;taues, as Master Shallow. It is a wonderfull thing to &#383;ee the &#383;emblable Coherence of his mens &#383;pirits, and his: They, by obseruing of him, do beare themselues like foolish Iustices: Hee, by conuersing with them, is turn&#8217;d into a Iustice-like Seruingman. Their &#383;pirits are &#383;o married in Coniunction, with the participation of So-ciety, that they flocke together in consent, like &#383;o ma-ny Wilde-Geese. If I had a &#383;uite to Mayster Shallow, I would humour his men, with the imputation of beeing neere their Mayster. If to his Men, I would currie with Maister Shallow, that no man could better command his Seruants. It is certaine, that either wise bearing, or ig-norant Carriage is caught, as men take diseases, one of another: therefore, let men take heede of their Compa-nie. I will deuise matter enough out of this Shallow, to keepe Prince Harry in continuall Laughter, the wearing out of &#383;ixe Fashions (which is foure Tearmes) or two Ac-tions, and he &#383;hall laugh with Interuallums. O it is much that a Lye (with a &#383;light Oath) and a iest (with a &#383;adde brow) will doe, with a Fellow, that neuer had the Ache in his &#383;houlders. O you &#383;hall &#383;ee him laugh, till his Face be like a wet Cloake, ill laid vp.</line>

<line>And did commit you. If the deed were ill,</line>
<line>Be you contented, wearing now the Garland,</line>
<line>To haue a Sonne, &#383;et your Decrees at naught?</line>
<line>To plucke downe Iustice from your awefull Bench?</line>
<line>To trip the course of Law, and blunt the Sword</line>
<line>That guards the peace, and &#383;afety of your Person?</line>
<line>Nay more, to &#383;purne at your mo&#8217;t Royall Image,</line>
<line>And mocke your workings, in a Second body?</line>
<line>Question your Royall Thoughts, make the case yours:</line>

<line>After this cold considerance, &#383;entence me;</line>
<line>And, as you are a King, &#383;peake in your State,</line>
<line>What I haue done, that misbecame my place,</line>
<line>My person, or my Lieges Soueraigntie.</line>

<line>You are right Iustice, and you weigh this well:</line>

<line>And I do wish your Honors may encrease,</line>
<line>Till you do liue, to &#383;ee a Sonne of mine</line>
<line>Offend you, and obey you, as I did.</line>

<line>That dares do Iustice, on my proper Sonne;</line>

<line>That would deliuer vp his Greatne&#383;&#383;e &#383;o,</line>
<line>Into the hands of Iustice. You did commit me:</line>
<line>For which, I do commit into your hand,</line>
<line>Th&#8217; vnstained Sword that you haue vs&#8217;d to beare:</line>
<line>With this Remembrance; That you vse the &#383;ame</line>

<line>You &#383;hall be as a Father, to my Youth:</line>

<line>And I will &#383;toope, and humble my Intents,</line>
<line>To your well-practis&#8217;d, wise Directions.</line>
<line>And Princes all, beleeue me, I beseech you:</line>
<line>My Father is gone wilde into his Graue,</line>
<line>(For in his Tombe, lye my Affections)</line>
<line>And with his Spirits, &#383;adly I &#383;uruiue,</line>
<line>To mocke the expectation of the World;</line>
<line>To frustrate Prophesies, and to race out</line>
<line>Rotten Opinion, who hath writ me downe</line>
<line>After my &#383;eeming. The Tide of Blood in me,</line>
<line>Hath prowdly flow&#8217;d in Vanity, till now.</line>
<line>Now doth it turne, and ebbe backe to the Sea,</line>
<line>Where it &#383;hall mingle with the &#383;tate of Floods,</line>

<line>Now call we our High Court of Parliament,</line>

<line>That the great Body of our State may go</line>
<line>In equall ranke, with the best gouern&#8217;d Nation,</line>

<line>As things acquainted and familiar to vs,</line>
<line>In which you (Father) &#383;hall haue formost hand.</line>
<line>Our Coronation done, we will accite</line>

<speaker>EPILOGVE.</speaker>
<line>First, my Feare: then, my Curtsie: last, my Speech. My Feare, is your Displeasure: My Curtsie, my Dutie: And my &#383;peech, to Begge your Pardons. If you looke for a good &#383;peech now, you vnd&#339; me: For what I haue to &#383;ay, is of mine owne making: and what (indeed) I &#383;hould &#383;ay, will (I doubt) prooue mine owne marring. But to the Purpose, and &#383;o to the Venture. Be it knowne to you (as it is very well) I was lately heere in the end of a displeasing Play, to pray your Patience for it, and to promise you a Better: I did meane (indeede) to pay you with this, which if (like an ill Venture) it come vnluckily home, I breake; and you, my gen= tle Creditors lose. Heere I promist you I would be, and heere I commit my Bodie to your Mercies: Bate me &#383;ome, and I will pay you &#383;ome, and (as mo&#8217;t Debtors do) promise you infinitely. If my Tongue cannot entreate you to acquit me: will you command me to vse my Legges? And yet that were but light payment, to Dance out of your debt: But a good Conscience, will make any po&#383;&#383;ible &#383;atisfaction, and &#383;o will I. All these Gen= tlewomen heere, haue forgiuen me, if the Gentlemen will not, then the Gentlemen do not agree with the Gentlewomen, which was neuer &#383;eene before, in &#383;uch an As &#383;embly. One word more, I beseech you: if you be not too much cloid with Fat Meate, our humble Author will continue the Story (with Sir Iohn in it) and make you merry, with faire Katherine of France: where (for any thing I know) Fal- &#383;taffe &#383;hall dye of a &#383;weat, vnle&#383;&#383;e already he be kill&#8217;d with your hard Opinions: For Old-Castle dyed a Martyr, and this is not the man. My Tongue is wearie, when my Legs are too, I will bid you good night; and &#383;o kneele downe before you; But (indeed) to pray for the Queene. THE ACTORS NAMES. Rumour the Presentor.
