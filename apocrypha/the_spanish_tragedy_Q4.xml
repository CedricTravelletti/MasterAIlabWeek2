<stagedir>Enter the Ghoast of Andrea, and with him <lb/>Reuenge.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>Ghoast.</speaker>
<line order="first"><dropcap type="floral">W</dropcap>Hen this eternall substance of my soule</line>
<line order="second">Did liue imprisond in my wanton flesh,</line>
<line order="third">Ech in their function seruing others need,</line>
<line>I was a courtier in the Spanish court:</line>
<line>My name was <nameref>Don Andrea</nameref>; my discent,</line>
<line>Though not ignoble, yet inferiour far</line>
<line>To gratious fortunes of my tender youth,</line>
<line>For there, in prime and pride of all my yeeres,</line>
<line>By duteous seruice and deseruing loue,</line>
<line>In secret I possest a worthy dame,</line>
<line>Which hight sweet <nameref>Bel-imperia</nameref> by name.</line>
<line>But in the haruest of my sommer ioyes</line>
<line>Deaths winter nipt the blossomes of my blisse,</line>
<line>Forcing diuorce betwixt my loue and me;</line>
<line>For in the late conflict with Portingale</line>
<line>My valour drew me into dangers mouth</line>
<line>Till life to death made passage through my wounds.</line>
<line>When I was slaine, my soule descended straight</line>
<line>To passe the flowing streame of Archeron;</line>
<line>But churlish <nameref>Charon</nameref>, only boatman there,</line>
<line>Said that, my rites of buriall not performde,</line>
<line>I might not sit amongst his passengers.</line>
<line>Ere Sol had slept three nights in <nameref>Thetis</nameref> lap,</line>
<line>And slakte his smoaking charriot in her floud,</line>
<line>By <nameref>Don Horatio</nameref>, our knight-marshals sonne,</line>
<line>My funerals and obsequies were done.</line>
<line>Then was the fariman of hell content</line>
<line>To passe me ouer to the slimie strond</line>
<line>That leades to fell <nameref>Auernus</nameref> ougly waues.</line>
<line>There, pleasing Cerberus with honied speech,</line>
<line>I past the perils of the formost porch.</line>
<line>Not farre from hence, amidst ten thousand soules,</line>
<line>Sate <nameref>Minos</nameref>, <nameref>Eacus</nameref> and <nameref>Rhadamant</nameref>;</line>
<line>To whome no sooner gan I make approach,</line>
<line>To craue a pasport for my wandring ghost,</line>
<line>But Minos in grauen leaues of lotterie</line>
<line>Drew forth the manner of my life and death.</line>
<line>"This knight," quoth he, "both liu'd and died in loue;</line>
<line>And for his loue tried fortune of the warres;</line>
<line>And by warres fortune lost both loue and life."</line>
<line>"Why then," said <nameref>Eacus</nameref>, "convey him hence</line>
<line>To walke with lovers in our field of loue</line>
<line>And the course of euerlasting time</line>
<line>Vnder greene mirtle-trees and cipresse shades."</line>
<line>"No, no!" said <nameref>Rhadamant</nameref>, "it were not well</line>
<line>With louing soules to place a martialist.</line>
<line>He died in warre, and must to martiall fields,</line>
<line>Where wounded <nameref>Hector</nameref> liues in lasting paine,</line>
<line>And <nameref>Achilles</nameref> Mermedons do scoure the plaine."</line>
<line>Then <nameref>Minos</nameref>, mildest censor of the three,</line>
<line>Made this deuice, to end the difference:</line>
<line>"Send him," quoth he, "to our infernall king,</line>
<line>To dome him as best seemes his Maiestie."</line>
<line>To this effect my pasport straight was drawne.</line>
<line>In keeping on my way to <nameref>Plutos</nameref> court</line>
<line>Through dreadfull shades of euer-glooming night,</line>
<line>I saw more sights than thousand tongues can tell</line>
<line>Or pennes can write or mortall harts can think.</line>
<line>Three waies there were: that on the right hand side</line>
<line>Was ready way vnto the foresaid fields</line>
<line>Where louers liue and bloudie martialists,</line>
<line>But either sort containd within his bounds;</line>
<line>The left hand path, declining fearfuly,</line>
<line>Was ready downfall to the deepest hell,</line>
<line>Where bloudie Furies shakes their whips of steele,</line>
<line>And poore <nameref>Ixion</nameref> turnes an endles wheele,</line>
<line>Where vsurers are choakt with melting golde,</line>
<line>And wantons are imbraste with ougly snakes,</line>
<line>And murderers groane with neuer-killing wounds,</line>
<line>And periured wights scalded in boiling lead,</line>
<line>And all foule sinnes with torments ouerwhelmd;</line>
<line>Twixt these two waies I trod the middle path,</line>
<line>Which brought me to the faire Elizian greene,</line>
<line>In midst whereof there standes a stately towre,</line>
<line>The walles of brasse, the gates of adamant.</line>
<line>Heere finding <nameref>Pluto</nameref> with his <nameref>Proserpine</nameref>,</line>
<line>I shewed my pasport, humbled on my knee.</line>
<line>Whereat faire <nameref>Proserpine</nameref> began to smile,</line>
<line>And begd that onely she might giue me doome.</line>
<line><nameref>Pluto</nameref> was pleasd, and sealde it with a kisse.</line>
<line>Forthwith (<nameref>Reuenge</nameref>) she rounded thee in th' eare,</line>
<line>And bad thee lead me though the gates of horn,</line>
<line>Where dreames haue passage in the silent night.</line>
<line>No sooner had she spoke but we weere heere,</line>
<line>I wot not how, in the twinkling of an eye.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Reuenge.</speaker>
<line>Then know <nameref>Andrea</nameref> that thou ariu'd</line>
<line>Where thou shalt see the author of thy death,</line>
<line><nameref>Don Balthazar</nameref>, the prince of Portingale,</line>
<line>Depriu'd of life by <nameref>Bel-imperia</nameref>:</line>
<line>Heere sit we downe to see the misterie,</line>
<line>And serue for <nameref>Chorus</nameref> in this tragedie.</line>

<line>That are deceast by fortune of the warre.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>But what portends thy cheerefull countenance</line>
<line>And posting to our presence this in hast?</line>
<line>Speak, man: hath fortune giuen vs victorie?</line>
</speech>

<line>Then blest be Heauen, and Guider of the heauens,</line>
<line>From whose faire influence such iustice flowes!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Cast.</speaker>
<line>O multum dilecte Deo, tibi militat aether,</line>
<line>Et coniuratae curato poplite gentes</line>
<line>Succumbent: recto soror est victoria iuris!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>Thanks to my loving brother of Castille.</line>
<line>But, generall, vnfolde in breefe discourse</line>
<line>Your forme of battell and your warres successe,</line>
<line>That, adding all the pleasure of thy newes</line>
<line>Vnto the height of former happines,</line>
<line>With deeper wage and gentile dignitie</line>
<line>We may reward thy blisfull chiualrie.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Gen.</speaker>
<line>Where Spaine and Portingale do ioyntly knit</line>
<line>Their frontiers, leaning on each others bound,</line>
<line>There met our armies in the proud aray:</line>
<line>Both furnisht well, both full of hope and feare,</line>
<line>Both menacing alike with daring showes,</line>
<line>Both vaunting sundry colours of deuice,</line>
<line>Both cheerly sounding trumpets, drums and fifes,</line>
<line>Both raising dreadfull clamors to the skie,</line>
<line>That valleis, hils, and riuers made rebound</line>
<line>And heauen it-selfe was frighted with the sound.</line>
<line>Our battels both were pitcht in squadron forme,</line>
<line>Each corner strongly fenst with wings of shot;</line>
<line>But, ere we ioyned and came to push of pike,</line>
<line>I brought a squadron of our readiest shot</line>
<line>From out our rearward to begin the fight;</line>
<line>They brought another wing to incounter vs;</line>
<line>Meane-while our ordinance plaid on either side,</line>
<line>And captaines stroue to haue their valours tride.</line>
<line>Don Pedro, their chiefe horsemens corlonell,</line>
<line>Did with his cornet brauely make attempt</line>
<line>To break our order of our battell rankes;</line>
<line>But Don Rogero, worthy man of warre,</line>
<line>Marcht forth against him with our musketiers</line>
<line>And stopt the mallice of his fell approach.</line>
<line>While they maintaine hot skirmish too and fro,</line>
<line>Both battailes ioyne and fall to handie blowes,</line>
<line>Their violent shot resembling th' oceans rage</line>
<line>When, roaring lowd and with a swelling tide,</line>
<line>It beats vpon the rampiers of huge rocks,</line>
<line>And gapes to swallow neighbor-bounding lands.</line>
<line>Now, while Bellona rageth heere and there,</line>
<line>Thick stormes of bullets ran like winters haile,</line>
<line>And shiuered launces darke the troubled aire;</line>
<line>Pede pes &#38; cuspide cuspis,</line>
<line>Arma sonant armis vir petiturque viro;</line>
<line>On euery side drop captaines to the ground,</line>
<line>And souldiers, some ill-maimde, some slaine outright:</line>
<line>Heere falls a body sundred from his head;</line>
<line>There legs and armes lye bleeding on the grasse,</line>
<line>Mingled with weapons and vnboweled steeds,</line>
<line>That scattering ouer-spread the purple plaine.</line>
<line>In all this turmoyle, three long hovres and more</line>
<line>The victory to neither part inclinde,</line>
<line>Till Don Andrea with his braue lanciers</line>
<line>In their maine battell made so great a breach</line>
<line>That, halfe dismaid, the multitude retirde.</line>
<line>But Balthazar, the Portingales young prince,</line>
<line>Brought rescue and encouragde them to stay.</line>
<line>Heere-hence the fight was eagerly renewd,</line>
<line>And in that conflict was Andrea slaine,&#8212;</line>
<line>Braue man-at-arms, but weake to Balthazar.</line>
<line>Yet, while the prince, insulting ouer him,</line>
<line>Breathd out proud vaunts, sounding to our reproch,</line>
<line>Friendship and hardie valour ioyned in one</line>
<line>Prickt forth Horatio, our knight-marshals sonne,</line>
<line>To challenge forth that prince in single fight.</line>
<line>Not long betweene these twain the fight indurde,</line>
<line>But straight the prince was beaten from his horse</line>
<line>And forcst to yeeld him prisoner to his foe.</line>
<line>When he was taken, all the rest fled,</line>
<line>And our carbines pursued them to death,</line>
<line>Till, Phoebus waning to the western deepe,</line>
<line>Our trumpeters were chargd to sound retreat.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>Thanks, good l[ord] general, for these good newes!</line>
<line>And, for some argument of more to come,</line>
<line>Take this and weare it for thy soueraignes sake.</line>
<stagedir>Giue him his chaine.</stagedir>
<line>But tell me now: hast thou confirmed a peace?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Gen.</speaker>
<line>No peace, my liege, but peace conditionall,</line>
<line>That, if with homage tribute be well paid,</line>
<line>The fury of your forces wilbe staide.</line>
<line>And to this peace their viceroy hath subscribde,</line>

<stagedir>Giue the K[ING] a paper.</stagedir>
<line>And made a solemne vow that during life</line>
<line>His tribute shalbe truely paid to Spaine.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>These words, these deeds become thy person wel.</line>
<line>But now, knight-marhsall, frolike with thy king,</line>
<line>For tis thy sonne that winnes this battels prize.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Hiero.</speaker>
<line>Long may he liue to serue my soueraigne liege!</line>
<line>And soone decay unless he serue my liege!</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>A [trumpet] a-farre off.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>Nor thou nor he shall dye without reward.</line>
<line>What meanes this warning of this trumpets sound?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Gen.</speaker>
<line>This tels me that your Graces men of warre,</line>
<line>Such as warres fortune hath reseru'd from death,</line>
<line>Come marching on towards your royall seate,</line>
<line>To show themselues before your Maiestie;</line>
<line>For so gaue I in charge at my depart.</line>
<line>Whereby by demonstration shall appeare</line>
<line>That all, except three hundred or few more,</line>
<line>Are safe returnd and by their foes inricht.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>The armie enters, BALTHAZAR betweene LORENZO</stagedir>

<stagedir>and HORATIO, captiue.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>A gladsome sight! I long to see them heere.</line>
<stagedir>They enter and passe by.</stagedir>
<line>Was that the warlike prince of Portingale</line>
<line>That by our nephew was in triumph led?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Gen.</speaker>
<line>It was, my liege, the prince of Portingale.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>But what was he that on the other side</line>
<line>Held him by th' arme as partner of the prize?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Hiero.</speaker>
<line>That was my sonne, my gracious soueraigne;</line>
<line>Of whome though from his tender infancie</line>
<line>My louing thoughts did neuer hope but well,</line>
<line>He neuer pleasd his fathers eyes till now,</line>
<line>Nor fild my hart with ouercloying ioyes.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>Goe, let them march once more about these walles,</line>
<line>That staying them we may conferre and talke</line>
<line>With our braue prisoner and his double guard.</line>

<stagedir>[Exit a MESSENGER.]</stagedir>
<line>Hieoronimo, it greatly pleaseth vs</line>
<line>That in our victorie thou haue a share</line>
<line>By vertue of thy worthy sonnes exploit.</line>

<stagedir>Enter againe.</stagedir>
<line>Bring hether the young prince of Portingale!</line>
<line>The rest martch on, but, ere they be dismist,</line>
<line>We will bestow on euery soldier</line>
<line>Two duckets, and on euery leader ten,</line>
<line>That they may know our largesse welcomes them.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exeunt all [the army] but BAL[THAZAR],</stagedir>

<stagedir>LOR[ENZO], and HOR[ATIO].</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>[KING.]</speaker>
<line>Welcome, Don Balthazar! Welcome nephew!</line>
<line>And thou, Horatio, thou art welcome too!</line>
<line>Young prince, although thy fathers hard misdeedes</line>
<line>In keeping backe the tribute that he owes</line>
<line>Deserue but euill measure at our hands,</line>
<line>Yet shalt thou know that Spaine is honorable.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Balt.</speaker>
<line>The trespasse that my father made in peace</line>
<line>Is now controlde by fortune of the warres;</line>
<line>And cards once dealt, it bootes not aske why so.</line>
<line>His men are slaine,&#8212;a weakening to his realme;</line>
<line>His colours ceaz'd,&#8212;a blot vnto his name;</line>
<line>His sonne distrest,&#8212;a corsiue to his hart;</line>
<line>These punishments may cleare his late offence.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>I, Balthazar, if he obserue this truce,</line>
<line>Our peace will grow the stronger for these warres.</line>
<line>Meane-while liue thou, though not in libertie,</line>
<line>Yet free from bearing any seruile yoake;</line>
<line>For in our hearing thy deserts were great.</line>
<line>And in our sight thy-selfe art gratious.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Balt.</speaker>
<line>And I shall studie to deserue this grace.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>But tell me,&#8212;for their holding makes me doubt:</line>
<line>To Which of these twaine art thou prisoner?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Lor.</speaker>
<line>To me, my liege.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Hor.</speaker>
<line>To me, my soueraigne.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Lor.</speaker>
<line>This hand first tooke his courser by the raines.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Hor.</speaker>
<line>But first my launce did put him from his horse.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Lor.</speaker>
<line>I ceaz'd the weapon and enioyde it first.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Hor.</speaker>
<line>But first I forc'd him lay his weapons downe.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>Let goe his arm, vpon my priviledge!</line>
<line>Let him goe.</line>
<line>Say, worthy prince: to whether didst thou yeeld?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Balt.</speaker>
<line>To him in curtesie; to this perforce;</line>
<line>He spake me faire, this other gaue me strokes;</line>
<line>He promisde life, this other threatned death;</line>
<line>He wan my loue, this other conquerd me;</line>
<line>And, truth to say, I yeeld my-selfe to both.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Hiero.</speaker>
<line>But that I [know] your Grace is iust and wise,</line>
<line>And might seeme partiall in this difference,</line>
<line>Inforct by nature and by law of armes,</line>
<line>My tongue should plead for young Horatios right.</line>
<line>He hunted well that was a lyons death,</line>
<line>Not he that in a garment wore his skin;</line>
<line>So hares may pull dead lyons by the beard.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>Content thee, marshall; thou shalt haue no wrong,</line>
<line>And for thy sake thy sonne shall want to right.</line>
<line>Will both abide the censure of my doome?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Lor.</speaker>
<line>I craue no better than your Grace awards.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Hor.</speaker>
<line>Nor I, although I sit beside my right.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>Then by iudgement thus your strife shall end:</line>
<line>You both deserue and both shall haue reward.</line>
<line>Nephew, thou tookst his weapon[s] and his horse:</line>
<line>His weapons and his horse are thy reward.</line>
<line>Horatio, thou didst force him first to yeeld:</line>
<line>His ransome therefore is thy valours fee;</line>
<line>Appoint the sum as you shall both agree.</line>
<line>But, nephew, thou shalt haue the prince in guard,</line>
<line>For thine estate best fitteth such a guest;</line>
<line>Horatios house were small for all his traine.</line>
<line>Yet, in regard they substance passeth his,</line>
<line>And that iust guerdon may befall desert,</line>
<line>To him we yeeld the armour of the prince.</line>
<line>How likes don Balthazar of this deuice?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Balt.</speaker>
<line>Right well, my liege, if this prouizo were:</line>
<line>That Don Horatio beare vs company,</line>
<line>Whome I admire and loue for chiualrie.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>Horatio, leaue him not that loues thee so.</line>
<line>Now let vs hence, to see our souldiers paide,</line>
<line>And feast our prisoner as our friendly guest.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exeunt.</stagedir>

<line>Then rest we heere a-while in our vnrest;</line>

<line>For deepest cares break neuer into teares.</line>
<line>But wherefore sit I in a regall throne?</line>
<line>This better fits a wretches endles moane.</line>
<line>Yet this is higher then my fortunes reach,</line>
<line>And therefore better then my state deserues.</line>
<stagedir>Falles to the grounde.</stagedir>
<line>I, I, this earth, image of melancholly,</line>

<line>Heere, take it now; let Fortune doe her worst,</line>
<line>She shall now rob me of this sable weed.</line>
<line>O, no, she enuies none but pleasent things.</line>
<line>Such is the folly of despightfull chance,</line>
<line>Fortune is blinde and sees not my deserts,</line>
<line>So is she deafe and heares not my laments;</line>
<line>And, coulde she heare, yet is she willfull mad,</line>
<line>And therefore will not pittie my distresse.</line>
<line>Suppose that she coulde pittie me, what then?</line>
<line>What helpe can be expected at her hands</line>
<line>Whose foote is standing on a rowling stone</line>
<line>And minde more mutable then fickle windes?</line>
<line>Why waile I, then, wheres hope of no redresse?</line>
<line>O, yes, complaining makes my greefe seeme lesse.</line>
<line>My late ambition hath distaind my faith,</line>

<line>My best beloued, my sweet and onely sonne!</line>
<line>O, wherefore went I not to warre my-selfe?</line>
<line>The cause was mine; I might haue died for both.</line>
<line>My yeeres were mellow, but his young and greene:</line>

<speaker>Villup.</speaker>
<line>Then heare that truth which these mine eies have seene:</line>
<line>When both the armies were in battell ioyned.</line>
<line>Don Balthazar amidst the thickest troupes,</line>
<line>To winne renowme, did wondrous feats of armes;</line>
<line>Amongst the rest I saw him hand-to-hand</line>
<line>In single fight with their lord generall.</line>
<line>Till Alexandro, that heere counterfeits</line>
<line>Vnder the colour of a duteous freend,</line>
<line>Discharged a pistol at the princes back,</line>
<line>As though he would haue slaine their generall,</line>
<line>But therwithall Don Balthazar fell downe;</line>
<line>And when he fell, then we began to flie;</line>
<line>But, had he liued, the day had sure bene ours.</line>

<line>O wiched forgerie! O traiterous miscreant!</line>

<line>Hold thou thy peace! But now, Villuppo, say:</line>
<line>Where then became the carkasse of my sonne?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Villup.</speaker>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Vice.</speaker>
<line>I, I, my nightly dreames haue tolde me this!</line>
<line>Thou false, vnkinde, vnthankfull, traiterous beast!</line>
<line>Wherein had Balthazar offended thee,</line>
<line>That thou should betray him to our foes?</line>
<line>Wast Spanish golde that bleared so thine eyes</line>
<line>That thou couldst see no part of our deserts?</line>
<line>Perchance, because thou art Terseraes lord,</line>
<line>Thou hadst some hope to weare this diademe</line>
<line>If first my sonne and then my-selfe were slaine;</line>
<line>But thy ambitious thought shall breake thy neck.</line>
<line>I, this was it that made thee spill his bloud!</line>

<stagedir>Take the crowne and put it on againe.</stagedir>
<line>But Ile now weare it till they bloud be spilt.</line>

<speech>

<line>Vouchsafe, dread soueraigne, to heare me speak!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Vice.</speaker>
<line>Away with him! his sight is second hell!</line>
<line>Keepe him till we determine his death.</line>
<line>If Balthazar be dead, he shall not liue.</line>

<stagedir>Enter HORATIO and BEL-IMPERIA.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>Bel.</speaker>
<line>Signior Horatio, this is the place and houre</line>
<line>Wherein I must intreat thee to relate</line>
<line>The circumstance of Don Andreas death,</line>
<line>Who liuing was my garlands sweetest flower,</line>
<line>And in his death hath buried my delights.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Hor.</speaker>
<line>For loue of him and seruice to yourself,</line>
<line>[Ile not] refuse this heauy dolefull charge;</line>
<line>Yet teares and sighes, I feare, will hinder me.</line>
<line>When both our armies were enioynd in fight,</line>
<line>Your worthie chiualier admist the thikst,</line>
<line>For glorious cause still aiming at the fairest,</line>
<line>Was at the last by yong Don Balthazar</line>
<line>Encountered hand-to-hand.</line>
<line>Their fight was long,</line>
<line>Their harts were great, their clamours menacing,</line>
<line>Their strength alike, their strokes both dangerous;</line>
<line>But wrathfull Nemesis, that wicked power,</line>
<line>Enuying at Andreas praise and worth,</line>
<line>Cut short his life to end his praise and woorth.</line>
<line>She, she her-selfe, disguisde in armours maske,</line>
<line>As Pallas was before proud Pergamus,</line>
<line>Brought in a fresh supply of halberdiers,</line>
<line>Which pauncht his horse and dingd him to the ground.</line>
<line>Then yong Don Balthazar, with ruthles rage,</line>
<line>Taking aduantage of his foes distresse,</line>
<line>Did finish what his halberdiers begun;</line>
<line>And left not till Andreas life was done.</line>
<line>Then, though too late, incenst with iust remorce,</line>
<line>I with my band set foorth against the prince,</line>
<line>And brought him prisoner from his halba[r]diers.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Bel.</speaker>
<line>Would thou hadst slaine him that so slew my loue!</line>
<line>But then was Don Andreas carkasse lost?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Hor.</speaker>
<line>No; that was it for which I cheefely stroue,</line>
<line>Nor stept I back till I recouerd him.</line>
<line>I tooke him vp, and wound him in mine armes,</line>
<line>And, welding him vnto my priuate tent,</line>
<line>There laid him downe and dewd him with my teares,</line>
<line>And sighed and sorrowed as became a freend.</line>
<line>But neither freendly sorrow, sighes and teares</line>
<line>Could win pale Death from his vsurped right.</line>
<line>Yet this I did, and lesse I could not doe:</line>
<line>I saw him honoured with due funerall.</line>
<line>This scarfe I pluckt from off his liueles arme,</line>
<line>And wear it in remembrance of my freend.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Bel.</speaker>
<line>I know the scarfe: would he had kept it still!</line>
<line>For, had he liued, he would haue kept it still,</line>
<line>And worne it for his Bel-imperias sake;</line>
<line>For twas my fauour at his last depart.</line>
<line>But now weare thou it both for him and me;</line>
<line>For, after him, thou hast deserued it best.</line>
<line>But, for thy kindnes in his life and death,</line>
<line>Be sure, while Bel-imperias life endures,</line>
<line>She will be Don Horatios thankfull freend.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Hor.</speaker>
<line>And, madame, Don Horatio will not slacke</line>
<line>Humbly to serue faire Bel-imperia.</line>
<line>But now, if your good liking stand thereto,</line>
<line>Ile craue your pardon to goe seeke the prince;</line>
<line>For so the duke, your father, gaue me charge.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>Bel.</speaker>
<line>I, goe, Horatio; leaue me heere alone,</line>
<line>For solitude best fits my cheereles mood.&#8212;</line>
<line>Yet what auailes to waile Andreas death,</line>
<line>From whence Horatio proues my second loue?</line>
<line>Had he not loued Andrea as he did,</line>
<line>He could not sit in Bel-imperias thoughts.</line>
<line>But how can loue finde harbour in my brest,</line>
<line>Till I reuenge the death of my beloued?</line>
<line>Yes, second loue shall further my reuenge:</line>
<line>Ile loue Horatio, my Andreas freend,</line>
<line>The more to spight the prince that wrought his end;</line>
<line>And, where Don Balthazar, that slew my loue,</line>
<line>He shall, in rigour of my iust disdaine,</line>
<line>Reape long repentance for his murderous deed,&#8212;</line>
<line>For what wast els but murderous cowardise,</line>
<line>So many to oppresse one valiant knight,</line>
<line>Without respect of honour in the fight?</line>
<line>And heere he comes that murdred my delight.</line>

<line>The king, my lords, is comming hither straight</line>
<line>To feast the Portingall embassadour;</line>
<line>Things were in readiness before I came.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Bal.</speaker>
<line>Then heere it fits vs to attend the king,</line>
<line>To welcome hither our embassadour,</line>
<line>And learne my father and my countries health.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter the banquet, TRUMPETS, the KING,</stagedir>

<stagedir>and EMBASSADOUR.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>See, lord embassador, how Spaine intreats</line>
<line>Their prisoner Balthazar, thy viceroyes sonne:</line>
<line>We pleasure more in kindenes than in warres.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Embass.</speaker>
<line>Sad is our king, and Portingale laments,</line>
<line>Supposing that Don Balthazar is slaine.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Bal.</speaker>
<stagedir>[aside]</stagedir>
<line>So am I, slaine by beauties tirannie!&#8212;</line>
<line>You see, my lord, how Balthazar is slaine:</line>
<line>I frolike with the Duke of Castilles sonne,</line>
<line>Wrapt euery houre in pleasures of the court,</line>
<line>And graste with fauours of his Maiestie.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>Put off your greetings till our feast be done;</line>
<line>Now come and sit with vs, and taste our cheere.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Sit to the banquet.</stagedir>
<line>Sit downe, young prince, you are our second guest;</line>
<line>Brother, sit downe; and nephew, take your placel</line>
<line>Signior Horatio, waite thou vpon our cup,</line>
<line>For well thou hast deserued to be honored.</line>
<line>Now, lordings, fall too: Spaine is Portugall,</line>
<line>And Portugall is Spaine; we both are freends;</line>
<line>Tribute is paid, and we enioy our right.</line>
<line>But where is olde Hieronimo, our marhsall?</line>
<line>He promised vs, in honor of our guest,</line>
<line>To grace our banquet with some pompous iest.</line>

<stagedir>Enter HIERONIMO with a DRUM, three KNIGHTS,</stagedir>

<stagedir>each with scutchin; then he fethces three</stagedir>

<stagedir>KINGS; they take their crownes and them</stagedir>

<stagedir>captiue.</stagedir>
<line>Hieronimo, this makes contents mine eie,</line>
<line>Although I sound well not the misterie.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Hiero.</speaker>
<line>The first arm'd knight that hung his scutchin vp</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>He takes the scutchin ahd giues it to</stagedir>

<stagedir>the KING.</stagedir>
<line>Was English Robert, Earle of Glocester,</line>
<line>Who, when King Stephen bore sway in Albion,</line>
<line>Arriued with fiue and twenty thousand men</line>
<line>In Portingale, and, by successe of warre,</line>
<line>Enforced the king, then but a Sarasin,</line>
<line>To beare the yoake of the English monarchie.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>My lord of Portingale, by this you see</line>
<line>That which may comfort both your king and you,</line>
<line>And make your late discomfort seeme the lesse.</line>
<line>But say, Hieronimo: what was the next?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Hiero.</speaker>
<line>The second knight that hung his scutchin vp</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>He doth as he did before.</stagedir>
<line>Was Edmond, Earle of Kent in Albion.</line>
<line>When English Richard wore the diadem,</line>
<line>He came likewise and razed Lisbon walles,</line>
<line>And tooke the king of Portingale in fight,&#8212;</line>
<line>For which, and other suche seruice done,</line>
<line>He after was created Duke of Yorke.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>This is another speciall argument</line>
<line>That Portingale may daine to beare our yoake,</line>
<line>When it by little England hath beene yoakt.</line>
<line>But now, Hieronimo, what were the last?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Hiero.</speaker>
<line>The third and last, not least in our account,</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Dooing as before.</stagedir>
<line>Was, as the rest, a valiant Englishman,</line>
<line>Braue Iohn of Gaunt, the Duke of Lancaster,</line>
<line>As by his scuthcin plainely may appeare:</line>
<line>He with a puissant armie came to Spaine</line>
<line>And tooke our Kinge of Castille prisoner.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Embass.</speaker>
<line>This is an argument for our viceroy</line>
<line>That Spaine may not insult for her successe,</line>
<line>Since English warriours likewise conquered Spaine</line>
<line>And made them bow their knees to Albion.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>Hieronimo, I drinke to thee for this deuice,</line>
<line>Which hath pleasde both the embassador and me:</line>
<line>Pledge me, Hieronimo, if thou loue the king!</line>

<stagedir>Takes the cup of HORATIO.</stagedir>
<line>My lord, I feare we sit but ouer-long,</line>
<line>Vnlesse our dainties were more delicate,&#8212;</line>
<line>But welcome are to you the best we haue.</line>
<line>Now let vs in, that you may be dispatcht;</line>
<line>I think our councell is already set.</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Reuenge.</speaker>
<line>Be still, Andrea; ere we go from hence,</line>
<line>Ile turne their freendship into fell despight,</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Lorenzo.</speaker>
<line>My lord, though Bel-imperia seeme thus coy,</line>
<line>Let reason holde you in your wonted ioy:</line>
<line>In time the sauage bull sustaines the yoake,</line>
<line>In time all haggard hawkes will stoope to lure,</line>
<line>In time small wedges cleaue the hardest oake,</line>
<line>In time the [hardest] flint is pearst with softest shower;</line>
<line>And she in time will fall from her disdaine,</line>
<line>And rue the sufferance of your freendly paine.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Bal.</speaker>
<line>No; she is wilder, and more hard withall,</line>
<line>Then beast or bird, or tree or stony wall!</line>
<line>But wherefore blot I Bel-imperias name?</line>
<line>It is my fault, not she that merits blame.</line>
<line>My feature is not to content her sight;</line>
<line>My wordes are rude and worke her no delight;</line>
<line>The lines I send her are but harsh and ill,</line>
<line>Such as doe drop from Pan and Marsias quill;</line>
<line>My presents are not of sufficient cost;</line>
<line>And, being worthles, all my labours lost.</line>
<line>Yet might she loue me for my valiancie.</line>
<line>I; but thats slandred by captiuitie.</line>
<line>Yet might she loue me to content her sire.</line>
<line>I; but her reason masters [her] desire.</line>
<line>Yet might she loue me as her brothers freend.</line>
<line>I; but her hopes aime at some other end.</line>
<line>Yet might she loue me to vpreare her state.</line>
<line>I; but perhaps she [loues] some nobler mate.</line>
<line>Yet might she loue me as her beauties thrall.</line>
<line>I; but I feare she cannot loue at all.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Lor.</speaker>
<line>My lord, for my sake leaue these extasies,</line>
<line>And doubt not but weele finde some remedie.</line>
<line>Some cause there is that lets you not be loued:</line>
<line>First that must needs be knowne, and then remoued.</line>
<line>What if my sister loue some other knight?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Bal.</speaker>
<line>My sommers day will turne to winters night.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Lor.</speaker>
<line>I haue already founde a strategeme</line>
<line>To sound the bottome of this doubtfull theame.</line>
<line>My lord, for once you shall be rulde by me;</line>
<line>Hinder me not what ere you heare or see:</line>
<line>By force or faire meanes will I cast about</line>
<line>To finde the truth of all this question out.</line>
<line>Ho, Pedringano!</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Lor.</speaker>
<line>I, Pedringano, seruice of import.</line>
<line>And, not to spend the time in trifling words,</line>
<line>Thus stands the case: it is not long, thou knowst,</line>
<line>Since I did shield thee from my fathers wrath</line>
<line>For thy conueniance in Andreas love,</line>
<line>For which thou wert adiudg'd to punishment;</line>
<line>I stood betwixt thee and thy punishment,</line>
<line>And since thou knowest how I haue favored thee.</line>
<line>Now to these fauours will I adde reward,</line>
<line>Not with faire woords, but store of golden coyne</line>
<line>And lands and liuing ioynd with dignities,</line>
<line>If thou but satisfie my iust demaund;</line>
<line>Tell truth and haue me for thy lasting freend.</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Ped.</speaker>
<line>Alas, my lord, since Don Andreas death</line>
<line>I haue no credit with her as before,</line>
<line>And therefore know not if she loue or no.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Lor.</speaker>
<line>Nay, if thou dally, then I am thy foe,</line>
<line>And feare shall force what frendship cannot winne.</line>
<line>Thy death shall bury what thy life conceales.</line>
<line>Thou dyest for more esteeming her than me!</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Ped.</speaker>
<line>Oh stay, my lord!</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Lor.</speaker>
<line>Yet speak the truth, and I will guerdon thee</line>

<line>She sent him letters,&#8212;which my-selfe perusde,&#8212;</line>

<speaker>Ped.</speaker>
<line>What I haue saide is true, and shall, for me,</line>
<line>Be still conceald from Bel-imperia.</line>
<line>Besides, your Honors liberalitie</line>
<line>Deserues my duteous seruice euen till death.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Lor.</speaker>
<line>Let this be all that thou shall doe for me:</line>
<line>Be watchfull when and where these louers meete,</line>

<line>I will, my lord.</line>

<line>How likes Prince Balthazar this strategeme?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Bal.</speaker>
<line>Both well and ill; it makes me glad and sad:</line>
<line>Glad, that I know the hinderer of my loue;</line>
<line>Sad, that I fear she hates me whome I loue;</line>
<line>Glad, that I know on whome to be reueng'd;</line>
<line>Sad, that sheele flie me if I take reuenge.</line>
<line>Yet must I take reuenge or dye my-selfe;</line>
<line>For loue resisted growes impatient.</line>
<line>I think Horatio be my destind plague:</line>
<line>First, in his hand he brandished a sword,</line>
<line>And with that sword he fiercely waged warre,</line>
<line>And in that warre he gaue me dangerous wounds,</line>
<line>And by those wounds he forced me to yeeld,</line>
<line>And by my yeelding I became his slaue;</line>
<line>Now, in his mouth he carries pleasing words,</line>
<line>Which pleasing wordes doe harbour sweet conceits,</line>
<line>Which sweet conceits are lim'd with slie deceits,</line>
<line>Which slie deceits smooth Bel-imperias eares,</line>
<line>And through her eares diue downe into her hart,</line>
<line>And in her hart set him, where I should stand.</line>
<line>Thus hath he tane my body by force,</line>
<line>And now by sleight would captiuate my soule;</line>
<line>But in his fall Ile tempt the Destinies,</line>
<line>And either loose my life or winne my loue.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Lor.</speaker>

<speech>
<speaker>[Boy.]</speaker>
<line>My maister hath forbidden me to look in this box, and, by
my troth, tis likely, if he had not warned me, I should not haue had so
much idle time; for wee [men-kinde] in our minoritie are like women in
their vncertaintie; that they are most forbidden, they wil soonest
attempt; so I now.</line>
<line>By my bare honesty, heeres nothing but the bare
emptie box! Were it not sin against secrecie, I would say it were a
peece of gentlemanlike knauery.</line>
<line>I must goe to Pedringano and tell him
his pardon is in this boxe! Nay, I would haue sworne it, had I not
seene the contrary.</line>
<line>I cannot choose but smile to thinke how the villain
wil flout the gallowes, scorne the audience, and descant on the hangman,
and all presuming of his pardon from hence.</line>
<line>Wilt not be an odde iest,
for me to stand and grace euery iest he makes, pointing my figner at
this boxe, as who [should] say: "Mock on, heers thy warrant!" Ist not
a scuruie iest that a man should iest himselfe to death? Alas, poor
Pedringano! I am in a sorte sorie for thee, but, if I should be hanged
with thee, I [could not] weep.</line>

<line>The blustring winds, conspiring with my words,</line>
<line>At my lament haue moued to leaueless trees,</line>
<line>Disroabde the medowes of their flowred greene,</line>
<line>Made mountains marsh with spring-tides of my teares,</line>

<line>With broken sighes and restles passions,</line>
<line>That, winged, mount, and houering in the aire,</line>
<line>Beat at the windowes of the brightest heauens,</line>

<line>That such a monstrous and detested deed,</line>
<line>So closely smootherd and so long conceald,</line>

[The following is inserted in the 1618, 1623, and 1633 editions.]

<speech>
<speaker>Hier.</speaker>
<line>Tis neither as you thinke, nor as you thinke,</line>
<line>Nor as you thinke, you'r wide all:</line>
<line>These slippers are not mine, they were my sonne Horatios.</line>
<line>My sonne? And what's a sonne? A thing begot</line>
<line>Within a paire of minutes, there-about;</line>
<line>A lump bred up in darknesse, and doth serue</line>
<line>To ballance those light creatures we call women,</line>
<line>And at nine monethes end creepes foorth to light.</line>
<line>What is there yet in a sonne to make a father</line>
<line>Dote, rave or runne mad? Being born, it pouts,</line>
<line>Cries, and breeds teeth.</line> 
<line>What is there yet in a sonne?</line>
<line>He must be fed, be taught to goe and speake.</line>
<line>I, and yet? Why might not a man love</line>
<line>A calfe as well, or melt in passion over</line>
<line>A frisking kid, as for a sonne? Me thinkes</line>
<line>A young bacon or a fine smooth little horse-colt</line>
<line>Should moove a man as much as doth a son;</line>
<line>For one of these in very little time</line>
<line>Will grow to some good use, whereas a sonne,</line>
<line>The more he growes in stature and in yeeres,</line>
<line>The more unsquar'd, unlevelled he appeares,</line>
<line>Reckons his parents among the ranke of fooles,</line>
<line>Strikes cares upon their heads with his mad ryots,</line>
<line>Makes them looke old before they meet with age.&#8212;</line>
<line>This is a son! And what a losse were this,</line>
<line>Considered truely! Oh, but my Horatio</line>
<line>Grew out of reach of those insatiate humours:</line>
<line>He lovd his loving parents, he was my comfort</line>
<line>And his mothers joy, the very arme that did</line>
<line>Hold up our house, our hopes were stored up in him.</line>
<line>None but a damned murderer could hate him!</line>
<line>He had not seene the backe</line>
<line>Of nineteene yeere, when his strong arme unhorst</line>
<line>The proud prince Balthazar; and his great minde,</line>
<line>Too full of honour tooke him unto mercy,</line>
<line>That valient but ignoble Portingale.</line>
<line>Well! Heaven is Heaven still! And there's Nemesis, and Furies,</line>
<line>And things called whippes, and they sometimes doe meet</line>
<line>With murderers! They doe not alwayes scape,&#8212;</line>
<line>That is some comfort! I, I, I; and then</line>
<line>Time steales on, and steales and steales, till violence</line>
<line>Leapes foorth like thunder wrapt in a ball of fire,</line>
<line>And so doth bring confusion to them all.</line>

<line>Then stay, Hieronimo, attend their will;</line>
<line>For mortall men may not appoint their time.</line>
<line>Per scelus semper tutum est sceleribus iter:</line>
<line>Strike, and strike home, where wrong is offred thee;</line>
<line>For euils vnto ils conductors be,</line>

<line>Wise men will take their opportunitie,</line>
<line>Closely and safely fitting things to time;</line>

<line>Lorenzo, shouldst thou thwart his passions,</line>

<line>Tell me,&#8212;and loke thou tell me truely too,&#8212;</line>
<line>Whence growes the ground of this report in court?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Lor.</speaker>
<line>My l[ord], it lyes not in Lorenzos power</line>

<line>Be not a history to after times</line>
<line>Of such ingratitude vnto thy sonne!</line>
<line>Vnhappy mothers of such chldren then!</line>
<line>But monstrous fathers, to forget so soone</line>
<line>The death of those whom they with care and cost</line>
<line>Haue tendred so, thus careles should be lost!</line>
<line>My-selfe, a stranger in respect to thee,</line>
<line>So loued his life as still I wish their deathes.</line>
<line>Nor shall his death be vnreuengd by me.</line>
<line>Although I beare it out for fashions sake;</line>
<line>For heere I sweare in sight of heauen and earth,</line>
<line>Shouldst thou neglect the loue thou shoudlst retain</line>
<line>And giue ouer and deuise no more,</line>
<line>My-selfe should send their hatefull soules to hel</line>
<line>That wrought his downfall with extreamest death!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Hie.</speaker>
<line>But may it be that Bel-imperia</line>
<line>Vowes such reuenge as she hath dain'd to say?</line>
<line>Why then, I see that heauen applies our drift,</line>
<line>And all the saints doe sit soliciting</line>
<line>For vengeance on those cursed murtherers.</line>
<line>Madame, tis true, and now I find it so.</line>
<line>I found a letter, written in your name,</line>
<line>And in that letter, how Horatio died.</line>
<line>Pardon, O pardon, Bel-imperia,</line>
<line>My feare and care in not beleeuing it!</line>
<line>Nor thinke I thoughtles thinke vpon a meane</line>
<line>To let his death be vnreuenge'd at full.</line>
<line>And heere I vow, so you but giue consent</line>
<line>And will conceale my resolution,</line>
<line>I will ere long determine of their deathes</line>
<line>That causeles thus haue murderd my sonne.</line>
</speech>

<speaker>Bel.</speaker>
<line>Hieronimo, I will consent, conceale,</line>
<line>And ought that may effect for thine auaile,</line>
<line>Ioyne with thee to reuenge Horatios death.</line>
</speech>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Bal.</speaker>
<line>What, would you haue vs play a tragedie?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Hiero.</speaker>

<line>To make experience of their wit in plaies!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Lor.</speaker>
<line>Nay, be not angry, good Hieronimo;</line>

<speaker>Hiero.</speaker>
<line>Now, my good lord, could you intreat,</line>
<line>Your sister, Bel-imperia, to make one,&#8212;</line>
<line>For whats a play without a woman in it?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Bel.</speaker>
<line>Little intreaty shall serue me, Hieronimo,</line>
<line>For I must needs be imployed in your play.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Hiero.</speaker>
<line>Why, this is well! I tell you, lordings,</line>
<line>It was determined to haue beene acted,</line>
<line>By gentlemen and schollers too,</line>
<line>Such as could tell what to speak.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Bal.</speaker>
<line>And now it shall be plaide by princes and courtiers,</line>
<line>Such as can tell how to speak,</line>
<line>If, as it is our country manner,</line>
<line>You will but let vs know the argument.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Hiero.</speaker>
<line>That shall I roundly.</line> 
<line>The cronicles of Spaine</line>
<line>Recorde this written of a knight of Rodes;</line>
<line>He was betrothed, and wedded at the length,</line>
<line>To one Perseda, an Italian dame,</line>
<line>Whose beatuie rauished all that her behelde,</line>
<line>Especially the soule of Soliman,</line>
<line>Who at the marriage was the cheefest guest.</line>
<line>By sundry meanes sought Soliman to winne</line>
<line>Persedas loue, and could not gaine the same.</line>
<line>Then gan he break his passions to a freend,</line>
<line>One of his bashawes whome he held full deere.</line>
<line>Her has this bashaw long solicited,</line>
<line>And saw she was not otherwise to be wonne</line>
<line>But by her husbands death, this knight of Rodes,</line>
<line>Whome presently by trecherie his slew.</line>
<line>She, stirde with an exceeding hate therefore,</line>
<line>As cause of this, slew [Sultan] Soliman,</line>
<line>And, to escape the bashawes tirannie,</line>
<line>Did stab her-selfe.</line> 
<line>And this [is] the tragedie.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Lor.</speaker>
<line>O, excellent!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Bel.</speaker>
<stagedir>But say, Hieronimo:</stagedir>
<line>What then became of him that was the bashaw?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Hiero.</speaker>
<line>Marrie thus: moued with remorse of his misdeeds,</line>
<line>Ran to a mountain top and hung himselfe.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Bal.</speaker>
<line>But which of vs is to performe that part?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Hiero.</speaker>
<line>O, that will I, my lords; make no doubt of it;</line>
<line>Ile play the murderer, I warrent you;</line>
<line>For I already haue conceited that.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Bal.</speaker>
<line>And what shall I?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Hiero.</speaker>
<line>Great Soliman, the Turkish emperour.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Lor.</speaker>
<line>And I?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Hiero.</speaker>
<line>Erastus, the knight of Rhodes.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Bel.</speaker>
<line>And I?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Hiero.</speaker>
<line>Perseda, chaste and resolute.</line>
<line>And heere, my lords, are seueral abstracts drawne,</line>
<line>For eache of you to note your [seuerall] partes.</line>
<line>And act it as occasion's offred you.</line>
<line>You must prouide [you with] a Turkish cappe,</line>
<line>A black moustache and a fauchion.</line>

<stagedir>Giues paper to BAL[THAZAR].</stagedir>
<line>You with a crosse, like a knight of Rhodes.</line>

<stagedir>Giues another to LOR[ENZO].</stagedir>
<line>And, madame, you must [then] attire your-selfe</line>

<stagedir>He giueth BEL[-IMPERIA] another.</stagedir>
<line>Like Phoebe, Flora, or the huntresse [Dian],</line>
<line>Which to your discretion shall seeme best.</line>
<line>And as for me, my lords, Ile looke to one,</line>
<line>And with the raunsome that the vice-roy sent</line>
<line>So furnish and performe this tragedie</line>
<line>As all the world shall say Hieronimo</line>
<line>Was liberall in gracing of it so.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Bal.</speaker>
<line>Hieronimo, me thinks a comedie were better.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Hiero.</speaker>
<line>A comedie? fie! comedies are fit for common wits;</line>
<line>But to present a kingly troupe withall,</line>
<line>Giue me a stately-written tragedie,&#8212;</line>
<line>Tragedia cothurnata, fitting kings,</line>
<line>Containing matter, and not common things!</line>
<line>My lords, all this [our sport] must be perfourmed,</line>
<line>As fitting, for the first nights reuelling.</line>
<line>The Italian tragedians were so sharpe</line>
<line>Of wit that in one houres meditation</line>
<line>They would performe any-thing in action.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Lor.</speaker>
<line>And well it may, for I haue seene the like</line>
<line>In Paris, mongst the French tragedians.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Hiero.</speaker>
<line>In Paris? mas, and well remembered!&#8212;</line>
<line>Theres one thing more that rests for vs to doo.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Bal.</speaker>
<line>Whats that, Hieronimo?</line>
<line>Forget not any-thing.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Hiero.</speaker>
<line>Each one of vs</line>
<line>Must act his parte in vnknowne languages,</line>
<line>That it may breede the more varietie:</line>
<line>As you, my lord, in Latin, I in Greeke,</line>
<line>You in Italian, and, for-because I know</line>
<line>That Bel-imperia hath practised the French,</line>
<line>In courtly French shall all her phrases be.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Bel.</speaker>
<line>You meane to try my cunning then, Hieronimo!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Bal.</speaker>
<line>But this will be a meere confusion,</line>
<line>And hardly shall we all be vnderstoode.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HEIRO.</speaker>
<line>It must be so; for the conclusion</line>
<line>Shall proue the inuention and all was good;</line>
<line>And I my-selfe in an oration,</line>
<line>That I will haue there behinde a curtaine,</line>
<line>And with a strange and wondrous shew besides,</line>
<line>Assure your-selfe, shall make the matter knowne.</line>
<line>And all shalbe concluded in once scene,</line>
<line>For theres no pleasure tane in tediousnes.</line>
</speech>

<line>How like you this?</line>

<line>Make haste, Hieronimo, to holde excusde</line>

<line>Ah, nay; thou dost delay their deaths,</line>

<line>Which seazd on my Erasto, harmelesse knight.</line>
<line>Yet by thy power thou thinkest to commaund,</line>
<line>And to thy power Perseda doth obey;</line>
<line>But, were she able, thus she would reuenge</line>
<line>Thy treacheries on thee, ignoble prince;</line>
<stagedir>Stab him.</stagedir>
<line>And on herselfe she would be thus reuengd.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Stab herselfe.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>Well said, old marshall! this was brauely done!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Hiero.</speaker>
<line>But Bel-imperia plauies Perseda well.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Vice.</speaker>
<line>Were this in earnest, Bel-imperia,</line>
<line>You would be better to my sonne then so.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>But now what followes for Hieronimo?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Hiero.</speaker>
<line>Marrie, this followes for Hieronimo!</line>
<line>Heere breake we off our sundrie languages,</line>
<line>And thus conclude I in our vulgare tung:</line>
<line>Happely you think&#8212;but bootles are your thoughts&#8212;</line>
<line>That this is fabulously counterfeit,</line>
<line>And that we doo as all trageians doo,&#8212;</line>
<line>To die to-day, for fashioning our scene,</line>
<line>The death of Aiax, or some Romaine peer,</line>
<line>And, in a minute starting vp againe,</line>
<line>Reuiue to please tomorrows audience.</line>
<line>No, princes; know I am Hieronimo,</line>
<line>The hopeles father of a haples sonne,</line>
<line>Whose tung is tun'd to tell his latest tale,</line>
<line>Not to excuse grosse errors in the play.</line>
<line>I see your lookes vrge instance of these words:</line>
<line>Beholde the reason vrging me to this!</line>

<stagedir>Showes his dead sonne.</stagedir>
<line>See heere my shew; look on this spectacle!</line>
<line>Heere lay my hope, and heere my hope hath end;</line>
<line>Heere lay my hart, and heere my hart was slaine;</line>
<line>Heere lay my treasure, heere my treasure lost;</line>
<line>Heere lay my blisse, and heere my blisse bereft.</line>
<line>But hope, hart, treasure, ioy and blisse,&#8212;</line>
<line>All fled, faild, died, yea, all decaide with this.</line>
<line>From froth these wounds came breath that gaue me life;</line>
<line>They murdred me that made these fatall markes.</line>
<line>The cause was loue whence grew this mortall hate:</line>
<line>The hate, Lorenzo and yong Balthazar;</line>
<line>The loue, my sonne to Bel-imperia.</line>
<line>But night, the couerer of accursed crimes,</line>
<line>With pitchie silence husht these traitors harmes,</line>
<line>And lent them leaue&#8212;for they had sorted leasure&#8212;</line>
<line>To take aduantage in my garden plot</line>
<line>Vpon my sonne, my deere Horatio.</line>
<line>There mercilesse they butcherd vp my boy,</line>
<line>In black, darke night, to pale, dim, cruell death!</line>
<line>He shrikes; I heard&#8212;and yet, me thinks, I heare&#8212;</line>
<line>His dismall out-cry eccho in the aire;</line>
<line>With soonest speed I hasted to the noise,</line>
<line>Where, hanging on a tree, I found my sonne</line>
<line>Through-girt with wounds and slaughtred, as you see.</line>
<line>And greeued I, think you, at this spectacle?</line>
<line>Speak, Portuguise, whose losse resembles mine!</line>
<line>If thou canst weep vpon thy Balthazar,</line>
<line>Tis like I wailde for my Horatio.</line>
<line>And you, my l[ord], whose reconciled sonne</line>
<line>Marcht in a net and thought himself vnseene,</line>
<line>And rated me for a brainsicke lunacie,</line>
<line>With "God amend that mad Hieronimo!"&#8212;</line>
<line>How can you brook our plaies catastrophe?</line>
<line>And heere beholde this bloudie hand-kercher,</line>
<line>Which at Horatios death weeping dipt</line>
<line>Within the riuer of his bleeding wounds!</line>
<line>It as propitious, see, I haue reserued,</line>
<line>And neuer hath it left my bloody hart,</line>
<line>Soliciting remembrance of my vow</line>
<line>With these, O these accursed murderers!</line>
<line>Which now perform'd, my hart is satisfied.</line>
<line>And to this end the bashaw I became,</line>
<line>That might reuenge me on Lorenzos life,</line>
<line>Who therefore was appointed to the part</line>
<line>And was to represent the knight of Rhodes,</line>
<line>That I might kill him more conueniently.</line>
<line>So, vice-roy, was this Balthazar thy sonne&#8212;</line>
<line>That Soliman which Bel-imperia</line>
<line>In person of Perseda murdered,&#8212;</line>
<line>So[le]lie appointed to that tragicke part,</line>
<line>That she might slay him that offended her.</line>
<line>Poore Bel-imperia mist her part in this:</line>
<line>For, though the story saith she should haue died,</line>
<line>Yet I, of kindenes and care for her,</line>
<line>Did otherwise determine of her end.</line>
<line>But loue of him whome they did hate too much</line>
<line>Did vrge her resolution to be such.</line>
<line>And princes, now beholde Hieronimo,</line>
<line>Author and actor in this tragedie,</line>
<line>Bearing his latest fortune in his fist;</line>
<line>And will as resolute conclude his parte</line>
<line>As any of the actors gone before.</line>
<line>And, gentles, thus I end my play!</line>
<line>Vrge no more words, I haue no more to say.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>He runs to hang himselfe.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>O hearken, vice-roy; holde Hieronimo!</line>
<line>Brother, my newphew and they sonne are slaine!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Vice.</speaker>
<line>We are betraide! my Balthazar is slaine!</line>
<line>Breake ope the doores; runne saue Hieronimo!</line>
<line>Hieronimo, doe but enforme the king of these euents;</line>
<line>Vpon mine honour, thou shalt haue no harme!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Hiero.</speaker>
<line>Vice-roy, I will not trust thee with my life,</line>
<line>Which I this day haue offered to my sonne:</line>
<line>Accursed wretch, why staiest thou him that was resolued to die?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>Speak, traitor! damned, bloudy murderer, speak!&#8212;</line>
<line>For, now I haue thee, I wil make thee speak!</line>
<line>Why hast thou done this vndeseruing deed?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Vice.</speaker>
<line>Why hast thou murdered my Balthazar?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Cas.</speaker>
<line>Why hast thou butchered both my children thus?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Hiero.</speaker>
<line>O good words! As deare to me was Horatio</line>
<line>As yours, or yours, my l[ord], to you.</line>
<line>My guitles sonne was by Lorenzo slaine;</line>
<line>And by Lorenzo and that Balthazar</line>
<line>Am I at last reuenged thorowly,&#8212;</line>
<line>Vpon whole soules may Heauens be yet auenged</line>
<line>With far greater far then these afflictions!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Cas.</speaker>
<line>But who were thy confederates in this?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Vice.</speaker>
<line>That was thy daughter Bel-imperia;</line>
<line>For by her hand my Balthazar was slaine,&#8212;</line>
<line>I saw her stab him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>Why speakest thou not?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Hiero.</speaker>
<line>What lesser libertie can kings affoord</line>
<line>Then harmles silence? That afford it me!</line>
<line>Sufficeth I may not nor I will not tell thee.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>Fetch forth the tortures! Traitor as thou art, Ile make thee tell!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Hiero.</speaker>
<stagedir>Indeed?</stagedir>
<line>Thou maiest torment me as his wretched sonne</line>
<line>Hath done in murdring my Horatio;</line>
<line>But neuer shalt thou force me to reueale</line>
<line>The thing which I haue vowed inviolate.</line>
<line>And therefore, in despight of all thy threats,</line>
<line>Pleasde with their deaths, and easde with their reuenge,</line>
<line>First take my tung, and afterwards my hart!</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>He bites out his tongue.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>O monstrous resolution of a wretch!</line>
<line>See, Vice-Roy, he hath bitten foorth his tung</line>
<line>Rather than reueale what we requirde.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Cas.</speaker>
<line>Yet can he write.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>And if in this he satisfie vs not,</line>
<line>We will deuise the 'xtreamest kinde of death</line>
<line>That euer was inuented for a wretch.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Then he makes signes for a knife to mend his pen.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>Cas.</speaker>
<line>O, he would haue a knife to mend his pen.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Vice.</speaker>
<line>Here; and aduise thee that thou write the troth,&#8212;</line>
<line>Look to my brother! saue Hieronimo!</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>He with a knife stabs the DUKE and himself.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>King.</speaker>
<line>What age hath euer heard such monstrous deeds?</line>
<line>My brother and the whole succeeding hope</line>
<line>That Spaine expected after my dicease.</line>
<line>Go beare his body hence, that we may mourne</line>
<line>The losse of our beloued brothers death,</line>
<line>That he may be entom'd, what-ere befall.</line>
<line>I am the next, the neerest, last of all.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Vice.</speaker>
<line>And thou, Don Pedro, do the like for vs:</line>
<line>Take vp our haples sonne vntimely slaine;</line>
<line>Set me vp with him, and he with wofull me,</line>
<line>Vpon the maine-mast of a ship vnmand,</line>
<line>And let the winde and tide [hale] me along</line>
<line>To Sillas barking and vntamed gulfe</line>
<line>Or to the lothsome poole of Archeron,</line>
<line>To weepe my want for my sweet Balthazar.</line>
<line>Spaine hath no refuge for a Portingale!</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>The trumpets sound a dead march, the KING OF SPAINE</stagedir>

<stagedir>mourning after his brothers body, and the KING OF</stagedir>

<stagedir>PORTINGALE bearing the body of his sonne.</stagedir>


<stagedir>Enter GHOAST and REUENGE.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>Ghoast.</speaker>
<line>I; now my hopes haue end in their effects,</line>
<line>When blood and sorrow finnish my desires:</line>
<line>Horatio murdered in his Fathers bower,</line>
<line>Vilde Serberine by Pedrigano slaine,</line>
<line>False Pedrigano hang'd by quaint deuice,</line>
<line>Faire Isabella by her-selfe misdone,</line>
<line>Prince Balthazar by Bel-imepria stabd,</line>
<line>The Duke of Castile an his wicked sonne</line>
<line>Both done to death by olde Hieronimo,</line>
<line>My Bel-imperia falne as Dido fell,</line>
<line>And good Hieronimo slaine by himselfe!</line>
<line>I, these were spectacles to please my soule.</line>
<line>Now will I beg at louely Proserpine</line>
<line>That, by the vertue of her princely doome,</line>
<line>I may consort my freends in pleasing sort,</line>
<line>And on my foes work iust and sharpe reuenge.</line>
<line>Ile lead my freend Horatio through those feeldes</line>
<line>Where neuer-dying warres are still inurde;</line>
<line>Ile lead faire Isabella to that traine</line>
<line>Where pittie weepes but neuer feeleth paine;</line>
<line>Ile lead my Bel-imperia to those ioyes</line>
<line>That vestal virgins and faire queenes possess;</line>
<line>Ile lead Hieronimo where Orpheus plaies,</line>
<line>Adding sweet pleasure to eternall daies.</line>
<line>But say, Reuenge,&#8212;for thou must helpe or none,&#8212;</line>
<line>Against the rest how shall my hate be showne?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Reuenge.</speaker>
<line>This hand shall hale them down to deepest hell,</line>
<line>Where none but furies, bugs and tortures dwell.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Ghoast.</speaker>
<line>Then, sweet Reuenge, doo this at my request:</line>
<line>Let me iudge and doome them to vnrest;</line>
<line>Let loose poore Titius from the vultures gripe,</line>
<line>And let Don Ciprian supply his roome;</line>
<line>Place Don Lorenzo on Ixions wheele,</line>
<line>And let the louers endles paines surcease,</line>
<line>Iuno forget olde wrath and graunt him ease;</line>
<line>Hang Balthazar about Chimeras neck,</line>
<line>And let him there bewaile his bloudy loue,</line>
<line>Repining at our ioyes that are aboue;</line>
<line>Let Serberine goe roule the fatall stone</line>
<line>And take from Siciphus his endles mone;</line>
<line>False Pedringano, for his trecherie,</line>
<line>Let him be dragde through boyling Acheron,</line>
<line>And there liue dying still in endles flames,</line>
<line>Blaspheming gods and all their holy names.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Reuenge.</speaker>
<line>Then haste we downe to meet thy freends and foes;</line>
<line>To place thy freends in ease, the rest in woes.</line>
<line>For heere though death [doth] end their miserie,</line>
<line>Ile there begin their endles tragedie.</line>
