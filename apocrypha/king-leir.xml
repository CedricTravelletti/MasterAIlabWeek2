<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>Thus to our grief the obsequies performed</line>
<line>Of our (too late) deceased and dearest queen,</line>
<line>Whose soul I hope, possessed of heavenly joys,</line>
<line>Doth ride in triumph amongst the cherubins;</line>
<line>Let us request your grave advice, my lords,</line>
<line>For the disposing of our princely daughters,</line>
<line>For whom our care is specially employed,</line>
<line>As nature bindeth to advance their states,</line>
<line>In royal marriage with some princely mates:</line>
<line>For wanting now their mother's good advice,</line>
<line>Under whose government they have received</line>
<line>A perfect pattern of a virtuous life:</line>
<line>Left as it were a ship without a stern,</line>
<line>Or silly sheep without a pastor's care:</line>
<line>Although ourselves do dearly tender them,</line>
<line>Yet are we ignorant of their affairs:</line>
<line>For fathers best do know to govern sons;</line>
<line>But daughters' steps the mother's counsel turns.</line>
<line>A son we want for to succeed our crown,</line>
<line>And course of time hath cancelled the date</line>
<line>Of further issue from our withered loins:</line>
<line>One foot already hangeth in the grave,</line>
<line>And age hath made deep furrows in my face:</line>
<line>The world of me, I of the world am weary,</line>
<line>And I would fain resign these earthly cares,</line>
<line>And think upon the welfare of my soul:</line>
<line>Which by no better means may be effected,</line>
<line>Than by resigning up the crown from me,</line>
<line>In equal dowry to my daughters three.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SKALLIGER.</speaker>
<line>A worthy care, my liege, which well declares,</line>
<line>The zeal you bare unto our quondam queen:</line>
<line>And since your grace hath licensed me to speak,</line>
<line>I censure thus; your majesty knowing well,</line>
<line>What several suitors your princely daughters have,</line>
<line>To make them each a jointure more or less,</line>
<line>As is their worth, to them that love profess.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>No more, nor less, but even all alike,</line>
<line>My zeal is fixed, all fashioned in one mould:</line>
<line>Wherefore unpartial shall my censure be,</line>
<line>Both old and young shall have alike from me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NOBLEMAN.</speaker>
<line>My gracious lord, I heartily do wish,</line>
<line>That god had lent you an heir indubitate,</line>
<line>Which might have sat upon your royal throne,</line>
<line>When fates should loose the prison of your life,</line>
<line>By whose succession all this doubt might cease;</line>
<line>And as by you, by him we might have peace.</line>
<line>But after-wishes ever come too late,</line>
<line>And nothing can revoke the course of fate:</line>
<line>Wherefore, my liege, my censure deems it best,</line>
<line>To match them with some of your neighbour kings,</line>
<line>Bordering within the bounds of Albion,</line>
<line>By whose united friendship, this our state</line>
<line>May be protected against all foreign hate.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>Herein, my lords, your wishes sort with mine,</line>
<line>And mine (I hope) do sort with heavenly powers:</line>
<line>For at this instant two near neighbouring kings</line>
<line>Of Cornwall and of Cambria, motion love</line>
<line>To my two daughters, Gonorill and Ragan.</line>
<line>My youngest daughter, fair Cordella, vows</line>
<line>No liking to a monarch, unless love allows.</line>
<line>She is solicited by divers peers;</line>
<line>But none of them her partial fancy hears.</line>
<line>Yet, if my policy may her beguile,</line>
<line>I will match her to some king within this isle,</line>
<line>And so establish such a perfect peace,</line>
<line>As fortune's force shall never prevail to cease.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PERILLUS.</speaker>
<line>Of us and ours, your gracious care, my lord,</line>
<line>Deserves an everlasting memory,</line>
<line>To be enrolled in chronicles of fame,</line>
<line>By never-dying perpetuity:</line>
<line>Yet to become so provident a prince,</line>
<line>Lose not the title of a loving father:</line>
<line>Do not force love, where fancy cannot dwell,</line>
<line>Lest streams being stopped, above the banks do swell.</line>
</speech>


<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>I am resolved, and even now my mind</line>
<line>Doth meditate a sudden strategem,</line>
<line>To try which of my daughters loves me best:</line>
<line>Which till I know, I cannot be in rest.</line>
<line>This granted, when they jointly shall contend,</line>
<line>Each to exceed the other in their love:</line>
<line>Then at the vantage will I take Cordella,</line>
<line>Even as she doth protest she loves me best,</line>
<line>I will say, then, daughter, grant me one request,</line>
<line>To show thou lovest me as thy sisters do,</line>
<line>Accept a husband, whom myself will woo.</line>
<line>Although (poor soul) her senses will be mute:</line>
<line>Then will I triumph in my policy,</line>
<line>And match her with a king of Brittany.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SKALLIGER.</speaker>
<line>I will to them before, and bewray your secrecy.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PERILLUS.</speaker>
<line>Thus fathers think their children to beguile,</line>
<line>And oftentimes themselves do first repent,</line>
<line>When heavenly powers do frustrate their intent.</line>

<scenetitle>Scene II</scenetitle>

<stagedir>Enter Gonorill and Ragan.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>GONORILL.</speaker>
<line>I marvel, Ragan, how you can endure</line>
<line>To see that proud pert peat, our youngest sister,</line>
<line>So slightly to account of us, her elders,</line>
<line>As if we were no better than herself!</line>
<line>We cannot have a quaint device so soon,</line>
<line>Or new-made fashion, of our choice invention;</line>
<line>But if she like it, she will have the same,</line>
<line>Or study newer to exceed us both.</line>
<line>Besides, she is so nice and so demure;</line>
<line>So sober, courteous, modest, and precise,</line>
<line>That all the court hath work enough to do,</line>
<line>To talk how she exceedeth me and you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>RAGAN.</speaker>
<line>What should I do? would it were in my power,</line>
<line>To find a cure for this contagious ill:</line>
<line>Some desperate medicine must be soon applied,</line>
<line>To dim the glory of her mounting fame;</line>
<line>Else ere it be long, she will have both prick and praise,</line>
<line>And we must be set by for working days.</line>
<line>Do you not see what several choice of suitors</line>
<line>She daily hath, and of the best degree?</line>
<line>Say, amongst all, she hap to fancy one,</line>
<line>And have a husband whenas we have none:</line>
<line>Why then, by right, to her we must give place,</line>
<line>Though it be never so much to our disgrace.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GONORILL.</speaker>
<line>By my virginity, rather than</line>
<line>She shall have a husband before me,</line>
<line>I will marry one or other in his shirt:</line>
<line>And yet I have made half a grant already</line>
<line>Of my good-will unto the king of Cornwall.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>RAGAN.</speaker>
<line>Swear not so deeply, sister, here cometh my lord Skalliger:</line>
<line>Something his hasty coming doth import.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Skalliger</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>SKALLIGER.</speaker>
<line>Sweet princesses, I am glad I met you here so luckily,</line>
<line>Having good news which doth concern you both,</line>
<line>And craveth speedy expedition.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>RAGAN.</speaker>
<line>For god's sake tell us what it is, my lord,</line>
<line>I am with child until you utter it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SKALLIGER.</speaker>
<line>Madam, to save your longing, this it is:</line>
<line>Your father in great secrecy today,</line>
<line>Told me, he means to marry you out of hand,</line>
<line>Unto the noble prince of Cambria;</line>
<line>You, madam, to the king of Cornwall's grace:</line>
<line>Your younger sister he would fain bestow</line>
<line>Upon the rich king of Hibernia:</line>
<line>But that he doubts, she hardly will consent;</line>
<line>For hitherto she never could fancy him.</line>
<line>If she do yield, why then, between you three,</line>
<line>He will divide his kingdom for your dowries.</line>
<line>But yet there is a further mystery,</line>
<line>Which, so you will conceal, I will disclose.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GONORILL.</speaker>
<line>Whatever thou speakest to us, kind Skalliger,</line>
<line>Think that thou speakest it only to thyself.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SKALLIGER.</speaker>
<line>He earnestly desireth for to know,</line>
<line>Which of you three do bear most love to him,</line>
<line>And on your loves he so extremely dotes,</line>
<line>As never any did, I think, before.</line>
<line>As presently doth mean to send for you,</line>
<line>To be resolved of this tormenting doubt:</line>
<line>And look, whose answer pleaseth him the best,</line>
<line>They shall have most unto their marriages.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>RAGAN.</speaker>
<line>O that I had some pleasing mermaid's voice,</line>
<line>For to enchant his senseless senses with!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SKALLIGER.</speaker>
<line>For he supposeth that Cordella will</line>
<line>Striving to go beyond you in her love,</line>
<line>Promise to do whatever he desires:</line>
<line>Then will he straight enjoin her for his sake,</line>
<line>The hibernian king in marriage for to take.</line>
<line>This is the sum of all I have to say;</line>
<line>Which being done, I humbly take my leave,</line>
<line>Not doubting but your wisdoms will foresee</line>
<line>What course will best unto your good agree.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GONORILL.</speaker>
<line>Thanks, gentle Skalliger, thy kindness undeserved</line>
<line>Shall not be unrequited if we live.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit Skalliger</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>RAGAN.</speaker>
<line>Now have we fit occasion offered us,</line>
<line>To be revenged upon her unperceived.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GONORILL.</speaker>
<line>Nay, our revenge we will inflict on her</line>
<line>Shall be accounted piety in us:</line>
<line>I will so flatter with my doting father,</line>
<line>As he was never so flattered in his life.</line>
<line>Nay, I will say, that if it be his pleasure,</line>
<line>To match me to a beggar, I will yield:</line>
<line>For why, I know whatever I do say,</line>
<line>He means to match me with the Cornwall king.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>RAGAN.</speaker>
<line>I will say the like: for I am well assured,</line>
<line>Whatever I say to please the old man's mind,</line>
<line>Who dotes, as if he were a child again,</line>
<line>I shall enjoy the noble Cambrian prince:</line>
<line>Only, to feed his humour, will suffice,</line>
<line>To say, I am content with anyone</line>
<line>Whom he will appoint me; this will please him more,</line>
<line>Than ever Apollo's music pleased Jove.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GONORILL.</speaker>
<line>I smile to think, in what a woeful plight</line>
<line>Cordella will be, when we answer thus:</line>
<line>For she will rather die, than give consent</line>
<line>To join in marriage with the Irish king:</line>
<line>So will our father think, she loveth him not,</line>
<line>Because she will not grant to his desire,</line>
<line>Which we will aggravate in such bitter terms,</line>
<line>That he will soon convert his love to hate:</line>
<line>For he, you know, is always in extremes.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>RAGAN.</speaker>
<line>Not all the world could lay a better plot,</line>
<line>I long till it be put in practice.</line>

<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>Perillus, go seek my daughters,</line>
<line>Will them immediately come and speak with me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PERILLUS.</speaker>
<line>I will, my gracious lord.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>Oh, what a combat feels my panting heart,</line>
<line>Betwixt children's love, and care of common weal!</line>
<line>How dear my daughters are unto my soul,</line>
<line>None knows, but he, that knows my thoughts and secret deeds.</line>
<line>Ah, little do they know the dear regard,</line>
<line>Wherein I hold their future state to come:</line>
<line>When they securely sleep on beds of down,</line>
<line>These aged eyes do watch for their behalf:</line>
<line>While they like wantons sport in youthful toys,</line>
<line>This throbbing heart is pierced with dire annoys.</line>
<line>As doth the sun exceed the smallest star;</line>
<line>So much the father's love exceeds the child's.</line>
<line>Yet my complaints are causeless: for the world</line>
<line>Affords not children more conformable:</line>
<line>And yet, methinks, my mind presageth still</line>
<line>I know not what; and yet I fear some ill.</line>
<stagedir>Enter Perillus with the three daughters.</stagedir>
<line>Well, here my daughters come: I have found out</line>
<line>A present means to rid me of this doubt.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GONORILL.</speaker>
<line>Our royal lord and father, in all duty,</line>
<line>We come to know the tenour of your will,</line>
<line>Why you so hastily have sent for us.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>Dear Gonorill, kind Ragan, sweet Cordella,</line>
<line>Ye flourishing branches of a kingly stock,</line>
<line>Sprung from a tree that once did flourish green,</line>
<line>Whose blossoms now are nipped with winter's frost,</line>
<line>And pale grim death doth wait upon my steps,</line>
<line>And summons me unto his next assizes.</line>
<line>Therefore, dear daughters, as ye tender the safety</line>
<line>Of him that was the cause of your first being,</line>
<line>Resolve a doubt which much molests my mind,</line>
<line>Which of you three to me would prove most kind;</line>
<line>Which loves me most, and which at my request</line>
<line>Will soonest yield unto their father's hest.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GONORILL.</speaker>
<line>I hope, my gracious father makes no doubt</line>
<line>Of any of his daughters' love to him:</line>
<line>Yet for my part, to show my zeal to you,</line>
<line>Which cannot be in windy words rehearsed,</line>
<line>I prize my love to you at such a rate,</line>
<line>I think my life inferior to my love.</line>
<line>Should you enjoin me for to tie a millstone</line>
<line>About my neck, and leap into the sea,</line>
<line>At your command I willingly would do it:</line>
<line>Yea, for to do you good, I would ascend</line>
<line>The highest turret in all brittany,</line>
<line>And from the top leap headlong to the ground:</line>
<line>Nay, more should you appoint me for to marry</line>
<line>The meanest vassal in the spacious world,</line>
<line>Without reply I would accomplish it:</line>
<line>In brief, command whatever you desire,</line>
<line>And if I fail no favour I require.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>O, how my words revive my dying soul!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CORDELLA.</speaker>
<line>O, how I do abhor this flattery!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>But what saith Ragan to her father's will?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>RAGAN.</speaker>
<line>O, that my simple utterance could suffice,</line>
<line>To tell the true intention of my heart,</line>
<line>Which burns in zeal of duty to your grace,</line>
<line>And never can be quenched, but by desire</line>
<line>To show the same in outward forwardness.</line>
<line>Oh, that there were some other maid that durst</line>
<line>But make a challenge of her love with me;</line>
<line>I would make her soon confess she never loved</line>
<line>Her father half so well as I do you.</line>
<line>Ay then, my deeds should prove in plainer case,</line>
<line>How much my zeal aboundeth to your grace:</line>
<line>But for them all, let this one mean suffice,</line>
<line>To ratify my love before your eyes:</line>
<line>I have right noble suitors to my love,</line>
<line>No worse than kings, and haply I love one:</line>
<line>Yet, would you have me make my choice anew,</line>
<line>would bridle fancy, and be ruled by you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>Did never Philomel sing so sweet a note.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CORDELLA.</speaker>
<line>Did never flatterer tell so false a tale.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>Speak now, Cordella, make my joys at full,</line>
<line>And drop down nectar from thy honey lips.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CORDELLA.</speaker>
<line>I cannot paint my duty forth in words</line>
<line>I hope my deeds shall make report for me:</line>
<line>But look what love the child doth owe the father,</line>
<line>The same to you I bear, my gracious lord.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GONORILL.</speaker>
<line>Here is an answer answerless indeed:</line>
<line>Were you my daughter, I should scarcely brook it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>RAGAN.</speaker>
<line>Dost thou not blush, proud peacock as thou art,</line>
<line>To make our father such a slight reply?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>Why how now, minion, are you grown so proud?</line>
<line>Doth our dear love make you thus peremptory?</line>
<line>What, is your love become so small to us,</line>
<line>As that you scorn to tell us what it is?</line>
<line>Do you love us, as every child doth love</line>
<line>Their father? true indeed, as some,</line>
<line>Who by disobedience short their father's days,</line>
<line>And so would you; some are so father-sick,</line>
<line>That they make means to rid them from the world;</line>
<line>And so would you: some are indifferent,</line>
<line>Whether their aged parents live or die;</line>
<line>And so are you. but, didst thou know, proud girl,</line>
<line>What care I had to foster thee to this,</line>
<line>Ah, then thou wouldst say as thy sisters do:</line>
<line>Our life is less, than love we owe to you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CORDELLA.</speaker>
<line>Dear father, do not so mistake my words</line>
<line>Nor my plain meaning be misconstrued;</line>
<line>My tongue was never used to flattery.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GONORILL.</speaker>
<line>You were not best say I flatter: if you do,</line>
<line>My deeds shall show, I flatter not with you.</line>
<line>I love my father better than thou canst.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CORDELLA.</speaker>
<line>The praise were great, spoke from another's mouth:</line>
<line>But it should seem your neighbours dwell far off.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>RAGAN.</speaker>
<line>Nay, here is one, that will confirm as much</line>
<line>As she hath said, both for myself and her.</line>
<line>I say, thou dost not wish my father's good.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CORDELLA.</speaker>
<line>Dear father. ---</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>Peace, bastard imp, no issue of King Leir,</line>
<line>I will not hear thee speak one tittle more.</line>
<line>Call not me father, if thou love thy life,</line>
<line>Nor these thy sisters once presume to name:</line>
<line>Look for no help henceforth from me nor mine;</line>
<line>Shift as thou wilt, and trust unto thyself:</line>
<line>My kingdom will I equally divide</line>
<line>Betwixt thy two sisters to their royal dower,</line>
<line>And will bestow them worthy their deserts:</line>
<line>This done, because thou shalt not have the hope,</line>
<line>To have a child's part in the time to come,</line>
<line>I presently will dispossess myself,</line>
<line>And set up these upon my princely throne.</line>
<line>Gonorill. I ever thought that pride would have a fall.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>RAGAN.</speaker>
<line>Plain dealing, sister: your beauty is so sheen,</line>
<line>You need no dowry, to make you be a queen.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exeunt Leir, Gonorill, Ragan.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>CORDELLA.</speaker>
<line>Now whither, poor forsaken, shall I go,</line>
<line>When mine own sisters triumph in my woe?</line>
<line>But unto him which doth protect the just,</line>
<line>In him will poor Cordella put her trust.</line>
<line>These hands shall labour, for to get my spending;</line>
<line>And so I will live until my days have ending.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>PERILLUS.</speaker>
<line>Oh, how I grieve, to see my lord thus fond,</line>
<line>To dote so much upon vain flattering words.</line>
<line>Ah, if he but with good advice had weighed,</line>
<line>The hidden tenour of her humble speech,</line>
<line>Reason to rage should not have given place,</line>

<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<line>Dissuade me not, my lords, I am resolved,</line>
<line>This next fair wind to sail for Brittany,</line>
<line>In some disguise, to see if flying fame</line>

<line>Lord Mumford, you have saved me a labour,</line>

<line>So that you do not tie my tongue from speaking,</line>
<line>My lips from kissing when occasion serves,</line>
<line>My hands from congees, and my knees to bow</line>
<line>To gallant girls; which were a task more hard,</line>
<line>Than flesh and blood is able to endure:</line>
<line>Command what else you please, I rest content.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<line>To bind thee from a thing thou canst not leave,</line>
<line>Were but a means to make thee seek it more:</line>
<line>And therefore speak, look, kiss, salute for me;</line>
<line>In these myself am like to second thee.</line>
<line>Now hear thy task. I charge thee from the time</line>
<line>The first we set sail for the British shore,</line>
<line>To use no words of dignity to me,</line>
<line>But in the friendliest manner that thou canst,</line>
<line>Make use of me as thy companion:</line>
<line>For we will go disguised in palmers' weeds,</line>
<line>That no man shall mistrust us what we are.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MUMFORD.</speaker>
<line>If that be all, I will fit your turn, I warrant you. I am</line>
<line>some kin to the Blunts, and I think, the bluntest of all my kindred;</line>
<line>therefore if I be too blunt with you, thank yourself for praying me to be so.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<line>Thy pleasant company will make the way seem short.</line>
<line>It resteth now, that in my absence hence,</line>
<line>I do commit the government to you</line>
<line>My trusty lords and faithful counsellors.</line>
<line>Time cutteth off the rest I have to say:</line>
<line>The wind blows fair, and I must needs away.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NOBLES.</speaker>
<line>Heavens send your voyage to as good effect,</line>

<stagedir>Enter the king of Cornwall and his man booted and spurred, a riding wand and letter in his hand.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>CORNWALL.</speaker>
<line>But how far distant are we from the court?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SERVANT.</speaker>
<line>Some twenty miles, my lord, or thereabouts.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CORNWALL.</speaker>
<line>It seemeth to me twenty thousand miles:</line>
<line>Yet hope I to be there within this hour.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SERVANT.</speaker>
<line>Then are you like to ride alone for me.</line>
<line>I think, my lord is weary of his life. <stagedir>to
himself.</stagedir>
</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CORNWALL.</speaker>
<line>Sweet Gonorill, I long to see thy face,</line>
<line>Which hast so kindly gratified my love.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter the King of Cambria booted and spurred, and his
man with a wand and a letter.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>CAMBRIA.</speaker>
<line>Get a fresh horse: for by my soul I swear, </line>
<stagedir>looks at the letter.</stagedir>
<line>I am past patience, longer to forbear</line>
<line>The wished sight of my beloved mistress,</line>
<line>Dear Ragan, stay and comfort of my life.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SERVANT.</speaker>
<line>Now what in god's name doth my lord intend?</line>
<stagedir>to himself.</stagedir> 
<line>He thinks he never shall come at his journey's end.</line>
<line>I would he had old Daedalus' waxen wings,</line>
<line>That he might fly, so I might stay behind:</line>
<line>For ere we get to Troynovant, I see,</line>
<line>He quite will tire himself, his horse and me.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Cornwall and Cambria look one upon another and start to
see each other there</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>CORNWALL.</speaker>
<line>Brother of Cambria, we greet you well,</line>
<line>As one whom here we little did expect.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CAMBRIA.</speaker>
<line>Brother of Cornwall, met in happy time:</line>
<line>I thought as much to have met with the souldan of Persia,</line>
<line>As to have met you in this place, my lord.</line>
<line>No doubt, it is about some great affairs,</line>
<line>That makes you here so slenderly accompanied.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CORNWALL.</speaker>
<line>To say the truth, my lord, it is no less,</line>
<line>And for your part some hasty wind of chance</line>
<line>Hath blown you hither thus upon the sudden.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CAMBRIA.</speaker>
<line>My lord, to break off further circumstances,</line>
<line>For at this time I cannot brook delays:</line>
<line>Tell you your reason, I will tell you mine.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CORNWALL.</speaker>
<line>In faith, content, and therefore to be brief;</line>
<line>For I am sure my haste is as great as yours:</line>
<line>I am sent for, to come unto King Leir,</line>
<line>Who by these present letters promiseth</line>
<line>His eldest daughter, lovely Gonorill,</line>
<line>To me in marriage, and for present dowry,</line>
<line>The moiety of half his regiment.</line>
<line>The lady's love I long ago possessed:</line>
<line>But until now I never had the father's.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CAMBRIA.</speaker>
<line>You tell me wonders, yet I will relate</line>
<line>Strange news, and henceforth we must brothers call;</line>
<line>Witness these lines: his honourable age,</line>
<line>Being weary of the troubles of his crown,</line>
<line>His princely daughter Ragan will bestow</line>
<line>On me in marriage, with half his seignories,</line>
<line>Whom I would gladly have accepted of,</line>
<line>With the third part, her complements are such.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CORNWALL.</speaker>
<line>If I have one half, and you have the other,</line>
<line>Then between us we must needs have the whole.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CAMBRIA.</speaker>
<line>The hole! how mean you that? 'sblood, I hope,</line>
<line>We shall have two holes between us.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CORNWALL.</speaker>
<line>Why, the whole kingdom.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CAMBRIA.</speaker>
<line>Ay, that is very true.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CORNWALL.</speaker>
<line>What then is left for his third daughter's dowry,</line>
<line>Lovely Cordella, whom the world admires?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CAMBRIA.</speaker>
<line>It is very strange, I know not what to think,</line>
<line>Unless they mean to make a nun of her.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CORNWALL.</speaker>
<line>It were pity such rare beauty should be hid</line>
<line>Within the compass of a cloister's wall:</line>
<line>But howsoever, if Leir's words prove true,</line>
<line>It will be good, my lord, for me and you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CAMBRIA.</speaker>
<line>Then let us haste, all danger to prevent,</line>
<line>For fear delays do alter his intent.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exeunt</stagedir>

<scene>
<scenetitle>Scene III </scenetitle>

<stagedir>Enter Gonorill and Ragan.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>GONORILL.</speaker>
<line>Sister, when did you see Cordella last,</line>
<line>That pretty piece, that thinks none good enough</line>
<line>To speak to her, because, sir-reverence,</line>
<line>She hath a little beauty extraordinary?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>RAGAN.</speaker>
<line>Since time my father warned her from his presence,</line>
<line>I never saw her, that I can remember.</line>
<line>God give her joy of her surpassing beauty;</line>
<line>I think, her dowry will be small enough.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GONORILL.</speaker>
<line>I have incensed my father so against her,</line>
<line>As he will never be reclaimed again.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>RAGAN.</speaker>
<line>I was not much behind to do the like.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GONORILL.</speaker>
<line>Faith, sister, what moves you to bear her such good-will?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>RAGAN.</speaker>
<line>In truth, I think, the same that moveth you;</line>
<line>Because she doth surpass us both in beauty.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GONORILL.</speaker>
<line>Beshrew your fingers, how right you can guess:</line>
<line>I tell you true, it cuts me to the heart.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>RAGAN.</speaker>
<line>But we will keep her low enough, I warrant,</line>
<line>And clip her wings for mounting up too high.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GONORILL.</speaker>
<line>Who ever hath her, shall have a rich marriage of her.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>RAGAN.</speaker>
<line>She were right fit to make a parson's wife:</line>
<line>For they, men say, do love fair women well,</line>
<line>And many times do marry them with nothing.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GONORILL.</speaker>
<line>With nothing! marry god forbid: why, are there any such?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>RAGAN.</speaker>
<line>I mean, no money.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GONORILL.</speaker>
<line>I cry you mercy, I mistook you much:</line>
<line>And she is far too stately for the church;</line>
<line>She will lay her husband's benefice on her back,</line>
<line>Even in one gown, if she may have her will.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>RAGAN.</speaker>
<line>In faith, poor soul, I pity her a little.</line>
<line>Would she were less fair, or more fortunate.</line>
<line>Well, I think long until I see my Morgan,</line>
<line>The gallant prince of Cambria, here arrive.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GONORILL.</speaker>
<line>And so do I, until the Cornwall king</line>
<line>Present himself, to consummate my joys.</line>
<line>Peace, here cometh my father.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Leir, Perillus, and others.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>Cease, good my lords, and sue not to reverse</line>
<line>Our censure, which is now irrevocable.</line>
<line>We have dispatched letters of contract</line>
<line>Unto the kings of Cambria and of Cornwall;</line>
<line>Our hand and seal will justify no less:</line>
<line>Then do not so dishonour me, my lords</line>
<line>As to make shipwreck of our kingly word.</line>
<line>I am as kind as is the pelican,</line>
<line>That kills itself, to save her young ones' lives:</line>
<line>And yet as jealous as the princely eagle,</line>
<line>That kills her young ones, if they do but dazzle</line>
<line>Upon the radiant splendour of the sun.</line>
<line>Within this two days I expect their coming.</line>
<stagedir>Enter kings of Cornwall and Cambria.</stagedir> 
<line>But in good time, they are arrived already.</line>
<line>This haste of yours, my lords, doth testify</line>
<line>The fervent love you bear unto my daughters:</line>
<line>And think yourselves as welcome to King Leir,</line>
<line>As ever Priam's children were to him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CORNWALL.</speaker>
<line>My gracious lord, and father too, I hope,</line>
<line>Pardon, for that I made no greater haste:</line>
<line>But were my horse as swift as were my will,</line>
<line>I long ere this had seen your majesty.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CAMBRIA.</speaker>
<line>No other excuse of absence can I frame,</line>
<line>Than what my brother hath informed your grace:</line>
<line>Or our undeserved welcome, we do vow,</line>
<line>Perpetually to rest at your command.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CORNWALL.</speaker>
<line>But you, sweet love, illustrious Gonorill,</line>
<line>The regent, and the sovereign of my soul,</line>
<line>Is Cornwall welcome to your excellency?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GONORILL.</speaker>
<line>As welcome, as Leander was to hero,</line>
<line>Or brave Aeneas to the Carthage queen:</line>
<line>So and more welcome is your grace to me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CAMBRIA.</speaker>
<line>O, may my fortune prove no worse then his,</line>
<line>Since heavens do know, my fancy is as much.</line>
<line>Dear Ragan, say, if welcome unto thee,</line>
<line>All welcomes else will little comfort me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>RAGAN.</speaker>
<line>As gold is welcome to the covetous eye,</line>
<line>As sleep is welcome to the traveller,</line>
<line>As is fresh water to sea-beaten men,</line>
<line>Or moistened showers unto the parched ground,</line>
<line>Or anything more welcomer than this,</line>
<line>So and more welcome lovely Morgan is.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>What resteth then, but that we consummate,</line>
<line>The celebration of these nuptial rites?</line>
<line>My kingdom I do equally divide.</line>
<line>Princes draw lots, and take your chance as falls.</line>
<stagedir>Then they draw lots.</stagedir> 
<line>These I resign as freely unto you,</line>
<line>As erst by true succession they were mine.</line>
<line>And here I do freely dispossess myself,</line>
<line>And make you two my true adopted heirs:</line>
<line>Myself will sojourn with my son of Cornwall,</line>
<line>And take me to my prayers and my beads.</line>
<line>I know, my daughter Ragan will be sorry,</line>
<line>Because I do not spend my days with her:</line>
<line>Would I were able to be with both at once;</line>
<line>They are the kindest girls in Christendom.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PERILLUS.</speaker>
<line>I have been silent all this while, my lord,</line>
<line>To see if any worthier than myself,</line>
<line>Would once have spoke in poor Cordella's cause:</line>
<line>But love or fear ties silence to their tongues.</line>
<line>Oh, hear me speak for her, my gracious lord,</line>
<line>Whose deeds have not deserved this ruthless doom,</line>
<line>As thus to disinherit her of all.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>Urge this no more, and if thou love thy life:</line>
<line>I say, she is no daughter, that doth scorn</line>
<line>To tell her father how she loveth him.</line>
<line>Whoever speaketh hereof to me again,</line>
<line>I will esteem him for my mortal foe.</line>
<line>Come, let us in, to celebrate with joy,</line>
<line>The happy nuptials of these lovely pairs.</line>
<stagedir>Exeunt omnes, manes Perillus.</stagedir> 
<line>Perillus. Ah, who so blind, as they that will not see</line>
<line>The near approach of their own misery?</line>
<line>Poor lady, I extremely pity her:</line>
<line>And whilst I live, each drop of my heart blood,</line>
<line>Will I strain forth, to do her any good.</line>

<scenetitle>Scene IV</scenetitle>

<stagedir>Enter the Gallian king and Mumford, desguised like pilgrims.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>MUMFORD.</speaker>
<line>My lord, how do you brook this British air?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<line>'My lord,' I told you of this foolish humour,</line>
<line>And bound you to the contrary, you know.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MUMFORD.</speaker>
<line>Pardon me for once, my lord; I did forget.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<line>'My lord' again? then let us have nothing else,</line>
<line>And so be taken for spies, and then it is well.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MUMFORD.</speaker>
<line>'Swounds, I could bite my tongue in two for anger:</line>
<line>For god's sake name yourself some proper name.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<line>Call me Tresillus; I'll call thee Denapoll.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MUMFORD.</speaker>
<line>Might I be made the monarch of the world,</line>
<line>I could not hit upon these names, I swear.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<line>Then call me Will, I will call thee Jack.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MUMFORD.</speaker>
<line>Well, be it so, for I have well deserved to be called Jack.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<line>Stand close; for here a British lady cometh:</line>
<stagedir>Enter Cordella</stagedir>
<line>A fairer creature never mine eyes beheld.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CORDELLA.</speaker>
<line>This is a day of joy unto my sisters,</line>
<line>Wherein they both are married unto kings;</line>
<line>And I, by birth, as worthy as themselves,</line>
<line>Am turned into the world, to seek my fortune.</line>
<line>How may I blame the fickle queen of chance,</line>
<line>That maketh me a pattern of her power?</line>
<line>Ah, poor weak maid, whose imbecility</line>
<line>Is far unable to endure these brunts.</line>
<line>Oh, father Leir, how dost thou wrong thy child,</line>
<line>Who always was obedient to thy will!</line>
<line>But why accuse I fortune and my father?</line>
<line>No, no, it is the pleasure of my God:</line>
<line>And I do willingly embrace the rod.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<line>It is no goddess; for she doth complain</line>
<line>On fortune, and the unkindness of her father.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CORDELLA.</speaker>
<line>These costly robes ill-fitting my estate</line>
<line>I will exchange for other meaner habits.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MUMFORD.</speaker>
<line>Now if I had a kingdom in my hands,</line>
<line>I would exchange it for a milkmaid's smock and petticoat,</line>
<line>That she and I might shift our clothes together.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CORDELLA.</speaker>
<line>I will betake me to my thread and needle,</line>
<line>And earn my living with my fingers' ends.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MUMFORD.</speaker>
<line>O brave! god willing, thou shalt have my custom,</line>
<line>By sweet saint Denis, here I sadly swear,</line>
<line>For all the shirts and night-gear that I wear.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CORDELLA.</speaker>
<line>I will profess and vow a maiden's life.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MUMFORD.</speaker>
<line>Then I protest thou shalt not have my custom.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<line>I can forbear no longer for to speak:</line>
<line>For if I do, I think my heart will break.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MUMFORD.</speaker>
<line>'Sblood, will, I hope you are not in love with my sempster.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<line>I am in such a labyrinth of love,</line>
<line>As that I know not which way to get out.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MUMFORD.</speaker>
<line>You will never get out, unless you first get in.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<line>I prithee jack, cross not my passions.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MUMFORD.</speaker>
<line>Prithee will, to her, and try her patience.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<line>Thou fairest creature, whatsoever thou art,</line>
<line>That ever any mortal eyes beheld,</line>
<line>Vouchsafe to me, who have overheard thy woes,</line>
<line>To show the cause of these thy sad laments.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CORDELLA.</speaker>
<line>Ah pilgrims, what avails to show the cause,</line>
<line>When there is no means to find a remedy?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<line>To utter grief, doth ease a heart overcharged.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CORDELLA.</speaker>
<line>To touch a sore, doth aggravate the pain.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<line>The silly mouse, by virtue of her teeth,</line>
<line>Released the princely lion from the net.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CORDELLA.</speaker>
<line>Kind palmer, which so much desirest to hear</line>
<line>The tragic tale of my unhappy youth:</line>
<line>Know this in brief, I am the hapless daughter</line>
<line>Of Leir, sometimes king of Brittany.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<line>Why, who debars his honourable age,</line>
<line>From being still the king of Brittany?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CORDELLA.</speaker>
<line>None, but himself hath dispossessed himself,</line>
<line>And given all his kingdom to the kings</line>
<line>Of Cornwall and of Cambria, with my sisters.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<line>Hath he given nothing to your lovely self?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CORDELLA.</speaker>
<line>He loved me not, and therefore gave me nothing,</line>
<line>Only because I could not flatter him:</line>
<line>And in this day of triumph to my sisters,</line>
<line>Doth fortune triumph in my overthrow.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<line>Sweet lady, say there should come a king,</line>
<line>As good as either of your sisters' husbands,</line>
<line>To crave your love, would you accept of him?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CORDELLA.</speaker>
<line>Oh, do not mock with those in misery,</line>
<line>Nor do not think, though fortune have the power,</line>
<line>To spoil mine honour, and debase my state,</line>
<line>That she hath any interest in my mind:</line>
<line>For if the greatest monarch on the earth,</line>
<line>Should sue to me in this extremity,</line>
<line>Except my heart could love, and heart could like,</line>
<line>Better than any that I ever saw,</line>
<line>His great estate no more should move my mind,</line>
<line>Than mountains move by blast of every wind.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<line>Think not, sweet nymph, 'tis holy palmers' guise,</line>
<line>To grieved souls fresh torments to devise:</line>
<line>Therefore in witness of my true intent,</line>
<line>Let heaven and earth bear record of my words:</line>
<line>There is a young and lusty Gallian king,</line>
<line>So like to me, as I am to myself,</line>
<line>That earnestly doth crave to have thy love,</line>
<line>And join with thee in Hymen's sacred bonds.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CORDELLA.</speaker>
<line>The like to thee did ne'er these eyes behold;</line>
<line>Oh live to add new torments to my grief:</line>
<line>Why didst thou thus entrap me unawares?</line>
<line>Ah palmer, my estate doth not befit</line>
<line>A kingly marriage as the case now stands.</line>
<line>Whilom whenas I lived in honour's height,</line>
<line>A prince perhaps might postulate my love:</line>
<line>Now misery, dishonour and disgrace,</line>
<line>Hath light on me, and quite reversed the case.</line>
<line>Thy king will hold thee wise, if thou surcease</line>
<line>The suit, whereas no dowry will ensue.</line>
<line>Then be advised, palmer, what to do:</line>
<line>Cease for thy king, seek for thyself to woo.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<line>Your birth's too high for any, but a king.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CORDELLA.</speaker>
<line>My mind is low enough to love a palmer,</line>
<line>Rather than any king upon the earth.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<line>O, but you never can endure their life,</line>
<line>Which is so straight and full of penury.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CORDELLA.</speaker>
<line>O yes, I can, and happy if I might:</line>
<line>I will hold thy palmer's staff within my hand,</line>
<line>And think it is the sceptre of a queen.</line>
<line>Sometime I will set thy bonnet on my head,</line>
<line>And think I wear a rich imperial crown.</line>
<line>Sometime I will help thee in thy holy prayers,</line>
<line>And think I am with thee in paradise.</line>
<line>Thus I will mock fortune as she mocketh me,</line>
<line>And never will lovely choice repent:</line>
<line>For, having thee, I shall have all content.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<line>It were sin to hold her longer in suspense,</line>
<line>Since that my soul hath vowed she shall be mine.</line>
<line>Ah, dear Cordella, cordial to my heart,</line>
<line>I am no palmer, as I seem to be,</line>
<line>But hither come in this unknown disguise,</line>
<line>To view the admired beauty of those eyes.</line>
<line>I am the king of Gallia, gentle maid,</line>
<line>Although thus slenderly accompanied,</line>
<line>And yet thy vassal by imperious love,</line>
<line>And sworn to serve thee everlastingly.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CORDELLA.</speaker>
<line>Whatever you be, of high or low descent,</line>
<line>All's one to me, I do request but this:</line>
<line>That as I am, you will accept of me,</line>

<line>The king hath dispossessed himself of all,</line>
<line>Those to advance, which scarce will give him thanks:</line>
<line>His youngest daughter he hath turned away,</line>
<line>And no man knows what is become of her.</line>
<line>He sojourns now in Cornwall with the eldest,</line>
<line>Who flattered him, until she did obtain</line>
<line>That at his hands, which now she doth possess:</line>
<line>And now she sees he hath no more to give,</line>
<line>It grieves her heart to see her father live.</line>
<line>Oh, whom should man trust in this wicked age,</line>
<line>When children thus against their parents rage?</line>
<line>But he, the mirror of mild patience,</line>
<line>Puts up all wrongs, and never gives reply:</line>
<line>Yet shames she not in most opprobrious sort,</line>
<line>To call him fool and dotard to his face,</line>
<line>And sets her parasites of purpose oft,</line>
<line>In scoffing wise to offer him disgrace.</line>
<line>Oh iron age! O times! O monstrous, vile,</line>
<line>When parents are contemned of the child!</line>
<line>His pension she hath half restrained from him,</line>
<line>And will, ere long, the other half, I fear:</line>
<line>For she thinks nothing is bestowed in vain,</line>
<line>But that which doth her father's life maintain.</line>
<line>Trust not alliance; but trust strangers rather,</line>
<line>Since daughters prove disloyal to the father.</line>
<line>Well, I will counsel him the best I can:</line>
<line>Would I were able to redress his wrong.</line>

<line>Could any woman of our dignity</line>
<line>Endure such quips and peremptory taunts,</line>
<line>As I do daily from my doting father?</line>
<line>Doth it not suffice that I him keep of alms,</line>
<line>Who is not able for to keep himself?</line>
<line>But as if he were our better, he should think</line>
<line>To check and snap me up at every word.</line>
<line>I cannot make me a new fashioned gown,</line>
<line>And set it forth with more than common cost;</line>
<line>But his old doting doltish withered wit,</line>
<line>Is sure to give a senseless check for it.</line>
<line>I cannot make a banquet extraordinary,</line>
<line>To grace myself and spread my name abroad,</line>
<line>But he, old fool, is captious by and by,</line>
<line>And saith, the cost would well suffice for twice.</line>
<line>Judge then, I pray, what reason is it, that I</line>
<line>Should stand alone charged with his vain expense,</line>
<line>And that my sister Ragan should go free,</line>
<line>To whom he gave as much as unto me?</line>
<line>I prithee, Skalliger, tell me, if thou know,</line>
<line>By any means to rid me of this woe.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SKALLIGER.</speaker>
<line>Your many favours still bestowed on me,</line>
<line>Bind me in duty to advise your grace,</line>
<line>How you may soonest remedy this ill.</line>
<line>The large allowance which he hath from you,</line>
<line>Is that which makes him so forget himself:</line>
<line>Therefore abridge it half, and you shall see,</line>
<line>That having less, he will more thankful be:</line>
<line>For why, abundance maketh us forget</line>
<line>The fountains whence the benefits do spring.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GONORILL.</speaker>
<line>Well, Skalliger, for thy kind advice herein,</line>
<line>I will not be ungrateful, if I live:</line>

<line>The nearer we do grow unto our graves,</line>
<line>The less we do delight in worldly joys.</line>

<line>My Gonorill, you come in wished time,</line>

<speech>
<speaker>GONORILL.</speaker>
<line>What, do you fear, that I have angered him?</line>
<line>Hath he complained of me unto my lord?</line>
<line>I will provide him a piece of bread and cheese;</line>
<line>For in a time he will practise nothing else,</line>
<line>Than carry tales from one unto another.</line>
<line>It is all his practice for to kindle strife,</line>
<line>Betwixt you, my lord, and me your loving wife:</line>
<line>But I will take an order, if I can,</line>
<line>To cease the effect, where first the cause began.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CORNWALL.</speaker>
<line>Sweet, be not angry in a partial cause,</line>
<line>He never complained of thee in all his life.</line>
<line>Father, you must not weigh a woman's words.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>Alas, not I: poor soul, she breeds young bones,</line>
<line>And that is it makes her so touchy sure.</line>

<line>What, breeds young bones already! you will make</line>

<line>Else aged Leir them could never find</line>
<line>Cruel to him, to whom he hath been kind.</line>
<line>Why do I over-live myself, to see</line>
<line>The course of nature quite reversed in me?</line>
<line>Ah, gentle death, if ever any wight</line>

<line>One, who doth bear as great a share of grief,</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>ah, good my friend, how ill art thou advised,</line>
<line>For to consort with miserable men:</line>
<line>Go learn to flatter, where thou mayest in time</line>
<line>Get favour amongst the mighty, and so climb:</line>
<line>For now I am so poor and full of want,</line>
<line>As that I never can recompense thy love.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PERILLUS.</speaker>
<line>What is got by flattery doth not long endure;</line>
<line>And men in favour live not most secure.</line>
<line>My conscience tells me, if I should forsake you,</line>
<line>I were the hatefullest execrement on the earth:</line>
<line>Which well do know, in course of former time,</line>
<line>How good my lord hath been to me and mine.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>Did I ere raise thee higher than the rest</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PERILLUS.</speaker>
<line>I never did seek it; but by your good grace,</line>
<line>I still enjoyed my own with quietness.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>Did I ere give thee living, to increase</line>
<line>The due revenues which thy father left?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PERILLUS.</speaker>
<line>I had enough, my lord, and having that,</line>
<line>What should you need to give me any more?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>Oh, did I ever dispossess myself,</line>
<line>And give thee half my kingdom in good-will?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PERILLUS.</speaker>
<line>Alas, my lord, there were no reason, why</line>
<line>You should have such a thought, to give it me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>nay, if thou talk of reason, then be mute;</line>
<line>For with good reason I can thee confute.</line>
<line>If they, which first by nature's sacred law,</line>
<line>Do owe to me the tribute of their lives;</line>
<line>If they to whom I always have been kind,</line>
<line>And bountiful beyond comparison;</line>
<line>If they, for whom I have undone myself,</line>
<line>And brought my age unto this extreme want,</line>
<line>Do now reject, contemn, despise, abhor me,</line>
<line>What reason moveth thee to sorrow for me?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PERILLUS.</speaker>
<line>Where reason fails, let tears confirm my love,</line>

<line>You shall be welcome, if you please to go.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>Oh, how thy words add sorrow to my soul,</line>
<line>To think of my unkindness to Cordella!</line>
<line>Whom causeless I did dispossess of all,</line>
<line>Upon the unkind suggestions of her sisters:</line>
<line>And for her sake, I think this heavy doom</line>
<line>Is fallen on me, and not without desert:</line>
<line>Yet unto Ragan was I always kind,</line>
<line>And gave to her the half of all I had:</line>
<line>It may be, if I should to her repair,</line>
<line>She would be kinder, and entreat me fair.</line>
</speech>

<line>My eldest sister lives in royal state,</line>

<line>My father with her is quarter-master still,</line>
<line>And many times restrains her of her will:</line>
<line>But if he were with me, and served me so,</line>

<line>Hath sequestered thy father from our presence,</line>
<line>That no report can yet be heard of him?</line>
<line>Some great unkindness hath been offered him,</line>
<line>Exceeding far the bounds of patience:</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GONORILL.</speaker>
<line>Alas, my lord, whom doth it touch so near,</line>
<line>Or who hath interest in this grief, but I,</line>
<line>Whom sorrow had brought to her longest home,</line>
<line>But that I know his qualities so well?</line>
<line>I know, he is but stolen upon my sister</line>
<line>At unawares, to see her how she fares,</line>
<line>And spend a little time with her, to note</line>
<line>How all things go, and how she likes her choice:</line>
<line>And when occasion serves, he will steal from her,</line>
<line>And unawares return to us again.</line>
<line>Therefore, my lord, be frolic, and resolve</line>
<line>To see my father here again ere long.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CORNWALL.</speaker>
<line>I hope so too; but yet to be more sure,</line>

<speaker>GONORILL.</speaker>

<line>And temper him before he doth depart</line>
<line>With sweet persuasions, and with sound rewards,</line>
<line>That his report shall ratify my speech,</line>
<line>And make my lord cease further to inquire.</line>
<line>If he be not gone to my sister's court,</line>
<line>As sure my mind presageth that he is,</line>
<line>Fall sick, and as common passenger,</line>
<line>Be dead and buried: would god it were so well;</line>
<line>For then there were no more to do, but this,</line>
<line>He went away, and none knows where he is.</line>
<line>But say he be in Cambria with the king,</line>
<line>And there exclaim against me, as he will:</line>
<line>I know he is as welcome to my sister,</line>
<line>As water is into a broken ship.</line>
<line>Well, after him I will send such thunderclaps</line>
<line>Of slander, scandal, and invented tales,</line>
<line>That all the blame shall be removed from me,</line>
<line>And unperceived rebound upon himself.</line>
<line>Thus with one nail another I will expel,</line>

<speech>
<speaker>MESSENGER.</speaker>
<line>Unto your father, if he be there.</line>

<line>Let me see them.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>MESSENGER.</speaker>
<line>Madam, I hope your grace will stand</line>
<line>Between me and my neck-verse, if I be</line>
<line>Called in question, for opening the king's letters.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GONORILL.</speaker>
<line>It was I that opened them, it was not thou.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MESSENGER.</speaker>
<line>Ay, but you need not care: and so must I,</line>
<line>A handsome man, be quickly trussed up,</line>
<line>And when a man is hanged, all the world cannot save him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GONORILL.</speaker>
<line>He that hangs thee, were better hang his father,</line>
<line>Or that but hurts thee in the least degree.</line>
<line>I tell thee, we make great account of thee.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MESSENGER.</speaker>
<line>I am overjoyed, I surfeit of sweet words:</line>
<line>Kind queen, had I a hundred lives, I would</line>
<line>Spend ninety-nine of them for you, for that word.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GONORILL.</speaker>
<line>Ay, but thou wouldst keep one life still,</line>
<line>And that is as many as thou art like to have.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MESSENGER.</speaker>
<line>That one life is not too dear for my good
queen; this sword, this buckler, this head, this heart,
these hands, arms, legs, tripes, bowels, and all the members
else whatsoever, are at your dispose; use me, trust me,
command me: if I fail in anything, tie me to a dung-cart,
and make a scavenger's horse of me, and whip me, so long as
I have any skin on my back.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GONORILL.</speaker>
<line>In token of further employment, take that.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Flings him a purse.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>MESSENGER.</speaker>
<line>A strong bond, a firm obligation, good
in law, good in law: if I keep not the condition, let my
neck be the forfeiture of my negligence.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GONORILL.</speaker>
<line>I like thee well, thou hast a good tongue.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MESSENGER.</speaker>
<line>And as bad a tongue if it be set on it, as
any oysterwife at Billingsgate hath: why, I have made many
of my neighbours forsake their houses with railing upon
them, and go dwell elsewhere; and so by my means houses have
been good cheap in our parish: my tongue being well whetted
with choler, is more sharp than a razor of Palermo.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GONORILL.</speaker>
<line>O, thou art a fit man for my purpose.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MESSENGER.</speaker>
<line>Commend me not, sweet queen, before you try me. as my deserts are, so do think of me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GONORILL.</speaker>
<line>Well said, then this is thy trial: instead
of carrying the king's letters to my father, carry thou
these letters to my sister, which contain matter quite
contrary to the other: there shall she be given to
understand, that my father hath detracted her, given out
slanderous speeches against her; that he hath most
intolerably abused me, set my lord and me at variance, and
made mutinies amongst the commons.</line>
<line>These things (although it be not so)</line>
<line>Yet thou must affirm them to be true,</line>
<line>With oaths and protestations as will serve</line>
<line>To drive my sister out of love with him,</line>
<line>And cause my will accomplished to be.</line>
<line>This do, thou winnest my favour for ever,</line>
<line>And makest a high way of preferment to thee</line>
<line>And all thy friends.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MESSENGER.</speaker>
<line>It sufficeth, conceit it is already done:</line>
<line>I will so tongue-whip him, that I will</line>
<line>Leave him as bare of credit, as a poulter</line>
<line>Leaves a cony, when she pulls off his skin.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GONORILL.</speaker>
<line>Yet there is a further matter.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MESSENGER.</speaker>
<line>I thirst to hear it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GONORILL.</speaker>
<line>If my sister thinketh convenient, as my
letters importeth, to make him away, hast thou the heart to
effect it?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MESSENGER.</speaker>
<line>Few words are best in so small a matter:</line>
<line>These are but trifles. By this book I will.</line>

<line>I have been over-negligent to-day,</line>
<line>In going to the temple of my God,</line>
<line>To render thanks for all his benefits,</line>
<line>Which he miraculously hath bestowed on me,</line>
<line>In raising me out of my mean estate,</line>
<line>Whenas I was devoid of worldly friends,</line>
<line>And placing me in such a sweet content,</line>
<line>As far exceeds the reach of my deserts.</line>
<line>My kingly husband, mirror of his time,</line>
<line>For zeal, for justice, kindness, and for care</line>
<line>To God, his subjects, me, and common weal,</line>
<line>By his appointment was ordained for me.</line>
<line>I cannot wish the thing that I do want;</line>
<line>I cannot want the thing but I may have,</line>
<line>Save only this which I shall never obtain,</line>
<line>My father's love, oh this I never shall gain.</line>
<line>I would abstain from any nutriment,</line>
<line>And pine my body to the very bones:</line>
<line>Barefoot I would on pilgrimage set forth</line>
<line>Unto the furthest quarters of the earth,</line>
<line>And all my lifetime would I sackcloth wear,</line>
<line>And mourning-wise pour dust upon my head:</line>
<line>So he but to forgive me once would please,</line>
<line>That his gray hairs might go to heaven in peace.</line>

<line>Or wherein justly I have deserved blame.</line>
<line>Oh, sisters! you are much to blame in this,</line>

<stagedir>Enter Leir and Perillus, faintly.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>PERILLUS.</speaker>
<line>Rest on me, my lord, and stay yourself,</line>
<line>The way seems tedious to your aged limbs.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>Nay, rest on me, kind friend, and stay thyself,</line>
<line>Thou art as old as I, but more kind.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PERILLUS.</speaker>
<line>Ah, good my lord, it ill befits, that I</line>
<line>Should lean upon the person of a King.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>But it fits worse, that I should bring thee forth,</line>
<line>That had no cause to come along with me,</line>
<line>Through these uncouth paths, and tireful ways,</line>
<line>And never ease thy fainting limbs a whit.</line>
<line>Thou hast left all, ay, all to come with me,</line>
<line>And I, for all, have naught to guerdon thee.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PERILLUS.</speaker>
<line>Cease, good my lord, to aggravate my woes,</line>
<line>With these kind words, which cuts my heart in two,</line>
<line>To think your will should want the power to do.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>Cease, good Perillus, for to call me lord,</line>
<line>And think me but the shadow of myself.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PERILLUS.</speaker>
<line>That honourable title will I give,</line>
<line>Unto my lord, so long as I do live.</line>
<line>Oh, be of comfort; for I see the place</line>
<line>Whereas your daughter keeps her residence.</line>
<line>And lo, in happy time the Cambrian prince</line>
<line>Is here arrived, to gratify our coming.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter the prince of Cambria, Ragan, and nobles. Look upon them, and whisper together</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>Were I best speak, or sit me down and die?</line>
<line>I am ashamed to tell this heavy tale.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PERILLUS.</speaker>
<line>Then let me tell it, if you please, my lord:</line>
<line>It is shame for them that were the cause thereof.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CAMBRIA.</speaker>
<line>What two old men are those that seem so sad?</line>
<line>Methinks, I should remember well their looks.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>RAGAN.</speaker>
<line>No, I mistake not, sure it is my father:</line>
<line>I must dissemble kindness now of force.</line>
<stagedir>She runs to him, and kneels down, saying:</stagedir> 
<line>Father, I bid you welcome, full of grief,</line>
<line>To see your grace used thus unworthily,</line>
<line>And ill befitting for your reverend age,</line>
<line>To come on foot a journey so endurable.</line>
<line>Oh, what disaster chance hath been the cause,</line>
<line>To make your cheeks so hollow, spare and lean?</line>
<line>He cannot speak for weeping: for god's love, come.</line>
<line>Let us refresh him with some needful things,</line>
<line>And at more leisure we may better know,</line>
<line>Whence springs the ground of this unlooked-for woe.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CAMBRIA.</speaker>
<line>Come, father, ere we any further talk,</line>
<line>You shall refresh you after this weary walk.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exeunt, manet Ragan</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>RAGAN.</speaker>
<line>Comes he to me with finger in the eye,</line>
<line>To tell a tale against my sister here?</line>
<line>Whom I do know, he greatly hath abused:</line>
<line>And now like a contentious crafty wretch,</line>
<line>He first begins for to complain himself,</line>
<line>Whenas himself is in the greatest fault?</line>
<line>I will not be partial in my sister's cause;</line>
<line>Nor yet believe his doting vain reports;</line>
<line>Who for a trifle (safely) I dare say,</line>
<line>Upon a spleen is stolen thence away:</line>
<line>And here (forsooth) he hopeth to have harbour,</line>
<line>And to be moaned and made on like a child:</line>
<line>But ere it be long, his coming he shall curse,</line>
<line>And truly say, he came from bad to worse:</line>
<line>Yet will I make fair wheather, to procure</line>
<line>Convenient means, and then I will strike it sure.</line>

<stagedir>Enter Messenger, solus.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>MESSENGER.</speaker>
<line>Now happily I am arrived here,</line>
<line>Before the stately palace of the Cambrian king:</line>
<line>If Leir be here safe-seated, and in rest,</line>
<line>To rouse him from it I will do my best.</line>
<stagedir>Enter Ragan</stagedir> 
<line>Now bags of gold, your virtue is, no doubt</line>
<line>To make me in my message bold and stout.</line>
<line>The king of heaven preserve your Majesty.</line>
<line>And send your highness everlasting reign.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>RAGAN.</speaker>
<line>Thanks, good my friend; but what imports thy message?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MESSENGER.</speaker>
<line>Kind greetings from the Cornwall queen:</line>
<line>The residue these letters will declare.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>She opens the letters</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>RAGAN.</speaker>
<line>How fares our royal sister?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MESSENGER.</speaker>
<line>I did leave her, at my parting, in good health.</line>
<stagedir>She reads the letters, frowns and stamps</stagedir>
<line>See how her colour comes and goes again</line>
<line>Now red as scarlet, now as pale as ash:</line>
<line>See how she knits her brow, and bites her lips,</line>
<line>And stamps, and makes a dumb show of disdain,</line>
<line>Mixed with revenge, and violent extremes.</line>
<line>Here will be more work and more crowns for me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>RAGAN.</speaker>
<line>Alas, poor soul, and hath he used her thus?</line>
<line>And is he now come hither, with intent</line>
<line>To set divorce betwixt my lord and me?</line>
<line>Doth he give out, that he doth hear report,</line>
<line>That I do rule my husband as I list,</line>
<line>And therefore means to alter so the case,</line>
<line>That I shall know my lord to be my head?</line>
<line>Well, it were best for him to take good heed,</line>
<line>Or I will make him hop without a head,</line>
<line>For his presumption, dottard that he is.</line>
<line>In Cornwall he hath made such mutinies,</line>
<line>First, setting of the king against the queen;</line>
<line>Then stirring up the commons against the king;</line>
<line>That had he there continued any longer,</line>
<line>He had been called in question for his fact.</line>
<line>So upon that occasion thence he fled,</line>
<line>And comes thus slyly stealing unto us;</line>
<line>And now already since his coming hither,</line>
<line>My lord and he are grown in such a league,</line>
<line>That I can have no conference with his grace:</line>
<line>I fear, he doth already intimate</line>
<line>Some forged cavillations against my state:</line>
<line>It is therefore best to cut him off in time,</line>
<line>Lest slanderous rumours once abroad dispersed,</line>
<line>It is to late for them to be reversed.</line>
<line>Friend, as the tenour of these letters shows,</line>
<line>My sister puts great confidence in thee.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MESSENGER.</speaker>
<line>She never yet committed trust to me,</line>
<line>But that, I hope, she found me always faithful:</line>
<line>So will I be to any friend of hers,</line>
<line>That hath occasion to employ my help.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>RAGAN.</speaker>
<line>Hast thou the heart to act a stratagem,</line>
<line>And give a stab or two, if need require?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MESSENGER.</speaker>
<line>I have a heart compact of adamant,</line>
<line>Which never knew what melting pity meant.</line>
<line>I weigh no more the murdering of a man,</line>
<line>Than I respect the cracking of a flea,</line>
<line>When I do catch her biting on my skin.</line>
<line>If you will have your husband or your father,</line>
<line>Or both of them sent to another world,</line>
<line>Do but command me do it, it shall be done.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>RAGAN.</speaker>
<line>It is enough, we make no doubt of thee:</line>
<line>Meet us tomorrow here, at nine o'clock:</line>
<line>Meanwhile, farewell, and drink that for my sake.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>MESSENGER.</speaker>
<line>Ay, this is it will make me do the deed:</line>
<line>Oh, had I every day such customers,</line>
<line>This were the gainfullest trade in Christendom!</line>
<line>A purse of gold given for a paltry stab.</line>
<line>Why, here's a wench that longs to have a stab.</line>
<line>Well, I could give it her, and never hurt her neither.</line>

<stagedir>Enter the Gallian king, and Cordella.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<line>When will these clouds of sorrow once disperse,</line>
<line>And smiling joy triumph upon thy brow?</line>
<line>When will this</line>
<line>Scene of sadness have an end,</line>
<line>And pleasant acts ensue, to move delight?</line>
<line>When will my lovely queen cease to lament,</line>
<line>And take some comfort to her grieved thoughts?</line>
<line>If of thyself thou deign'st to have no care,</line>
<line>Yet pity me, whom thy grief makes despair.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CORDELLA.</speaker>
<line>Oh, grieve not you, my lord, you have no cause;</line>
<line>Let not my passions move your mind a whit:</line>
<line>For I am bound by nature to lament</line>
<line>For his ill will, that life to me first lent.</line>
<line>If so the stock be dried with disdain,</line>
<line>Withered and sere the branch must needs remain.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<line>But thou art now graft in another stock;</line>
<line>I am the stock, and thou the lovely branch:</line>
<line>And from my root continual sap shall flow,</line>
<line>To make thee flourish with perpetual spring.</line>
<line>Forget thy father and thy kindred now,</line>
<line>Since they forsake thee like inhuman beasts,</line>
<line>Think they are dead, since all their kindness dies,</line>
<line>And bury them, where black oblivion lies.</line>
<line>Think not thou art the daughter of old Leir,</line>
<line>Who did unkindly disinherit thee:</line>
<line>But think thou art the noble Gallian queen,</line>
<line>And wise to him that dearly loveth thee:</line>
<line>Embrace the joys that present with thee dwell,</line>
<line>Let sorrow pack and hide herself in hell.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CORDELLA.</speaker>
<line>Not that I miss my country or my kin,</line>
<line>My old acquaintance or my ancient friends,</line>
<line>Doth any whit distemperate my mind,</line>
<line>Knowing you, which are more dear to me,</line>
<line>Than country, kin, and all things else can be.</line>
<line>Yet pardon me, my gracious lord, in this:</line>
<line>For what can stop the course of Nature's power?</line>
<line>As easy is it for four-footed beasts,</line>
<line>To stay themselves upon the liquid air,</line>
<line>And mount aloft into the element,</line>
<line>And overstrip the feathered fowls in flight:</line>
<line>As easy is it for the slimy fish,</line>
<line>To live and thrive without the help of water:</line>
<line>As easy is it for the blackamoor,</line>
<line>To wash the tawny colour from his skin,</line>
<line>Which all oppose against the course of nature,</line>
<line>As I am able to forget my father.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<line>Mirror of virtue, Phoenix of our age!</line>
<line>Too kind a daughter for an unkind father,</line>
<line>Be of good comfort; for I will dispatch</line>
<line>Ambassadors immediately for Britain,</line>
<line>Unto the king of Cornwall's court, whereas</line>
<line>Your father keepeth now his residence,</line>
<line>And in the kindest manner him entreat,</line>
<line>That setting former grievances apart,</line>
<line>He will be pleased to come and visit us.</line>
<line>If no entreaty will suffice the turn,</line>
<line>I will offer him the half of all my crown:</line>
<line>If that moves not, we will furnish out a fleet,</line>
<line>And sail to Cornwall for to visit him;</line>
<line>And there you shall be firmly reconciled</line>
<line>In perfit love, as erst you were before.</line>

<line>Where tongue cannot sufficient thanks afford,</line>
<line>The king of heaven remunerate my lord.</line>

<line>How many friends I purchase everywhere!</line>
<line>How many seeks to creep into my favour,</line>
<line>And kiss their hands, and bend their knees to me!</line>
<line>No more, here comes the queen, now shall I know her mind,</line>

<line>My friend, I see thou mindest thy promise well,</line>
<line>And art before me here, methinks, today.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MESSENGER.</speaker>
<line>I am a poor man, and it like your grace;</line>
<line>But yet I always love to keep my word.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>RAGAN.</speaker>
<line>Well, keep thy word with me, and thou shalt see,</line>
<line>That of a poor man I will make thee rich.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MESSENGER.</speaker>
<line>I long to hear it, it might have been dispatched,</line>
<line>If you had told me of it yesternight.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>RAGAN.</speaker>
<line>It is a thing of right strange consequence,</line>
<line>And well I cannot utter it in words.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MESSENGER.</speaker>
<line>It is more strange, that I am not by this</line>
<line>Beside myself, with longing for to hear it.</line>
<line>Were it to meet the devil in his den,</line>
<line>And try a bout with him for a scratched face,</line>
<line>I would undertake it, if you would but bid me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>RAGAN.</speaker>
<line>Ah, good my friend, that I should have thee do,</line>
<line>Is such a thing, as I do shame to speak;</line>
<line>Yet it must needs be done.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MESSENGER.</speaker>
<line>I will speak it for thee, queen: shall I kill thy father?</line>
<line>I know it is that, and if it be so, say.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>RAGAN.</speaker>
<line>Ay.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MESSENGER.</speaker>
<line>Why, that is enough.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>RAGAN.</speaker>
<line>And yet that is not all.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MESSENGER.</speaker>
<line>What else?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>RAGAN.</speaker>
<line>Thou must kill that old man that came with him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MESSENGER.</speaker>
<line>Here are two hands, for each of them is one.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>RAGAN.</speaker>
<line>And for each hand here is a recompense.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Gives him two purses</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>MESSENGER.</speaker>
<line>Oh, that I had ten hands by miracle!</line>
<line>I could tear ten in pieces with my teeth,</line>
<line>So in my mouth you'ld put a purse of gold.</line>
<line>But in what manner must it be effected?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>RAGAN.</speaker>
<line>Tomorrow morning ere the break of day,</line>
<line>I by a wile will send them to the thicket,</line>
<line>That is about some two miles from the court,</line>
<line>And promise them to meet them there myself,</line>
<line>Because I must have private conference,</line>
<line>About some news I have received from Cornwall.</line>
<line>This is enough, I know, they will not fail,</line>
<line>And then be ready for to play thy part:</line>
<line>Which done, thou mayest right easily escape,</line>
<line>And no man once mistrust thee for the fact:</line>
<line>But yet, before thou prosecute the act,</line>
<line>Show him the letter, which my sister sent,</line>
<line>There let him read his own indictment first,</line>
<line>And then proceed to execution:</line>
<line>But see thou faint not; for they will speak fair.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MESSENGER.</speaker>
<line>Could he speak words as pleasing as the pipe</line>
<line>Of Mercury, which charmed the hundred eyes</line>
<line>Of watchful Argos, and enforced him sleep:</line>
<line>Yet here are words so pleasing to my thoughts,</line>
<stagedir>To the purse:</stagedir>
<line>As quite shall take away the sound of his.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit</stagedir>

<line>I wonder that the messenger doth stay,</line>
<line>Whom we dispatched for Cambria so long since:</line>
<line>If that his answer do not please us well,</line>
<line>And he do shew good reason for delay,</line>
<line>I will teach him how to dally with his king,</line>
<line>And to detain us in such long suspense.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GONORILL.</speaker>
<line>My lord, I think the reason may be this:</line>
<line>My father means to come along with him;</line>
<line>And therefore it is his pleasure he shall stay,</line>
<line>For to attend upon him on the way.</line>
</speech>

<speech>

<stagedir>Enter Ambassador</stagedir>
<line>What news from Gallia? speak ambassador.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>AMBASSADOR.</speaker>
<line>The noble king and queen of Gallia first salutes,</line>
<line>By me, their honourable father, my lord Leir:</line>
<line>Next, they commend them kindly to your graces,</line>
<line>As those whose welfare they entirely wish.</line>
<line>Letters I have to deliver to my lord Leir,</line>
<line>And presents too, if I might speak with him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GONORILL.</speaker>
<line>If you might speak with him? why, do you think,</line>
<line>We are afraid that you should speak with him?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>AMBASSADOR.</speaker>
<line>Pardon me, madam; for I think not so,</line>
<line>But say so only, because he is not here.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CORNWALL.</speaker>
<line>Indeed, my friend, upon some urgent cause,</line>
<line>He is at this time absent from the court:</line>
<line>But if a day or two you here repose,</line>
<line>It is very likely you shall have him here,</line>
<line>Or else have certain notice where he is.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GONORILL.</speaker>
<line>Are not we worthy to receive your message?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>AMBASSADOR.</speaker>
<line>I had in charge to do it to himself.</line>

How doth my sister brook the air of France?</line>

<speaker>AMBASSADOR.</speaker>
<line>Exceeding well, and never sick one hour,</line>

<speech>
<speaker>GONORILL.</speaker>
<line>I am the more sorry.</line>

<line>No, madam, I said quite contrary.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>GONORILL.</speaker>
<line>Then I mistook thee.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>CORNWALL.</speaker>
<line>Then she is merry, if she have her health.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>AMBASSADOR.</speaker>
<line>Oh no, her grief exceeds, until the time,</line>

<speech>
<speaker>GONORILL.</speaker>
<line>Why, her health.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>AMBASSADOR.</speaker>
<line>Amen to that: but god release her grief,</line>

<line>Than to continue always so unkind.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CORNWALL.</speaker>
<line>I will be a mediator in her cause,</line>
<line>And seek all means to expiate his wrath.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>AMBASSADOR.</speaker>
<line>Madam, I hope your grace will do the like.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GONORILL.</speaker>
<line>Should I be a mean to exasperate his wrath</line>
<line>Against my sister, whom I love so dear? no, no.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>AMBASSADOR.</speaker>
<line>To expiate or mitigate his wrath:</line>
<line>For he hath misconceived without a cause.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GONORILL.</speaker>
<line>O, ay, what else?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>AMBASSADOR.</speaker>
<line>It is pity it should be so, would it were otherwise.</line>

<line>It were great pity it should be otherwise.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>AMBASSADOR.</speaker>

<speaker>PERILLUS.</speaker>
<line>She will not be long, I warrant you, my lord:</line>
<line>But say, a couple of these they call good fellows,</line>
<line>Should step out of a hedge, and set upon us,</line>
<line>We were in good case for to answer them.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>It were not for us to stand upon our hands.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PERILLUS.</speaker>
<line>I fear, we scant should stand upon our legs.</line>
<line>But how should we do to defend ourselves?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>Even pray to god, to bless us from their hands:</line>
<line>For fervent prayer much ill hap withstands.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PERILLUS.</speaker>
<line>I will sit and pray with you for company;</line>
<line>Yet was I never so heavy in my life.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>They both fall asleep</stagedir>
<stagedir>Enter the Messenger (murderer), with two daggers in hand</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>MESSENGER.</speaker>
<line>Were it not a mad jest, if two or
three of my profession should meet me, and lay me down in a
ditch, and play rob thief with me, and perforce take my gold
away from me, whilst I act this stratagem, and by this means
the graybeards should escape? faith, when I were at liberty
again, I would make no more to do, but go to the next tree,
and there hang myself.</line>
<stagedir>Sees them, and begins</stagedir> 
<line>But stay, methinks my youths are here already,</line>
<line>And with pure zeal have prayed themselves asleep.</line>
<line>I think, they know to what intent they came,</line>
<line>And are provided for another world.</line>
<stagedir>He takes their books away</stagedir> 
<line>Now could I stab them bravely, while they sleep,</line>
<line>And in a manner put them to no pain;</line>
<line>And doing so, I showed them mighty friendship:</line>
<line>For fear of death is worse than death itself.</line>
<line>But that my sweet queen willed me for to show</line>
<line>This letter to them, ere I did the deed.</line>
<line>Mass, they begin to stir: I will stand aside;</line>
<line>So shall I come upon them unawares.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>They wake and rise</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>I marvel that my daughter stays so long.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PERILLUS.</speaker>
<line>I fear, we did mistake the place, my lord.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>God grant we do not miscarry in the place:</line>
<line>I had a short nap, but so full of dread,</line>
<line>As much amazeth me to think thereof.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PERILLUS.</speaker>
<line>Fear not, my lord, dreams are but fantasies,</line>
<line>And slight imaginations of the brain.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MESSENGER.</speaker>
<line>Persuade him so; but I will make him and you</line>
<line>Confess, that dreams do often prove too true.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PERILLUS.</speaker>
<line>I pray, my lord, what was the effect of it?</line>
<line>I may go near to guess what it portends.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MESSENGER.</speaker>
<line>Leave that to me, I will expound the dream.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>Methought, my daughters, Gonorill and Ragan,</line>
<line>Stood both before me with such grim aspects,</line>
<line>Each brandishing a falchion in their hand,</line>
<line>Ready to lop a limb off where it fell,</line>
<line>And in their other hands a naked poniard,</line>
<line>Wherewith they stabbed me in a hundred places,</line>
<line>And to their thinking left me there for dead:</line>
<line>But then my youngest daughter, fair Cordella,</line>
<line>Came with a box of balsam in her hand,</line>
<line>And poured it into my bleeding wounds,</line>
<line>By whose good means I was recovered well,</line>
<line>In perfect health, as erst I was before:</line>
<line>And with the fear of this I did awake,</line>
<line>And yet for fear my feeble joints do quake.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MESSENGER.</speaker>
<line>I will make you quake for something presently.</line>
<line>Stand, stand.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>They reel</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>We do, my friend, although with much ado.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MESSENGER.</speaker>
<line>Deliver, deliver.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PERILLUS.</speaker>
<line>Deliver us, good lord, from such as he.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MESSENGER.</speaker>
<line>You should have prayed before, while it was time,</line>
<line>And then perhaps, you might have escaped my hands:</line>
<line>But you, like faithful watch-men, fell asleep,</line>
<line>The whilst I came and took your halberds from you.</line>
<stagedir>Shows their books</stagedir> 
<line>And now you want your weapons of defense,</line>
<line>How have you any hope to be delivered?</line>
<line>This comes, because you have no better stay,</line>
<line>But fall asleep, when you should watch and pray.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>My friend, thou seemest to be a proper man.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MESSENGER.</speaker>
<line>'Sblood, how the old slave claws me by the elbow?</line>
<line>He thinks, belike, to escape by scraping thus.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PERILLUS.</speaker>
<line>And it may be, are in some need of money.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MESSENGER.</speaker>
<line>That to be false, behold my evidence.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Shows his purses</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>If that I have will do thee any good,</line>
<line>I give it thee, even with a right good will.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Messenger takes it</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>PERILLUS.</speaker>
<line>Here, take mine too, and wish with all my heart,</line>
<line>To do thee pleasure, it were twice as much.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>The messenger takes his, and weighs both in his hands</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>MESSENGER.</speaker>
<line>I'll none of them, they are too light for me.</line>
</speech>
<stagedir>Puts them in his pocket</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>Why then farewell: and if thou have occasion</line>
<line>In anything, to use me to the queen,</line>
<line>It is like enough that I can pleasure thee.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>They proffer to go</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>MESSENGER.</speaker>
<line>Do you hear, do your hear, sir?</line>
<line>If I had occasion to use you to the queen,</line>
<line>Would you do one thing for me I should ask?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>Ay, anything that lies within my power.</line>
<line>Here is my hand upon it, so farewell.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>proffers to go</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>MESSENGER.</speaker>
<line>Hear you sir, hear you? pray, a word with you.</line>
<line>Methinks, a comely honest ancient man</line>
<line>Should not dissemble with one for a vantage.</line>
<line>I know, when I shall come to try this gear,</line>
<line>You will recant from all that you have said.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PERILLUS.</speaker>
<line>Mistrust not him, but try him when thou wilt:</line>
<line>He is her father, therefore may do much.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MESSENGER.</speaker>
<line>I know he is, and therefore mean to try him:</line>
<line>You are his friend too, I must try you both.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BOTH.</speaker>
<line>Prithee do, prithee do.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>proffer to go out</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>MESSENGER.</speaker>
<line>Stay graybeards then, and prove men of your words:</line>
<line>The queen hath tied me by a solemn oath,</line>
<line>Here in this place to see you both dispatched:</line>
<line>Now for the safeguard of my conscience,</line>
<line>Do me the pleasure for to kill yourselves:</line>
<line>So shall you save me labour for to do it,</line>
<line>And prove yourselves true old men of your words.</line>
<line>And here I vow in sight of all the world,</line>
<line>I never will trouble you whilst I live again.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>Affright us not with terror, good my friend,</line>
<line>Nor strike such fear into our aged hearts.</line>
<line>Play not the cat, which dallieth with the mouse;</line>
<line>And on a sudden maketh her a prey:</line>
<line>But if thou art marked for the man of death</line>
<line>To me and to my Damion, tell me plain,</line>
<line>That we may be prepared for the stroke,</line>
<line>And make ourselves fit for the world to come.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MESSENGER.</speaker>
<line>I am the last of any mortal race,</line>
<line>That ever your eyes are likely to behold,</line>
<line>And hither sent of purpose to this place,</line>
<line>To give a final period to your days,</line>
<line>Which are so wicked, and have lived so long,</line>
<line>That your own children seek to short your life.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>Camest thou from France, of purpose to do this?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MESSENGER.</speaker>
<line>From France? Zounds, do I look like a
Frenchman? sure I have.not mine own face on; somebody hath
changed faces with me, and I know not of it: but I am sure,
my apparel is all English. Sirra, what meanest thou to ask
that question? I could spoil the fashion of this face for
anger. A French face!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>Because my daughter, whom I have offended,</line>
<line>And at whose hands I have deserved as ill,</line>
<line>As ever any father did of child,</line>
<line>Is Queen of France, no thanks at all to me,</line>
<line>But unto god, who my injustice see.</line>
<line>If it be so, that she doth seek revenge,</line>
<line>As with good reason she may justly do,</line>
<line>I will most willingly resign my life,</line>
<line>A sacrifice to mitigate her ire:</line>
<line>I never will entreat thee to forgive,</line>
<line>Because I am unworthy for to live.</line>
<line>Therefore speak soon, and I will soon make speed;</line>
<line>Whether Cordella willed thee do this deed?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MESSENGER.</speaker>
<line>As I am a perfect gentleman, thou speakest French to me:</line>
<line>I never heard Cordella's name before,</line>
<line>Nor never was in France in all my life:</line>
<line>I never knew thou hadst a daughter there,</line>
<line>To whom thou didst prove so unkind a churl:</line>
<line>But thy own tongue declares that thou hast been</line>
<line>A vile old wretch, and full of heinous sin.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>Ah, no, my friend, thou art deceived much:</line>
<line>For her except, whom I confess I wronged,</line>
<line>Through doting frenzy, and over-jealous love.</line>
<line>There lives not any under heaven's bright eye,</line>
<line>That can convict me of impiety.</line>
<line>And therefore sure thou dost mistake the mark:</line>
<line>For I am in true peace with all the world.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MESSENGER.</speaker>
<line>You are the fitter for the king of heaven:</line>
<line>And therefore, for to rid thee of suspense,</line>
<line>Know thou, the Queens of Cambria and Cornwall,</line>
<line>Thy own two daughters, Gonorill and Ragan,</line>
<line>Appointed me to massacre thee here.</line>
<line>Why wouldst thou then persuade me, that thou art</line>
<line>In charity with all the world? but now</line>
<line>When thy own issue hold thee in such hate,</line>
<line>That they have hired me to abridge thy fate,</line>
<line>Oh, fie upon such vile dissembling breath,</line>
<line>That would deceive, even at the point of death.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PERILLUS.</speaker>
<line>Am I awake, or is it but a dream?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MESSENGER.</speaker>
<line>Fear nothing, man, thou art but in a dream,</line>
<line>And thou shalt never wake until doomsday,</line>
<line>By then, I hope, thou wilt have slept enough.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>Yet, gentle friend, grant one thing ere I die.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MESSENGER.</speaker>
<line>I will grant you anything, except your lives.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>Oh, but assure me by some certain token,</line>
<line>That my two daughters hired thee to this deed:</line>
<line>If I were once resolved of that, then I</line>
<line>Would wish no longer life, but crave to die.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MESSENGER.</speaker>
<line>That to be true, in sight of heaven I swear.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>Swear not by heaven, for fear of punishment:</line>
<line>The heavens are guiltless of such heinous acts.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MESSENGER.</speaker>
<line>I swear by earth, the mother of us all.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>Swear not by earth; for she abhors to bear</line>
<line>Such bastards, as are murderers of her sons.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MESSENGER.</speaker>
<line>Why then, by hell, and all the devils I swear.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>Swear not by hell; for that stands gaping wide,</line>
<line>To swallow thee, and if thou do this deed.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Thunder and lightning</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>MESSENGER.</speaker>
<line>I would that word were in his belly again,</line>
<line>It hath frighted me even to the very heart:</line>
<line>This old man is some strong magician:</line>
<line>His words have turned my mind from this exploit.</line>
<line>Then neither heaven, earth, nor hell be witness;</line>
<line>But let this paper witness for them all.</line>
<stagedir>Shows Gonorill's letter</stagedir>
<line>Shall I relent, or shall I prosecute?</line>
<line>Shall I resolve or were I best recant?</line>
<line>I will not crack my credit with two queens,</line>
<line>To whom I have already passed my word.</line>
<line>Oh, but my conscience for this act doth tell,</line>
<line>I get heaven's hate, earth's scorn, and pains of hell.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>They bless themselves</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>PERILLUS.</speaker>
<line>Oh just Jehovah, whose almighty power</line>
<line>Doth govern all things in this spacious world,</line>
<line>How canst thou suffer such outrageous acts</line>
<line>To be committed without just revenge?</line>
<line>O viperous generation and accursed,</line>
<line>To seek his blood, whose blood did make them first!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>Ah, my true friend in all extremity,</line>
<line>Let us submit us to the will of god:</line>
<line>Things past all sense, let us not seek to know;</line>
<line>It is god's will, and therefore must be so.</line>
<line>My friend, I am prepared for the stroke:</line>
<line>Strike when thou wilt, and I forgive thee here,</line>
<line>Even from the very bottom of my heart.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MESSENGER.</speaker>
<line>But I am not prepared for to strike.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>Farewell, Perillus, even the truest friend,</line>
<line>That ever lived in adversity:</line>
<line>The latest kindness I will request of thee,</line>
<line>Is that thou go unto my daughter Cordella,</line>
<line>And carry her her father's latest blessing:</line>
<line>Withal desire her, that she will forgive me;</line>
<line>For I have wronged her without any cause.</line>
<line>Now, lord, receive me, for I come to thee,</line>
<line>And die, I hope, in perfect charity.</line>
<line>Dispatch, I pray thee, I have lived too long.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MESSENGER.</speaker>
<line>Ay, but you are unwise, to send an errand</line>
<line>By him that never meaneth to deliver it:</line>
<line>Why, he must go along with you to heaven:</line>
<line>It were not good you should go all alone.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>No doubt, he shall, when by the course of nature,</line>
<line>He must surrender up his due to death:</line>
<line>But that time shall not come till god permit.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MESSENGER.</speaker>
<line>Nay, presently, to bear you company.</line>
<line>I have a passport for him in my pocket,</line>
<line>Already sealed, and he must needs ride post.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Shows a bag of money</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>The letter which I read, imports not so,</line>
<line>It only toucheth me; no word of him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MESSENGER.</speaker>
<line>Ay, but the queen commands it must be so,</line>
<line>And I am paid for him, as well as you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PERILLUS.</speaker>
<line>I, who have borne you company in life,</line>
<line>Most willingly will bear a share in death.</line>
<line>It skilleth not for me, my friend, a whit,</line>
<line>Nor for a hundred such as thou and I.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MESSENGER.</speaker>
<line>Marry, but it doth, sir, by your leave;
your good days are past:though it be no matter for you, it
is a matter for me, proper men are not so rife.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PERILLUS.</speaker>
<line>Oh, but beware, how thou dost lay thy hand</line>
<line>Upon the high anointed of the Lord:</line>
<line>O, be advised ere thou dost begin:</line>
<line>Dispatch me straight, but meddle not with him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>Friend, thy commission is to deal with me,</line>
<line>And I am he that hath deserved all:</line>
<line>The plot was laid to take away my life:</line>
<line>And here it is, I do entreat thee take it:</line>
<line>Yet for my sake, and as thou art a man,</line>
<line>Spare this my friend, that hither with me came:</line>
<line>I brought him forth, whereas he had not been,</line>
<line>But for good-will to bear me company.</line>
<line>He left his friends, his country and his goods,</line>
<line>And came with me in most extremity.</line>
<line>Oh, if he should miscarry here and die,</line>
<line>Who is the cause of it, but only I?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MESSENGER.</speaker>
<line>Why that am I, let that never trouble thee.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>O no, 'tis I. O, had I now to give thee</line>
<line>The monarchy of all the spacious world</line>
<line>To save his life, I would bestow it on thee:</line>
<line>But I have nothing but these tears and prayers,</line>
<line>And the submission of a bended knee.</line>
<stagedir>kneels</stagedir> 
<line>O, if all this to mercy move thy mind,</line>
<line>Spare him, in heaven thou shalt like mercy find.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MESSENGER.</speaker>
<line>I am as hard to be moved as another, and yet methinks the</line>
<line>Strength of their persuasions stirs me a little.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PERILLUS.</speaker>
<line>My friend, if fear of the almighty power</line>
<line>Have power to move thee, we have said enough:</line>
<line>But if thy mind be moveable with gold,</line>
<line>We have not presently to give it thee:</line>
<line>Yet to thyself thou mayest do greater good,</line>
<line>To keep thy hands still undefiled from blood:</line>
<line>For do but well consider with thyself,</line>
<line>When thou hast finished this outrageous act,</line>
<line>What horror still will haunt thee for the deed:</line>
<line>Think this again, that they which would incense</line>
<line>Thee for to be the butcher of their father,</line>
<line>When it is done, for fear it should be known,</line>
<line>Would make a means to rid thee from the world:</line>
<line>Oh, then art thou forever tied in chains</line>
<line>Of everlasting torments to endure,</line>
<line>Even in the hottest hole of grisly hell,</line>
<line>Such pains, as never mortal tongue can tell.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>It thunders, he quakes and lets fall the dagger next to Perillus.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>O, heavens be thanked, he will spare my friend.</line>
<line>Now when thou wilt come make an end of me.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>He lets fall the other dagger.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>PERILLUS.</speaker>
<line>Oh, happy fight! he means to save my lord.</line>
<line>The king of heaven continue this good mind.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>Why stayest thou to do execution?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MESSENGER.</speaker>
<line>I am as willful as you for your life</line>
<line>I will not do it, now you do entreat me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PERILLUS.</speaker>
<line>Ah, now I see thou hast some spark of grace.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MESSENGER.</speaker>
<line>Beshrew you for it, you have put it in me:</line>
<line>The parlousest old men, that ever I heard.</line>
<line>Well, to be flat, I will not meddle with you:</line>
<line>Here I found you, and here I will leave you:</line>
<line>If any ask you why the case so stands?</line>
<line>Say that your tongues were better than your hands.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit. Dresse</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>PERILLUS.</speaker>
<line>Farewell. If ever we together meet,</line>
<line>It shall go hard, but I will thee regreet.</line>
<line>Courage, my lord, the worst is overpast;</line>
<line>Let us give thanks to God, and hie us hence.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>Thou art deceived; for I am past the best,</line>
<line>And know not whither for to go from hence:</line>
<line>Death had been better welcome unto me,</line>
<line>Than longer life to add more misery.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PERILLUS.</speaker>
<line>It were not good to return from whence we came,</line>
<line>Unto your daughter Ragan back again.</line>
<line>Now let us go to France, unto Cordella,</line>
<line>Your youngest daughter, doubtless she will succour you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>Oh, how can I persuade myself of that,</line>
<line>Since the other two are quite devoid of love;</line>
<line>To whom I was so kind, as that my gifts,</line>
<line>Might make them love, if it were nothing else?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PERILLUS.</speaker>
<line>No worldly gifts, but grace from God on high,</line>
<line>Doth nourish virtue and true charity.</line>
<line>Remember well what words Cordella spake,</line>
<line>What time you asked her, how she loved your grace,</line>
<line>She said, her love unto you was as much,</line>
<line>As ought a child to bear unto her father.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>But she did find, my love was not to her,</line>
<line>As should a father bear unto a child.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PERILLUS.</speaker>
<line>That makes her love not to be any less,</line>
<line>If she do love you as a child should do:</line>
<line>You have tried two, try one more for my sake,</line>
<line>I will never entreat you further trial make.</line>
<line>Remember well the dream you had of late,</line>
<line>And think what comfort it foretells to us.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>Come, truest friend, that ever man possessed,</line>
<line>I know thou counsellest all things for the best:</line>
<line>If this third daughter play a kinder part,</line>
<line>It comes of God, and not of my desert.</line>

<stagedir>Enter the Gallian Ambassador, solus.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>AMBASSADOR.</speaker>
<line>There is of late news come unto the court,</line>
<line>That old lord Leir remains in Cambria:</line>
<line>I will hie me thither presently, to impart</line>
<line>My letters and my message unto him.</line>
<line>I never was less welcome to a place</line>
<line>In all my lifetime, than I have been hither,</line>
<line>Especially unto the stately queen,</line>
<line>Who would not cast one gracious look on me,</line>
<line>But still with lowering and suspicious eyes,</line>
<line>Would take exceptions at each word I spake,</line>
<line>And fain she would have undermined me,</line>
<line>To know what my ambassage did import:</line>
<line>But she is like to hop without her hope,</line>
<line>Though, by report, shall have it in all things else.</line>
<line>Well, I will post away for Cambria:</line>
<line>Within these few days I hope to be there.</line>

<stagedir>Enter the king and queen of Gallia, and Mumford.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<line>By this, our father understands our mind,</line>
<line>And our kind greetings sent to him of late:</line>
<line>Therefore my mind presageth ere it be long,</line>
<line>We shall receive from Britain happy news.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CORDELLA.</speaker>
<line>I fear, my sister will dissuade his mind;</line>
<line>For she to me hath always been unkind.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<line>Fear not, my love, since that we know the worst,</line>
<line>The last means helps, if that we miss the first:</line>
<line>If he will not come to Gallia unto us,</line>
<line>Then we will sail to Britain unto him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MUMFORD.</speaker>
<line>Well, if I once see Britain again, I have
sworn, I will never come home without my wench, and I will
not be forsworn, I will rather never come home while I
live.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CORDELLA.</speaker>
<line>Are you sure, Mumford, she is a maid still?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MUMFORD.</speaker>
<line>Nay, I will not swear she is a maid, but she
goes for one: I will take her at all adventures, if I can
get her.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CORDELLA.</speaker>
<line>Ay, that is well put in.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MUMFORD.</speaker>
<line>Well put in? Nay, it was ill put in; for had
it been as well put in, as ever I put in, in my days, I
would have made her follow me to France.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CORDELLA.</speaker>
<line>Nay, you would have been so kind, as take
her with you, or else, were I as she, I would have been so
loving, as I would stay behind you: Yet I must confess, you
are a very proper man, and able to make a wench do more than
she would do.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MUMFORD.</speaker>
<line>Well, I have a pair of slops for the nonce,</line>
<line>Will hold all your mocks.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<line>Nay, we see you have a handsome hose.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CORDELLA.</speaker>
<line>Ay, and of the newest fashion.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MUMFORD.</speaker>
<line>More bobs, more: put them in still, they
will serve instead of bombast, yet put not in too many, lest
the seams crack, and they fly out amongst you again: You
must not think to outface me so easily in my mistress'
quarrel, who if I see once again, ten team of horses shall
not draw me away, till I have full and whole possession.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<line>Ay, but one team and a cart will serve the turn.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CORDELLA.</speaker>
<line>Not only for him, but also for his wench.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MUMFORD.</speaker>
<line>Well, you are two to one, I will give you over:</line>
<line>And since I see you so pleasantly disposed,</line>
<line>Which indeed is but seldom seen, I will claim</line>
<line>A promise of you, which you shall not deny me:</line>
<line>For promise is debt, and by this hand you promised it me.</line>
<line>Therefore you owe it me, and you shall pay it me,</line>
<line>Or I will sue you upon an action of unkindness.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<line>Prithee, lord Mumford, what promise did I make thee?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MUMFORD.</speaker>
<line>Faith, nothing but this,</line>
<line>That the next fair weather, which is very now,</line>
<line>You would go in progress down to the seaside,</line>
<line>Which is very near.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<line>Faith, in this motion I will join with thee,</line>
<line>And be a mediator to my queen.</line>
<line>Prithee, my love, let this match go forward,</line>
<line>My mind foretells, it will be a lucky voyage.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CORDELLA.</speaker>
<line>Entreaty needs not, where you may command,</line>
<line>So you be pleased, I am right well content;</line>
<line>Yet, as the sea I much desire to see;</line>
<line>So am I most unwilling to be seen.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<line>We will go disguised, all unknown to any.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CORDELLA.</speaker>
<line>Howsoever you make one, I will make another.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MUMFORD.</speaker>
<line>And I the third: oh, I am over-joyed!</line>
<line>See what love is, which getteth with a word,</line>
<line>What all the world besides could never obtain!</line>
<line>But what disguises shall we have, my lord?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<line>Faith thus: my queen and I will be disguised,</line>
<line>Like a plain country couple, and you shall be Roger,</line>
<line>Our man, and wait upon us: or if you will,</line>
<line>You shall go first, and we will wait on you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MUMFORD.</speaker>
<line>It were more than time; this device is excellent.</line>
<line>Come let us about it.</line>

<scenetitle>Scene II</scenetitle>

<stagedir>Enter Cambria and Ragan with nobles.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>CAMBRIA.</speaker>
<line>What strange mischance or unexpected hap</line>
<line>Hath thus deprived us of our father's presence?</line>
<line>Can no man tell us what is become of him,</line>
<line>With whom we did converse not two days since?</line>
<line>My lords, let everywhere light horse be sent,</line>
<line>And scour about through all our regiment.</line>
<line>Dispatch a post immediately to Cornwall,</line>
<line>To see if any news be of him there;</line>
<line>Myself will make a strict enquiry here,</line>
<line>And all about our cities near at hand,</line>
<line>Till certain news of his abode be brought.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>RAGAN.</speaker>
<line>All sorrow is but counterfeit to mine,</line>
<line>Whose lips are almost sealed up with grief:</line>
<line>Mine is the substance, whilst they do but seem</line>
<line>To weep the loss, which tears cannot redeem.</line>
<line>O, never was heard so strange a misadventure,</line>
<line>A thing so far beyond the reach of sense,</line>
<line>Since no man's reason in the cause can enter.</line>
<line>What hath removed my father thus from hence?</line>
<line>O, I do fear some charm or invocation</line>
<line>Of wicked spirits, or infernal fiends,</line>
<line>Stirred by Cordella, moves this innovation,</line>
<line>And brings my father timeless to his end.</line>
<line>But might I know, that the detested witch</line>
<line>Were certain cause of this uncertain ill,</line>
<line>Myself to France would go in some disguise,</line>
<line>And with these nails scratch out her hateful eyes:</line>
<line>For since I am deprived of my father,</line>
<line>I loath my life, and wish my death the rather.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CAMBRIA.</speaker>
<line>The heavens are just, and hate impiety,</line>
<line>And will, no doubt, reveal such heinous crimes:</line>
<line>Censure not any, till you know the right:</line>
<line>Let him be judge, that bringeth truth to light.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>RAGAN.</speaker>
<line>O, but my grief, like to a swelling tide,</line>
<line>Exceeds the bounds of common patience:</line>
<line>Nor can I moderate my tongue so much,</line>
<line>To conceal them, whom I hold in suspect.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CAMBRIA.</speaker>
<line>This matter shall be sifted: if it be she,</line>
<line>A thousand Frances shall not harbour her.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>AMBASSADOR.</speaker>
<line>All happiness unto the Cambrian king.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CAMBRIA.</speaker>
<line>Welcome, my friend, from whence is thy Ambassage?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>AMBASSADOR.</speaker>
<line>I came from Gallia, unto Cornwall sent,</line>
<line>With letters to your honourable father,</line>
<line>Whom there not finding, as I did expect,</line>
<line>I was directed hither to repair.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>RAGAN.</speaker>
<line>Frenchman, what is thy message to my father?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>AMBASSADOR.</speaker>
<line>My letters, madam, will import the same,</line>
<line>Which my commission is for to deliver.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>RAGAN.</speaker>
<line>In his absence you may trust us with your letters.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>AMBASSADOR.</speaker>
<line>I must perform my charge in such a manner,</line>
<line>As I have strict commandment from the king.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>RAGAN.</speaker>
<line>There is good packing betwixt your king and you:</line>
<line>You need not hither come to ask for him,</line>
<line>You know where he is better than ourselves.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>AMBASSADOR.</speaker>
<line>Madam, I hope not far off.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>RAGAN.</speaker>
<line>Hath the young murderess, your outrageous queen,</line>
<line>No means to colour her detested deeds,</line>
<line>In finishing my guiltless father's days,</line>
<line>Because he gave her nothing to her dower</line>
<line>But by the colour of a feigned Ambassage,</line>
<line>To send him letters hither to our court?</line>
<line>Go carry them to them that sent them hither,</line>
<line>And bid them keep their scrolls unto themselves:</line>
<line>They cannot blind us with such slight excuse,</line>
<line>To smother up so monstrous vile abuse.</line>
<line>And were it not, it is against law of arms,</line>
<line>To offer violence to a messenger,</line>
<line>We would inflict such torments on thyself,</line>
<line>As should enforce thee to reveal the truth.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>AMBASSADOR.</speaker>
<line>Madam, your threats no whit appal my mind,</line>
<line>I know my conscience guiltless of this act;</line>
<line>My king and queen, I dare be sworn, are free</line>
<line>From any thought of such impiety:</line>
<line>And therefore, madam, you have done them wrong,</line>
<line>And ill-beseeming with a sister's love,</line>
<line>Who in mere duty tender him as much,</line>
<line>As ever you respected him for dower.</line>
<line>The king your husband will not say as much.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CAMBRIA.</speaker>
<line>I will suspend my judgment for a time,</line>
<line>Till more appearance give us further light:</line>
<line>Yet to be plain, your coming doth enforce</line>
<line>A great suspicion to our doubtful mind,</line>
<line>And that you do resemble, to be brief,</line>
<line>Him that first robs, and then cries, 'Stop the thief.'</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>AMBASSADOR.</speaker>
<line>Pray God some near you have not done the like.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>RAGAN.</speaker>
<line>Hence, saucy mate, reply no more to us;</line>
<stagedir>She strikes him</stagedir>
<line>For law of arms shall not protect thy tongue.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>AMBASSADOR.</speaker>
<line>Never was I offered such discourtesy;</line>
<line>God and my king, I trust, ere it be long,</line>
<line>Will find a mean to remedy this wrong.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit Amb.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>RAGAN.</speaker>
<line>How shall I live, to suffer this disgrace,</line>
<line>At every base and vulgar peasant's hands?</line>
<line>It ill befitteth my imperial state,</line>
<line>To be thus used, and no man take my part.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>She weeps</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>CAMBRIA.</speaker>
<line>What should I do? infringe the law of arms,</line>
<line>Were to my everlasting obloquy:</line>
<line>But I will take revenge upon his master,</line>
<line>Which sent him hither, to delude us thus.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>RAGAN.</speaker>
<line>Nay, if you put up this, be sure, ere long,</line>
<line>Now that my father thus is made away,</line>
<line>She will come and claim a third part of your crown,</line>
<line>As due unto her by inheritance.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CAMBRIA.</speaker>
<line>But I will prove her title to be nought</line>
<line>But shame, and the reward of parricide,</line>
<line>And make her an example to the world,</line>
<line>For after-ages to admire her penance.</line>
<line>This will I do, as I am Cambria's king,</line>
<line>Or lose my life, to prosecute revenge.</line>
<line>Come, first let us learn what news is of our father,</line>
<line>And then proceed, as best occasion fits.</line>

<scenetitle>Scene III</scenetitle>

<stagedir>Enter Leir, Perillus, and two mariners in sea-gowns and sea-caps.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>PERILLUS.</speaker>
<line>My honest friends, we are ashamed to show</line>
<line>The great extremity of our present state,</line>
<line>In that at this time we are brought so low,</line>
<line>That we want money for to pay our passage.</line>
<line>The truth is so, we met with some good fellows,</line>
<line>A little before we came aboard your ship,</line>
<line>Which stripped us quite of all the coin we had,</line>
<line>And left us not a penny in our purses:</line>
<line>Yet wanting money, we will use the mean,</line>
<line>To see you satisfied to the uttermost.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FIRST MARINER.</speaker>
<line>Here is a good gown, it would become me passing well, I should be fine in it.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Look on Leir</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>SECOND MARINER.</speaker>
<line>Here is a good cloak, I marvel how I should look in it.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Look on Perillus.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>Faith, had we others to supply their room,</line>
<line>Though never so mean, you willingly should have them.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FIRST MARINER.</speaker>
<line>Do you hear, sir? you look like an
honest man; I will not stand to do you a pleasure: here is a
good strong motley gabardine, cost me fourteen good
shillings at billingsgate, give me your gown for it, and
your cap for mine, and I will forgive your passage.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>With all my heart, and twenty thanks.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Lear and he changeth</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>SECOND MARINER.</speaker>
<line>Do you hear, sir? you shall have
a better match than he, because you are my friend: here is a
good sheep's russet sea-gown, will bide more stress, I
warrant you, than two of his, yet for you seem to be an
honest gentleman, I am content to change it for your cloak,
and ask you nothing for your passage more. </line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Pulls off Perillus' cloak</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>PERILLUS.</speaker>
<line>My own I willingly would change with thee,</line>
<line>And think myself indebted to thy kindness:</line>
<line>But would my friend might keep his garment still.</line>
<line>My friend, I will give thee this new doublet, if thou wilt</line>
<line>Restore his gown unto him back again.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FIRST MARINER.</speaker>
<line>Nay, if I do, would I might never eat
powdered beef and mustard more, nor drink can of good liquor
whilst I live. My friend, you have small reason to seek to
hinder me of my bargain: but the best is, a bargain's a
bargain.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<stagedir>To Perillus</stagedir> 
<line>Kind friend, it is much better as it is.</line>
<line>For by this means we may escape unknown,</line>
<line>Till time and opportunity do fit.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SECOND MARINER.</speaker>
<line>Hark, hark, they are laying their heads together,</line>
<line>They'll repent them of their bargain anon,</line>
<line>'Twere best for us to go while we are well.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FIRST MARINER.</speaker>
<line>God be with you, sir, for your passage back again,</line>
<line>I will use you as unreasonable as another.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>I know thou wilt; but we hope to bring ready money.</line>
<line>With us, when we come back again.</line>
<stagedir>Exeunt Mariners</stagedir> 
<line>Were ever men in this extremity,</line>
<line>In a strange country, and devoid of friends,</line>
<line>And not a penny for to help ourselves?</line>
<line>Kind friend, what thinkest thou will become of us?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PERILLUS.</speaker>
<line>Be of good cheer, my lord, I have a doublet</line>
<line>Will yield us money enough to serve our turns,</line>
<line>Until we come unto your daughter's court:</line>
<line>And then, I hope, we shall find friends enough.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>Ah, kind Perillus, that is it I fear,</line>
<line>And makes me faint, or ever I come there.</line>
<line>Can kindness spring out of ingratitude?</line>
<line>Or love be reaped, where hatred hath been sown?</line>
<line>Can henbane join in league with Mithridate?</line>
<line>Or sugar grow in wormwood's bitter stalk?</line>
<line>It cannot be, they are too opposite:</line>
<line>And so am I to any kindness here.</line>
<line>I have thrown wormwood on the sugared youth,</line>
<line>And like to henbane poisoned the fount,</line>
<line>Whence flowed the Mithridate of a child's good will:</line>
<line>I, like an envious thorn, have pricked the heart,</line>
<line>And turned sweet grapes, to sour unrelished sloes:</line>
<line>The causeless ire of my respectless breast,</line>
<line>Hath soured the sweet milk of dame nature's paps:</line>
<line>My bitter words have galled her honey thoughts,</line>
<line>And weeds of rancour choked the flower of grace.</line>
<line>Then what remainder is of any hope,</line>
<line>But all our fortunes will go quite aslope?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PERILLUS.</speaker>
<line>Fear not, my lord, the perfect good indeed,</line>
<line>Can never be corrupted by the bad:</line>
<line>A new fresh vessel still retains the taste</line>
<line>And therefore, though you name yourself the thorn,</line>
<line>The weed, the gall, the henbane and the wormwood;</line>
<line>Yet she will continue in her former state,</line>
<line>The honey, milk, grape, sugar, Mithridate.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>Thou pleasing orator unto me in woe,</line>
<line>Cease to beguile me with thy hopeful speeches:</line>
<line>O join with me, and think of nought but crosses,</line>
<line>And then we will one lament another's losses.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PERILLUS.</speaker>
<line>Why, say the worst, the worst can be but death,</line>
<line>And death is better than for to despair:</line>
<line>Then hazard death, which may convert to life;</line>
<line>Banish despair, which brings a thousand deaths.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>Overcome with thy strong arguments, I yield,</line>
<line>To be directed by thee, as thou wilt:</line>
<line>As thou yieldest comfort to my crazed thoughts,</line>
<line>Would I could yield the like unto thy body,</line>
<line>Which is full weak, I know, and ill apaid,</line>
<line>For want of fresh meat and due sustenance.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PERILLUS.</speaker>
<line>Alack, my lord, my heart doth bleed, to think</line>
<line>That you should be in such extremity.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>Come, let us go, and see what god will send;</line>
<line>When all means fail, he is the surest friend.</line>

<stagedir>Enter the Gallian king and queen, and Mumford with a basket, disguised like country folk.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<line>This tedious journey all on foot, sweet love,</line>
<line>Cannot be pleasing to your tender joints,</line>
<line>Which never were used to these toilsome walks.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CORDELLA.</speaker>
<line>I never in my life took more delight</line>
<line>In any journey, than I do in this:</line>
<line>It did me good, whenas we happed to light</line>
<line>Amongst the merry crew of country folk,</line>
<line>To see what industry and pains they took,</line>
<line>To win them commendations amongst their friends.</line>
<line>Lord, how they labour to bestir themselves,</line>
<line>And in their quirks to go beyond the moon,</line>
<line>And so take on them with such antic fits,</line>
<line>That one would think they were beside their wits!</line>
<line>Come away, Roger, with your basket.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MUMFORD.</speaker>
<line>Soft, dame, here comes a couple of old youths,</line>
<line>I must needs make myself fat with jesting at them.</line>

<line>Nay, prithee do not, they do seem to be</line>
<stagedir>Enter Lear and Perillus very faintly</stagedir>
<line>Men much overcome with grief and misery.</line>
<line>Let's stand aside, and hearken what they say.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>Ah, my Perillus, now I see we both</line>
<line>Shall end our days in this unfruitful soil.</line>
<line>Oh, I do faint for want of sustenance:</line>
<line>And thou, I know, in little better case.</line>
<line>No gentle tree affords one taste of fruit,</line>
<line>To comfort us, until we meet with men:</line>
<line>No lucky path conducts our luckless steps</line>
<line>Unto a place where any comfort dwells.</line>
<line>Sweet rest betide unto our happy souls;</line>
<line>For here I see our bodies must have end.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PERILLUS.</speaker>
<line>Ah, my dear lord, how doth my heart lament,</line>
<line>To see you brought to this extremity!</line>
<line>Oh, if you love me, as you do profess,</line>
<line>Or ever thought well of me in my life;</line>
<stagedir>He strips up his arm</stagedir>
<line>Feed on this flesh, whose veins are not so dry,</line>
<line>But there is virtue left to comfort you.</line>
<line>Oh, feed on this, if this will do you good,</line>
<line>I will smile for joy, to see you suck my blood.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>I am no cannibal, that I should delight</line>
<line>To slake my hungry jaws with human flesh:</line>
<line>I am no devil, or ten times worse than so,</line>
<line>To suck the blood of such a peerless friend.</line>
<line>O, do not think that I respect my life</line>
<line>So dearly, as I do thy loyal love.</line>
<line>Ah, Britain, I shall never see thee more,</line>
<line>That hast unkindly banished thy king:</line>
<line>And yet not thou dost make me to complain,</line>
<line>But they which were more near to me than thou.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CORDELLA.</speaker>
<line>What do I hear? this lamentable voice,</line>
<line>Methinks, ere now I oftentimes have heard.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>Ah, Gonorill, was half my kingdom's gift</line>
<line>The cause that thou didst seek to have my life?</line>
<line>Ah, cruel Ragan, did I give thee all,</line>
<line>And all could not suffice without my blood?</line>
<line>Ah, poor Cordella, did I give thee nought,</line>
<line>Nor never shall be able for to give?</line>
<line>O, let me warn all ages that ensueth,</line>
<line>How they trust flattery, and reject the truth.</line>
<line>Well, unkind girls, I here forgive you both,</line>
<line>Yet the just heavens will hardly do the like;</line>
<line>And only crave forgiveness at the end</line>
<line>Of good Cordella, and of thee, my friend;</line>
<line>Of God, whose majesty I have offended,</line>
<line>By my transgression many thousand ways:</line>
<line>Of her, dear heart, whom I for no occasion</line>
<line>Turned out of all, through flatterer's persuasion;</line>
<line>Of thee, kind friend, who but for me, I know,</line>
<line>Had'st never come unto this place of woe.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>CORDELLA.</speaker>
<line>O, but some meat, some meat: do you not see,</line>
<line>How near they are to death for want of food?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PERILLUS.</speaker>
<line>Lord, which didst help thy servants at their need,</line>
<line>Or now or never send us help with speed.</line>
<line>Oh comfort, comfort! yonder is a banquet,</line>
<line>And men and women, my lord: be of good cheer;</line>
<line>For I see comfort coming very near.</line>
<line>O my lord, a banquet, and men and women!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>O, let kind pity mollify their hearts,</line>
<line>That they may help us in our great extremes.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PERILLUS.</speaker>
<line>God save you, friends; and if this blessed banquet</line>
<line>Affordeth any food or sustenance,</line>
<line>Even for his sake that saved us all from death,</line>
<line>Vouchsafe to save us from the grip of famine.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>She brings him to the table</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>CORDELLA.</speaker>
<line>Here father, sit and eat, here, sit and drink:</line>
<line>And would it were far better for your sakes.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Perillus takes Leir by the hand to the table</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>PERILLUS.</speaker>
<line>I will give you thanks anon: my friend doth faint,</line>
<line>And needeth present comfort.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Leir drinks</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>MUMFORD.</speaker>
<line>I warrant, he never stays to say a grace:</line>
<line>O, there is no sauce to a good stomach.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PERILLUS.</speaker>
<line>The blessed God of heaven hath thought upon us.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>The thanks be his, and these kind courteous folk,</line>
<line>By whose humanity we are preserved.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>They eat hungrily, Lear drinks</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>CORDELLA.</speaker>
<line>And may that draught be unto him, as was</line>
<line>That which old Eson drank, which did renew</line>
<line>His withered age, and made him young again.</line>
<line>And may that meat be unto him, as was</line>
<line>That which Elias ate, in strength whereof</line>
<line>He walked forty days, and never fainted.</line>
<line>Shall I conceal me longer from my father?</line>
<line>Or shall I manifest myself to him?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<line>Forbear awhile, until his strength return,</line>
<line>Lest being overjoyed with seeing thee,</line>
<line>His poor weak senses should forsake their office,</line>
<line>And so our cause of joy be turned to sorrow.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PERILLUS.</speaker>
<line>What cheer, my lord? how do you feel yourself?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>Methinks, I never ate such savoury meat:</line>
<line>It is as pleasant as the blessed Manna,</line>
<line>That rained from heaven amongst the Israelites:</line>
<line>It hath recalled my spirits home again,</line>
<line>And made me fresh, as erst I was before.</line>
<line>But how shall we congratulate their kindness?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PERILLUS.</speaker>
<line>In faith, I know not how sufficiently;</line>
<line>But the best mean that I can think on, is this:</line>
<line>I will offer them my doublet in requital;</line>
<line>For we have nothing else to spare.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>Nay, stay, Perillus, for they shall have mine.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PERILLUS.</speaker>
<line>Pardon, my lord, I swear they shall have mine.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Perillus offers his doublet. They will not take it.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>Ah, who would think such kindness should remain</line>
<line>Among such strange and unacquainted men:</line>
<line>And that such hate should harbour in the breast</line>
<line>Of those, which have occasion to be best?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CORDELLA.</speaker>
<line>Ah, good old father, tell to me thy grief,</line>
<line>I will sorrow with thee, if not add relief.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>Ah, good young daughter, I may call thee so;</line>
<line>For thou art like a daughter I did owe.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CORDELLA.</speaker>
<line>Do you not owe her still? what, is she dead?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>No, god forbid: but all my interest is gone,</line>
<line>By showing myself too much unnatural:</line>
<line>So have I lost the title of a father,</line>
<line>And may be called a stranger to her rather.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CORDELLA.</speaker>
<line>Your title is good still; for it is always known,</line>
<line>A man may do as him list with his own.</line>
<line>But have you but one daughter then in all?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>Yes, I have more by two, than would I had.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CORDELLA.</speaker>
<line>O, say not so, but rather see the end:</line>
<line>They that are bad, may have the grace to mend:</line>
<line>But how have they offended you so much?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>If from the first I should relate the cause,</line>
<line>It would make a heart of adamant to weep;</line>
<line>And thou, poor soul, kind-hearted as thou art,</line>
<line>Dost weep already, ere I do begin.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CORDELLA.</speaker>
<line>For god's love tell it, and when you have done,</line>
<line>I will tell the reason why I weep so soon.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>Then know this first, I am a Briton born,</line>
<line>And had three daughters by one loving wife:</line>
<line>And though I say it, of beauty they were sped;</line>
<line>Especially the youngest of the three,</line>
<line>For her perfections hardly matched could be:</line>
<line>On these I doted with a jealous love,</line>
<line>And thought to try which of them loved me best,</line>
<line>By asking them, which would do most for me?</line>
<line>The first and second flattered me with words,</line>
<line>And vowed they loved me better than their lives:</line>
<line>The youngest said, she loved me as a child</line>
<line>Might do: her answer I esteemed most vile,</line>
<line>And presently in an outrageous mood,</line>
<line>I turned her from me to go sink or swim:</line>
<line>And all I had, even to the very clothes,</line>
<line>I gave in dowry with the other two:</line>
<line>And she that best deserved the greatest share,</line>
<line>I gave her nothing, but disgrace and care.</line>
<line>Now mark the sequel: when I had done thus,</line>
<line>I sojourned in my eldest daughter's house,</line>
<line>Where for a time I was entreated well,</line>
<line>And lived in state sufficing my content:</line>
<line>But every day her kindness did grow cold,</line>
<line>Which I with patience put up well enough,</line>
<line>And seemed not to see the things I saw:</line>
<line>But at the last she grew so far incensed</line>
<line>With moody fury, and with causeless hate,</line>
<line>That in most vile and contumelious terms,</line>
<line>She bade me pack, and harbour somewhere else.</line>
<line>Then was I fain for refuge to repair</line>
<line>Unto my other daughter for relief,</line>
<line>Who gave me pleasing and most courteous words;</line>
<line>But in her actions showed herself so sore,</line>
<line>As never any daughter did before:</line>
<line>She prayed me in a morning out betime,</line>
<line>To go to a thicket two miles from the court,</line>
<line>Pointing that there she would come talk with me:</line>
<line>There she had set a shag-haired murdering wretch,</line>
<line>To massacre my honest friend and me.</line>
<line>Then judge yourself, although my tale be brief,</line>
<line>If ever man had greater cause of grief.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<line>Nor never like impiety was done,</line>
<line>Since the creation of the world begun.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>And now I am constrained to seek relief</line>
<line>Of her, to whom I have been so unkind;</line>
<line>Whose censure, if it do award me death,</line>
<line>I must confess she pays me but my due:</line>
<line>But if she show a loving daughter's part,</line>
<line>It comes of god and her, not my desert.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CORDELLA.</speaker>
<line>No doubt she will, I dare be sworn she will.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>How know you that, not knowing what she is?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CORDELLA.</speaker>
<line>Myself a father have a great way hence,</line>
<line>Used me as ill as ever you did her;</line>
<line>Yet, that his reverend age I once might see,</line>
<line>I would creep along, to meet him on my knee.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>O, no men's children are unkind but mine.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CORDELLA.</speaker>
<line>Condemn not all, because of others' crime:</line>
<line>But look, dear father, look, behold and see</line>
<line>Thy loving daughter speaketh unto thee.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>she kneels</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>Oh, stand thou up, it is my part to kneel,</line>
<line>And ask forgiveness for my former faults.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>he kneels</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>CORDELLA.</speaker>
<line>Oh, if you wish, I should enjoy my breath,</line>
<line>Dear father rise, or I receive my death.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>he rises</stagedir>
<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>Then I will rise to satisfy your mind,</line>
<line>But kneel again, till pardon be resigned.</line>
</speech>
<stagedir>he kneels</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>CORDELLA.</speaker>
<line>I pardon you: the word beseems not me:</line>
<line>But I do say so, for to ease your knee.</line>
<line>You gave me life, you were the cause that I</line>
<line>Am what I am, who else had never been.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>But you gave life to me and to my friend,</line>
<line>Whose days had else had an untimely end.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CORDELLA.</speaker>
<line>You brought me up, whenas I was but young,</line>
<line>And far unable for to help myself.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>I cast thee forth, whenas thou was but young,</line>
<line>And far unable for to help thyself.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CORDELLA.</speaker>
<line>God, world and nature say I do you wrong,</line>
<line>That can endure to see you kneel so long.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<line>Let me break off this loving controversy,</line>
<line>Which doth rejoice my very soul to see.</line>
<line>Good father, rise, she is your loving daughter,</line>
<stagedir>he rises</stagedir>
<line>And honours you with as respective duty,</line>
<line>As if you were the monarch of the world.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CORDELLA.</speaker>
<line>But I will never rise from off my knee,</line>
<stagedir>she kneels</stagedir>
<line>Until I have your blessing, and your pardon</line>
<line>Of all my faults committed anyway,</line>
<line>From my first birth unto this present day.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>The blessing, which the God of Abraham gave</line>
<line>Unto the tribe of Judah, light on thee,</line>
<line>And multiply thy days, that thou mayest see</line>
<line>Thy children's children prosper after thee.</line>
<line>Thy faults, which are just none that I do know,</line>
<line>God pardon on high, and I forgive below. </line>
</speech>

<stagedir>she rises</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>CORDELLA.</speaker>
<line>Now is my heart at quiet, and doth leap</line>
<line>Within my breast, for joy of this good hap:</line>
<line>And now, dear father, welcome to our court,</line>
<line>And welcome, kind Perillus, unto me,</line>
<line>Mirror of virtue and true honesty.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>O, he hath been the kindest friend to me,</line>
<line>That ever man had in adversity.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PERILLUS.</speaker>
<line>My tongue doth fail, to say what heart doth think,</line>
<line>I am so ravished with exceeding joy.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<line>All you have spoke: now let me speak my mind,</line>
<line>And in few words much matter here conclude:</line>
<stagedir>he kneels</stagedir>
<line>If ever my heart do harbour any joy,</line>
<line>Or true content repose within my breast,</line>
<line>Till I have rooted out this viperous sect,</line>
<line>And repossessed my father of his crown,</line>

<stagedir>he kneels</stagedir>
<line>If ere I resalute the British earth,</line>
<line>(As, ere't be long, I do presume I shall)</line>
<line>And so return from thence without my wench,</line>
<line>Let me be gelded for my recompense.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>RAGAN.</speaker>
<line>I feel a hell of conscience in my breast,</line>
<line>Tormenting me with horror for my fact,</line>
<line>And makes me in a agony of doubt,</line>
<line>For fear the world should find my dealing out.</line>
<line>The slave whom I appointed for the act,</line>
<line>I never set eye upon the peasant since:</line>
<line>O, could I get him for to make him sure,</line>
<line>My doubts would cease, and I should rest secure.</line>
<line>But if the old men, with persuasive words,</line>
<line>Have saved their lives, and made him to relent;</line>
<line>Then are they fled unto the court of France,</line>
<line>And like a trumpet manifest my shame.</line>
<line>A shame on these white-livered slaves, say I,</line>
<line>That with fair words so soon are overcome.</line>
<line>O god, that I had been but made a man;</line>
<line>Or that my strength were equal with my will!</line>
<line>These foolish men are nothing but mere pity,</line>
<line>And melt as butter doth against the sun.</line>
<line>Why should they have pre-eminence over us,</line>
<line>Since we are creatures of more brave resolve?</line>
<line>I swear, I am quite out of charity</line>
<line>With all the heartless men in Christendom.</line>
<line>A pox upon them, when they are afraid</line>
<line>To give a stab, or slit a paltry wind-pipe,</line>
<line>Which are so easy matters to be done.</line>
<line>Well, had I thought the slave would serve me so,</line>
<line>Myself would have been executioner:</line>
<line>It is now undone, and if that it be known,</line>
<line>I will make as good shift as I can for one.</line>
<line>He that repines at me, however it stands,</line>
<line>T'were best for him to keep him from my hands.</line>

<line>Thus have we brought our army to the sea,</line>

<line>The wind stands fair, and we in four hours' sail,</line>
<line>May easily arrive on British shore,</line>
<line>Where unexpected we may them surprise,</line>
<line>And gain a glorious victory with ease.</line>
<line>Wherefore, my loving countrymen, resolve,</line>
<line>Since truth and justice fighteth on our sides,</line>
<line>That we shall march with conquest where we go.</line>
<line>Myself will be as forward as the first,</line>
<line>And step by step march with the hardiest wight:</line>
<line>And not the meanest soldier in our camp</line>
<line>Shall be in danger, but I will second him.</line>
<line>To you, my lord, we give the whole command</line>
<line>Of all the army, next unto ourself;</line>
<line>Not doubting of you, but you will extend</line>
<line>Your wonted valour in this needful case,</line>
<line>Encouraging the rest to do the like,</line>
<line>By your approved magnanimity.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MUMFORD.</speaker>
<line>My liege, 'tis needless to spur a willing horse,</line>
<line>That's apt enough to run himself to death:</line>
<line>For here I swear by that sweet saint's bright eyes,</line>
<line>Which are the stars, which guide me to good hap,</line>
<line>Either to see my old lord crowned anew,</line>
<line>Or in his cause to bid the world adieu.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>Thanks, good lord Mumford, it is more of your good-will,</line>
<line>Than any merit or desert in me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MUMFORD.</speaker>
<line>And now to you, my worthy countrymen,</line>
<line>Ye valiant race of Genovestan Gauls,</line>
<line>Surnamed Red-shanks, for your chivalry,</line>
<line>Because you fight up to the shanks in blood;</line>
<line>Show yourselves now to be right Gauls indeed,</line>
<line>And be so bitter on your enemies,</line>
<line>That they may say, you are as bitter as gall.</line>
<line>Gall them, brave shot, with your artillery:</line>
<line>Gall them, brave halberts, with your sharp point bills,</line>
<line>Each in their appointed place, not one, but all,</line>
<line>Fight for the credit of yourselves and Gaul.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<line>Then what should more persuasion need to those,</line>
<line>That rather wish to deal, than hear of blows?</line>
<line>Let us to our ships, and if that god permit,</line>
<line>In four hours' sail, I hope we shall be there.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>CAPTAIN.</speaker>
<line>My honest friends, it is your turn tonight,</line>
<line>To watch in this place, near about the beacon,</line>
<line>And vigilantly have regard,</line>
<line>If any fleet of ships pass hitherward:</line>
<line>Which if you do, your office is to fire</line>
<line>The beacon presently, and raise the town.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>FIRST WATCHMAN.</speaker>
<line>Ay, ay, ay, fear nothing; we know our
charge, I warrant: I have been a watchman about this beacon
this thirty year, and yet I never see it stir, but stood as
quietly as might be.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SECOND WATCHMAN.</speaker>
<line>Faith neighbour, and you will follow
my advice, instead of watching the beacon, we will go to
goodmanGeniting's, and watch a pot of ale and a rasher of
bacon: and if we do not drink ourselves drunk, then so; I
warrant, the beacon will see us when we come out again.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FIRST WATCHMAN.</speaker>
<line>Ay, but how if somebody excuse us to the captain?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SECOND WATCHMAN.</speaker>
<line>'Tis no matter, I will prove by good reason that we watch the beacon: ass for example.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FIRST WATCHMAN.</speaker>
<line>I hope you do not call me ass by craft, neighbour.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SECOND WATCHMAN.</speaker>
<line>No, no, but for example: say here stands the pot of ale, that is the beacon.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FIRST WATCHMAN.</speaker>
<line>Ay, ay, it is a very good beacon.</line>
</speech>

<speech>

<line>Well, say here stands your nose, that is the fire.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>FIRST WATCHMAN.</speaker>
<line>Indeed I must confess, it is somewhat red.</line>
</speech>

<speaker>SECOND WATCHMAN.</speaker>
<line>I see come marching in a dish, half a score pieces of salt bacon.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FIRST WATCHMAN.</speaker>
<line>I understand your meaning, that is as much to say, half a score ships.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SECOND WATCHMAN.</speaker>
<line>True, you conster right; presently,
like a faithful watchman, I fire the beacon, and call up the
town.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FIRST WATCHMAN.</speaker>
<line>Ay, that is as much as to say, you set your nose to the pot, and drink up the drink.</line>

go fire the beacon.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<line>Fear not, my friends, you shall receive no hurt,</line>
<line>If you will subscribe unto your lawful king,</line>
<line>And quite revoke your fealty from Cambria,</line>
<line>And from aspiring Cornwall too, whose wives</line>
<line>Have practised treason against their father's life.</line>
<line>We come in justice of your wronged king,</line>
<line>And do intend no harm at all to you,</line>
<line>So you submit unto your lawful king.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>Kind countrymen, it grieves me, that perforce,</line>
<line>I am constrained to use extremities.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NOBLES.</speaker>
<line>Long have you here been looked for, good my lord,</line>
<line>And wished for by a general consent:</line>
<line>And had we known your highness had arrived,</line>
<line>We had not made resistance to your grace:</line>
<line>And now, my gracious lord, you need not doubt,</line>
<line>But all the country will yield presently,</line>
<line>Which since your absence have been greatly taxed,</line>
<line>For to maintain their overswelling pride.</line>
<line>We will presently send word to all our friends;</line>
<line>When they have notice, they will come apace.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>Thanks, loving subjects; and thanks, worthy son,</line>
<line>Thanks, my kind daughter, thanks to you, my lord,</line>
<line>Who willingly adventured have your blood,</line>
<line>(Without desert) to do me so much good.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MUMFORD.</speaker>
<line>Oh, say not so:</line>
<line>I have been much beholding to your grace:</line>
<line>I must confess, I have been in some skirmishes,</line>
<line>But I was never in the like to this:</line>
<line>For where I was wont to meet with armed men,</line>
<line>I was now encountered with naked women.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CORDELLA.</speaker>
<line>We that are feeble, and want use of arms,</line>
<line>Will pray to god, to shield you from all harms.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>The while your hands do manage ceaseless toil,</line>
<line>Our hearts shall pray, the foes may have the foil.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PERILLUS.</speaker>
<line>We will fast and pray, whilst you for us do fight,</line>
<line>That victory may prosecute the right.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<line>Methinks, your words do amplify (my friends)</line>
<line>And add fresh vigour to my willing limbs:</line>
<stagedir>drum</stagedir> 
<line>But hark, I hear the adverse drum approach.</line>
<line>God and our right, Saint Denis, and Saint George.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Cornwall, Cambria, Gonorill, Ragan and the army</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>CORNWALL.</speaker>
<line>Presumptuous king of Gauls, how darest thou</line>
<line>Presume to enter on our British shore?</line>
<line>And more than that, to take our towns perforce,</line>
<line>And draw our subjects' hearts from their true king?</line>
<line>Be sure to buy it at as dear a price,</line>
<line>As ever you bought presumption in your lives.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<line>Over-daring Cornwall, know, we came in right,</line>
<line>And just revengement of the wronged king,</line>
<line>Whose daughters there, fell vipers as they are,</line>
<line>Have sought to murder and deprive of life:</line>
<line>But god protected him from all their spite,</line>
<line>And we are come in justice of his right.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CAMBRIA.</speaker>
<line>Nor he nor thou have any interest here,</line>
<line>But what you win and purchase with the sword.</line>
<line>Thy slanders to our noble virtuous queens,</line>
<line>We will in the battle thrust them down thy throat,</line>
<line>Except for fear of our revenging hands,</line>
<line>Thou fly to sea, as not secure on lands.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MUMFORD.</speaker> 
<line>Welshman, I will so ferret you ere night for that word,</line>
<line>That you shall have no mind to crake so well this
twelvemonth.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GONORILL.</speaker>
<line>They lie, that say, we sought our father's death.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>RAGAN.</speaker>
<line>It is merely forged for a colour's sake,</line>
<line>To set a gloss on your invasion.</line>
<line>Methinks, an old man ready for to die,</line>
<line>Should be ashamed to broach so foul a lie.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CORDELLA.</speaker> 
<line>Fie, shameless sister, so devoid of grace,</line>
<line>To call our father liar to his face.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GONORILL.</speaker>
<line>Peace, puritan, dissembling hypocrite,</line>
<line>Which art so good, that thou wilt prove stark naught:</line>
<line>Anon, whenas I have you in my fingers,</line>
<line>I will make you wish yourself in purgatory.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PERILLUS.</speaker>
<line>Nay, peace thou monster, shame unto thy sex:</line>
<line>Thou fiend in likeness of a human creature.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>RAGAN.</speaker>
<line>I never heard a fouler spoken man.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>Out on thee, viper, scum, filthy parricide,</line>
<line>More odious to my sight than is a toad.</line>
<line>Knowest thou these letters?</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>She snatches them &amp; tears them.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>RAGAN.</speaker>
<line>Think you to outface me with your paltry scrolls?</line>
<line>You come to drive my husband from his right,</line>
<line>Under the colour of a forged letter.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>Who ever heard the like impiety?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PERILLUS.</speaker>
<line>You are our debtor of more patience:</line>
<line>We were more patient when we stayed for you,</line>
<line>Within the thicket two long hours and more.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>RAGAN.</speaker>
<line>What hours? what thicket?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PERILLUS.</speaker>
<line>There, where you sent your servant with your letters,</line>
<line>Sealed with your hand, to send us both to heaven,</line>
<line>Where as I think, you never mean to come.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>RAGAN.</speaker>
<line>Alas, you are grown a child again with age,</line>
<line>Or else your senses dote for want of sleep.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PERILLUS.</speaker>
<line>Indeed you made us rise betimes, you know,</line>
<line>Yet had a care we should sleep where you bade us stay,</line>
<line>But never wake more till the latter day.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GONORILL.</speaker>
<line>Peace, peace, old fellow, thou art sleepy still.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MUMFORD.</speaker>
<line>Faith, and if you reason till tomorrow,</line>
<line>You get no other answer at their hands.</line>
<line>It is pity two such good faces</line>
<line>Should have so little grace between them.</line>
<line>Well, let us see if their husbands with their hands,</line>
<line>Can do as much, as they do with their tongues.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CAMBRIA.</speaker>
<line>Ay, with their swords they will make your tongue unsay</line>
<line>What they have said, or else they will cut them out.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<line>To it, gallants, to it, let us not stand brawling thus.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exeunt both armies.</stagedir>

</scene>

<scene>
<scenetitle>Scene XI</scenetitle>

<stagedir>Sound Alarum: excursions. Mumford must chase Cambria away: then cease. Enter Cornwall.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>CORNWALL.</speaker>
<line>The day is lost, our friends do all revolt,</line>
<line>And join against us with the adverse part:</line>
<line>There is no means of safety but by flight,</line>
<line>And therefore I will to Cornwall with my queen.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit</stagedir>
<stagedir>Enter Cambria</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>CAMBRIA.</speaker>
<line>I think, there is a devil in the camp hath haunted</line>
<line>Me today: he hath so tired me, that in a manner I can fight no more.</line>
<stagedir>Enter Mumford</stagedir>
<line>Zounds, here he comes, I will take me to my horse.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit. Mumford follows him to the door, and returns.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>MUMFORD.</speaker>
<line>Farewell, Welshman, give thee but thy due,</line>
<line>Thou hast a light and nimble pair of legs:</line>
<line>Thou art more in debt to them than to thy hands:</line>
<line>But if I meet thee once again today,</line>
<line>I will cut them off, and set them to a better heart.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit.</stagedir>

</scene>

<scene>
<scenetitle>Scene XII</scenetitle>

<stagedir>Alarum and excursions; then sound victory. Enter Leir, Perillus, King, Cordella, and Mumford.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<line>Thanks be to god, your foes are overcome,</line>
<line>And you again possessed of your right.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>First to the heavens, next, thanks to you, my son,</line>
<line>By whose good means I repossess the same:</line>
<line>Which if it please you to accept yourself,</line>
<line>With all my heart I will resign to you.</line>
<line>For it is yours by right, and none of mine.</line>
<line>First, have you raised, at your own charge, a power</line>
<line>Of valiant soldiers; this comes all from you;</line>
<line>Next have you ventured your own person's scathe.</line>
<line>And lastly worthy Gallia never stained,</line>
<line>My kingly title I by thee have gained.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<line>Thank heavens, not me, my zeal to you is such,</line>
<line>Command my utmost I will never grutch.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CORDELLA.</speaker>
<line>He that with all kind love entreats his queen,</line>
<line>Will not be to her father unkind seen.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEIR.</speaker>
<line>Ah, my Cordella, now I call to mind,</line>
<line>The modest answer, which I took unkind:</line>
<line>But now I see, I am no whit beguiled,</line>
<line>Thou lovedst me dearly, and as ought a child.</line>
<line>And thou, Perillus, partner once in woe,</line>
<line>Thee to requite, the best I can, I will do:</line>
<line>Yet all I can, ay, were it never so much,</line>
<line>Were not sufficient, thy true love is such.</line>
<line>Thanks, worthy Mumford, to thee last of all,</line>
<line>Not greeted last, because thy desert was small;</line>
<line>No, thou hast lion-like laid on today,</line>
<line>Chasing the Cornwall king and Cambria;</line>
<line>Who with my daughters, daughters did I say?</line>
<line>To save their lives, the fugitives did play.</line>
<line>Come, son and daughter, who did me advance,</line>
<line>Repose with me awhile, and then for France.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Sound drums and trumpets. Exeunt.</stagedir>
