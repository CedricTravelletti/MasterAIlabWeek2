<line>If you shall chance, Camillo, to visit Bohemia on the like occasion whereon my services are now on foot, you shall see (as I have said) great difference betwixt our Bohemia and your Sicilia.</line>

<speaker long="Archidamus">ARCH.</speaker>
<line>Verily, I speak it in the freedom of my knowledge: we cannot with such magnificence&#8212;in so rare&#8212;I know not what to say&#8212;We will give you sleepy drinks, that your senses (unintelligent of our insufficience) may, though they cannot praise us, as little accuse us.</line>

<line>You pay a great deal too dear for what&#8217;s given freely.</line>

<line>Believe me, I speak as my understanding instructs me, and as mine honesty puts it to utterance.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Camillo">CAM.</speaker>
<line>Sicilia cannot show himself overkind to Bohemia. They were train&#8217;d together in their childhoods; and there rooted betwixt them then such an affection, which cannot choose but branch now. Since their more mature dignities and royal necessities made separation of their society, their encounters (though not personal) hath been royally attorney&#8217;d with interchange of gifts, letters, loving embassies, that they have seem&#8217;d to be together, though absent; shook hands, as over a vast; and embrac&#8217;d as it were from the ends of oppos&#8217;d winds. The heavens continue their loves!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Archidamus">ARCH.</speaker>
<line>I think there is not in the world either malice or matter to alter it. You have an unspeakable comfort of your young prince Mamillius: it is a gentleman of the greatest promise that ever came into my note.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Camillo">CAM.</speaker>
<line>I very well agree with you in the hopes of him; it is a gallant child; one that, indeed, physics the subject, makes old hearts fresh. They that went on crutches ere he was born desire yet their life to see him a man.</line>

<line>Would they else be content to die?</line>

But to make an end of the ship, to see how the sea flap-dragon&#8217;d it; but, first, how the poor souls roar&#8217;d, and the sea mock&#8217;d them; and how the poor gentleman roar&#8217;d, and the bear mock&#8217;d him, both roaring louder than the sea or weather.</line>

<line>It is fifteen years since I saw my country; though I have for the most part been air&#8217;d abroad, I desire to lay my bones there.

<line>As thou lov&#8217;st me, Camillo, wipe not out the rest of thy services by leaving me now. The need I have of thee, thine own goodness hath made. Better not to have had thee than thus to want thee. Thou, having made me businesses which none without thee can sufficiently manage, must either stay to execute them thyself, or take away with thee the very services thou hast done; which if I have not enough consider&#8217;d (as too much I cannot), to be more thankful to thee shall be my study, and my profit therein the heaping friendships. Of that fatal country Sicilia, prithee speak no more, whose very naming punishes me with the remembrance of that penitent (as thou call&#8217;st him) and reconcil&#8217;d king, my brother, whose loss of his most precious queen and children are even now to be afresh lamented. Say to me, when saw&#8217;st thou the Prince Florizel, my son?

<line>Sir, it is three days since I saw the Prince. What his happier affairs may be, are to me unknown; but I have (missingly) noted, he is of late much retir&#8217;d from court, and is less frequent to his princely exercises than formerly he hath appear&#8217;d.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Polixenes, King of Bohemia">POL.</speaker>
<line>I have consider&#8217;d so much, Camillo, and with some care, so far that I have eyes under my service which look upon his removedness; from whom I have this intelligence, that he is seldom from the house of a most homely shepherd, a man, they say, that from very nothing, and beyond the imagination of his neighbors, is grown into an unspeakable estate.</line>

<line>That&#8217;s likewise part of my intelligence; but (I fear) the angle that plucks our son thither.

<line>O master! If you did but hear the pedlar at the door, you would never dance again after a tabor and pipe; no, the bagpipe could not move you. He sings several tunes faster than you&#8217;ll tell money; he utters them as he had eaten ballads and all men&#8217;s ears grew to his tunes.</line>

They throng who should buy first, as if my trinkets had been hallow&#8217;d and brought a benediction to the buyer; by which means I saw whose purse was best in picture, and what I saw, to my good use I rememb&#8217;red. My clown (who wants but something to be a reasonable man) grew so in love with the wenches&#8217; song, that he would not stir his pettitoes till he had both tune and words, which so drew the rest of the herd to me that all their other senses stuck in ears. You might have pinch&#8217;d a placket, it was senseless; &#8217;twas nothing to geld a codpiece of a purse; I would have fil&#8217;d keys off that hung in chains. No hearing, no feeling, but my sir&#8217;s song, and admiring the nothing of it. So that in this time of lethargy I pick&#8217;d and cut most of their festival purses; and had not the old man come in with a whoobub against his daughter and the King&#8217;s son, and scar&#8217;d my choughs from the chaff, I had not left a purse alive in the whole army.</line>

But what talk we of these traitorly rascals, whose miseries are to be smil&#8217;d at, their offenses being so capital? Tell me (for you seem to be honest plain men) what you have to the King. Being something gently consider&#8217;d, I&#8217;ll bring you where he is aboard, tender your persons to his presence, whisper him in your behalfs; and if it be in man besides the King to effect your suits, here is man shall do it.</line>

<speaker long="First Gentleman">1. GENT.</speaker>
<line>I was by at the opening of the fardel, heard the old shepherd deliver the manner how he found it; whereupon, after a little amazedness, we were all commanded out of the chamber; only this, methought, I heard the shepherd say, he found the child.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Autolycus">AUT.</speaker>
<line>I would most gladly know the issue of it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="First Gentleman">1. GENT.</speaker>
<line>I make a broken delivery of the business; but the changes I perceiv&#8217;d in the King and Camillo were very notes of admiration. They seem&#8217;d almost, with staring on one another, to tear the cases of their eyes. There was speech in their dumbness, language in their very gesture; they look&#8217;d as they had heard of a world ransom&#8217;d, or one destroy&#8217;d. A notable passion of wonder appear&#8217;d in them; but the wisest beholder, that knew no more but seeing, could not say if th&#8217; importance were joy or sorrow; but in the extremity of the one, it must needs be.</line>

<speaker long="Second Gentleman">2. GENT.</speaker>
<line>Nothing but bonfires. The oracle is fulfill&#8217;d; the King&#8217;s daughter is found. Such a deal of wonder is broken out within this hour that ballad-makers cannot be able to express it.</line>

<line>Here comes the Lady Paulina&#8217;s steward, he can deliver you more. How goes it now, sir? This news, which is call&#8217;d true, is so like an old tale, that the verity of it is in strong suspicion. Has the King found his heir?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Third Gentleman">3. GENT.</speaker>
<line>Most true, if ever truth were pregnant by circumstance. That which you hear you&#8217;ll swear you see, there is such unity in the proofs. The mantle of Queen Hermione&#8217;s; her jewel about the neck of it; the letters of Antigonus found with it, which they know to be his character; the majesty of the creature in resemblance of the mother; the affection of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding; and many other evidences proclaim her, with all certainty, to be the King&#8217;s daughter. Did you see the meeting of the two kings?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Second Gentleman">2. GENT.</speaker>
<line>No.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Third Gentleman">3. GENT.</speaker>
<line>Then have you lost a sight which was to be seen, cannot be spoken of. There might you have beheld one joy crown another, so and in such manner that it seem&#8217;d sorrow wept to take leave of them, for their joy waded in tears. There was casting up of eyes, holding up of hands, with countenance of such distraction that they were to be known by garment, not by favor. Our king, being ready to leap out of himself for joy of his found daughter, as if that joy were now become a loss, cries, &#8220;O, thy mother, thy mother!&#8221;; then asks Bohemia forgiveness; then embraces his son-in-law; then again worries he his daughter with clipping her. Now he thanks the old shepherd, which stands by like a weather-bitten conduit of many kings&#8217; reigns. I never heard of such another encounter, which lames report to follow it, and undoes description to do it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Second Gentleman">2. GENT.</speaker>
<line>What, pray you, became of Antigonus, that carried hence the child?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Third Gentleman">3. GENT.</speaker>
<line>Like an old tale still, which will have matter to rehearse, though credit be asleep and not an ear open: he was torn to pieces with a bear. This avouches the shepherd&#8217;s son, who has not only his innocence (which seems much) to justify him, but a handkerchief and rings of his that Paulina knows.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="First Gentleman">1. GENT.</speaker>
<line>What became of his bark and his followers?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Third Gentleman">3. GENT.</speaker>
<line>Wrack&#8217;d the same instant of their master&#8217;s death, and in the view of the shepherd; so that all the instruments which aided to expose the child were even then lost when it was found. But O, the noble combat that &#8217;twixt joy and sorrow was fought in Paulina! She had one eye declin&#8217;d for the loss of her husband, another elevated that the oracle was fulfill&#8217;d. She lifted the Princess from the earth, and so locks her in embracing, as if she would pin her to her heart, that she might no more be in danger of losing.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="First Gentleman">1. GENT.</speaker>
<line>The dignity of this act was worth the audience of kings and princes, for by such was it acted.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Third Gentleman">3. GENT.</speaker>
<line>One of the prettiest touches of all, and that which angled for mine eyes (caught the water though not the fish), was when, at the relation of the Queen&#8217;s death (with the manner how she came to&#8217;t bravely confess&#8217;d and lamented by the King), how attentiveness wounded his daughter, till (from one sign of dolor to another) she did (with an &#8220;Alas!&#8221;), I would fain say, bleed tears; for I am sure my heart wept blood. Who was most marble there chang&#8217;d color; some swounded, all sorrow&#8217;d. If all the world could have seen&#8217;t, the woe had been universal.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="First Gentleman">1. GENT.</speaker>
<line>Are they return&#8217;d to the court?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Third Gentleman">3. GENT.</speaker>
<line>No. The Princess hearing of her mother&#8217;s statue, which is in the keeping of Paulina&#8212;a piece many years in doing and now newly perform&#8217;d by that rare Italian master, Julio Romano, who, had he himself eternity and could put breath into his work, would beguile Nature of her custom, so perfectly he is her ape. He so near to Hermione hath done Hermione that they say one would speak to her and stand in hope of answer. Thither with all greediness of affection are they gone, and there they intend to sup.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Second Gentleman">2. GENT.</speaker>
<line>I thought she had some great matter there in hand, for she hath privately twice or thrice a day, ever since the death of Hermione, visited that remov&#8217;d house. Shall we thither, and with our company piece the rejoicing?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="First Gentleman">1. GENT.</speaker>

<line offset="6">Her natural posture!</line>
<line>Chide me, dear stone, that I may say indeed</line>
<line>Thou art Hermione; or rather, thou art she</line>
<line>In thy not chiding; for she was as tender</line>
<line>As infancy and grace. But yet, Paulina,</line>
<line>Hermione was not so much wrinkled, nothing</line>
<line offset="0">So aged as this seems.</line>

<line offset="4">O, not by much.</line>
</speech>

<speech>

<line>So much the more our carver&#8217;s excellence,</line>
<line>Which lets go by some sixteen years, and makes her</line>
<line offset="0">As she liv&#8217;d now.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Leontes, King of Sicilia">LEON.</speaker>
<line offset="4">As now she might have done,</line>
<line>So much to my good comfort as it is</line>
<line>Now piercing to my soul. O, thus she stood,</line>
<line>Even with such life of majesty (warm life,</line>
<line>As now it coldly stands), when first I woo&#8217;d her!</line>
<line>I am asham&#8217;d; does not the stone rebuke me</line>
<line>For being more stone than it? O royal piece,</line>
<line>There&#8217;s magic in thy majesty, which has</line>
<line>My evils conjur&#8217;d to remembrance, and</line>
<line>From thy admiring daughter took the spirits,</line>
<line offset="0">Standing like stone with thee.</line>
</speech>

<speaker long="Perdita">PER.</speaker>
<line offset="6">And give me leave,</line>
<line>And do not say &#8217;tis superstition, that</line>

<line>The statue is but newly fix&#8217;d; the color&#8217;s</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Camillo">CAM.</speaker>
<line>My lord, your sorrow was too sore laid on,</line>
<line>Which sixteen winters cannot blow away,</line>
<line>So many summers dry. Scarce any joy</line>
<line>Did ever so long live; no sorrow</line>
<line offset="0">But kill&#8217;d itself much sooner.</line>

<speech>
<speaker long="Polixenes, King of Bohemia">POL.</speaker>

<line>The very life seems warm upon her lip.</line>

<line>The fixure of her eye has motion in&#8217;t,</line>

<line>No settled senses of the world can match</line>

<line>I am sorry, sir, I have thus far stirr&#8217;d you; but</line>
<line offset="0">I could afflict you farther.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Leontes, King of Sicilia">LEON.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Do, Paulina;</line>
<line>For this affliction has a taste as sweet</line>
<line>As any cordial comfort. Still methinks</line>
<line>There is an air comes from her. What fine chisel</line>
<line>Could ever yet cut breath? Let no man mock me,</line>
<line offset="0">For I will kiss her.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Paulina">PAUL.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Good my lord, forbear.</line>
<line>The ruddiness upon her lip is wet;</line>
<line>You&#8217;ll mar it if you kiss it; stain your own</line>
<line>With oily painting. Shall I draw the curtain?</line>

<line offset="5">Either forbear,</line>
<line>Quit presently the chapel, or resolve you</line>
<line>For more amazement. If you can behold it,</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll make the statue move indeed, descend,</line>
<line>And take you by the hand; but then you&#8217;ll think</line>
<line>(Which I protest against) I am assisted</line>
<line offset="0">By wicked powers.</line>
</speech>

<speaker long="Leontes, King of Sicilia">LEON.</speaker>
<line offset="4">What you can make her do,</line>
<line>I am content to look on; what to speak,</line>
<line>I am content to hear; for &#8217;tis as easy</line>

<line>Thou shouldst a husband take by my consent,</line>

<line>But how, is to be question&#8217;d; for I saw her</line>

<line>A prayer upon her grave. I&#8217;ll not seek far</line>
<line>(For him, I partly know his mind) to find thee</line>
<line>An honorable husband. Come, Camillo,</line>
<line>And take her by the hand, whose worth and honesty</line>
<line>Is richly noted; and here justified</line>
<line>By us, a pair of kings. Let&#8217;s from this place.</line>
