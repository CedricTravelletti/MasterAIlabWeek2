<line number="1" form="verse">So shaken as we are, so wan with care,</line>
<line number="2" form="verse">Find we a time for frighted peace to pant</line>
<line number="3" form="verse">And breathe short-winded accents of new broils</line>
<line number="4" form="verse">To be commenc&#8217;d in stronds afar remote.</line>
<line number="5" form="verse">No more the thirsty entrance of this soil</line>
<line number="6" form="verse">Shall daub her lips with her own children&#8217;s blood,</line>
<line number="7" form="verse">No more shall trenching war channel her fields,</line>
<line number="8" form="verse">Nor bruise her flow&#8217;rets with the armed hoofs</line>
<line number="9" form="verse">Of hostile paces. Those opposed eyes,</line>
<line number="10" form="verse">Which, like the meteors of a troubled heaven,</line>
<line number="11" form="verse">All of one nature, of one substance bred,</line>
<line number="12" form="verse">Did lately meet in the intestine shock</line>
<line number="13" form="verse">And furious close of civil butchery,</line>
<line number="14" form="verse">Shall now, in mutual well-beseeming ranks,</line>
<line number="15" form="verse">March all one way and be no more oppos&#8217;d</line>
<line number="16" form="verse">Against acquaintance, kindred, and allies.</line>
<line number="17" form="verse">The edge of war, like an ill-sheathed knife,</line>
<line number="18" form="verse">No more shall cut his master. Therefore, friends,</line>
<line number="19" form="verse">As far as to the sepulchre of Christ&#8212;</line>
<line number="20" form="verse">Whose soldier now, under whose blessed cross</line>
<line number="21" form="verse">We are impressed and engag&#8217;d to fight&#8212;</line>
<line number="22" form="verse">Forthwith a power of English shall we levy,</line>
<line number="23" form="verse">Whose arms were moulded in their mother&#8217;s womb,</line>
<line number="24" form="verse">To chase these pagans in those holy fields,</line>
<line number="25" form="verse">Over whose acres walk&#8217;d those blessed feet</line>
<line number="26" form="verse">Which fourteen hundred years ago were nail&#8217;d</line>
<line number="27" form="verse">For our advantage on the bitter cross.</line>
<line number="28" form="verse">But this our purpose now is twelve month old,</line>
<line number="29" form="verse">And bootless &#8217;tis to tell you we will go;</line>
<line number="30" form="verse">Therefore we meet not now. Then let me hear</line>
<line number="31" form="verse">Of you, my gentle cousin Westmorland,</line>
<line number="32" form="verse">What yesternight our Council did decree</line>
<line number="33" form="verse">In forwarding this dear expedience.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Earl of Westmorland">WEST.</speaker>
<line number="34" form="verse">My liege, this haste was hot in question.</line>
<line number="35" form="verse">And many limits of the charge set down</line>
<line number="36" form="verse">But yesternight, when all athwart there came</line>
<line number="37" form="verse">A post from Wales loaden with heavy news,</line>
<line number="38" form="verse">Whose worst was that the noble Mortimer,</line>
<line number="39" form="verse">Leading the men of Herfordshire to fight</line>
<line number="40" form="verse">Against the irregular and wild Glendower,</line>
<line number="41" form="verse">Was by the rude hands of that Welshman taken,</line>
<line number="42" form="verse">A thousand of his people butchered,</line>
<line number="43" form="verse">Upon whose dead corpse&#8217; there was such misuse,</line>
<line number="44" form="verse">Such beastly shameless transformation,</line>
<line number="45" form="verse">By those Welshwomen done as may not be</line>
<line number="46" form="verse">Without much shame retold or spoken of.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="King Henry IV">KING.</speaker>
<line number="47" form="verse">It seems then that the tidings of this broil</line>
<line number="48" form="verse">Brake off our business for the Holy Land.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Earl of Westmorland">WEST.</speaker>
<line number="49" form="verse">This match&#8217;d with other did, my gracious lord,</line>
<line number="50" form="verse">For more uneven and unwelcome news</line>
<line number="51" form="verse">Came from the north, and thus it did import:</line>
<line number="52" form="verse">On Holy-rood day, the gallant Hotspur there,</line>
<line number="53" form="verse">Young Harry Percy, and brave Archibald,</line>
<line number="54" form="verse">That ever-valiant and approved Scot,</line>
<line number="55" form="verse">At Holmedon met,</line>
<line number="56" form="verse">Where they did spend a sad and bloody hour,</line>
<line number="57" form="verse">As by discharge of their artillery</line>
<line number="58" form="verse">And shape of likelihood the news was told;</line>
<line number="59" form="verse">For he that brought them, in the very heat</line>
<line number="60" form="verse">And pride of their contention did take horse,</line>
<line number="61" form="verse">Uncertain of the issue any way.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="King Henry IV">KING.</speaker>
<line number="62" form="verse">Here is a dear, a true industrious friend,</line>
<line number="63" form="verse">Sir Walter Blunt, new lighted from his horse,</line>
<line number="64" form="verse">Stain&#8217;d with the variation of each soil</line>
<line number="65" form="verse">Betwixt that Holmedon and this seat of ours;</line>
<line number="66" form="verse">And he hath brought us smooth and welcome news.</line>
<line number="67" form="verse">The Earl of Douglas is discomfited:</line>
<line number="68" form="verse">Ten thousand bold Scots, two and twenty knights,</line>
<line number="69" form="verse">Balk&#8217;d in their own blood, did Sir Walter see</line>
<line number="70" form="verse">On Holmedon&#8217;s plains. Of prisoners, Hotspur took</line>
<line number="71" form="verse">Mordake Earl of Fife and eldest son</line>
<line number="72" form="verse">To beaten Douglas, and the Earl of Athol,</line>
<line number="73" form="verse">Of Murray, Angus, and Menteith.</line>
<line number="74" form="verse">And is not this an honorable spoil?</line>
<line number="75" form="verse">A gallant prize? Ha, cousin, is it not?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Earl of Westmorland">WEST.</speaker>
<line number="76" form="verse">In faith,</line>

<line number="78" form="verse">Yea, there thou mak&#8217;st me sad, and mak&#8217;st me sin</line>
<line number="79" form="verse">In envy that my Lord Northumberland</line>
<line number="80" form="verse">Should be the father to so blest a son&#8212;</line>
<line number="81" form="verse"> A son who is the theme of honor&#8217;s tongue,</line>
<line number="82" form="verse">Amongst a grove the very straightest plant,</line>
<line number="83" form="verse">Who is sweet Fortune&#8217;s minion and her pride,</line>
<line number="84" form="verse">Whilst I, by looking on the praise of him,</line>
<line number="85" form="verse">See riot and dishonor stain the brow</line>
<line number="86" form="verse">Of my young Harry. O that it could be prov&#8217;d</line>
<line number="87" form="verse">That some night-tripping fairy had exchang&#8217;d</line>
<line number="88" form="verse">In cradle-clothes our children where they lay,</line>
<line number="89" form="verse">And call&#8217;d mine Percy, his Plantagenet!</line>
<line number="90" form="verse">Then would I have his Harry and he mine.</line>
<line number="91" form="verse">But let him from my thoughts. What think you, coz,</line>
<line number="92" form="verse">Of this young Percy&#8217;s pride? The prisoners</line>
<line number="93" form="verse">Which he in this adventure hath surpris&#8217;d</line>
<line number="94" form="verse">To his own use he keeps, and sends me word</line>
<line number="95" form="verse">I shall have none but Mordake Earl of Fife.</line>

<line number="96" form="verse">This is his uncle&#8217;s teaching; this is Worcester,</line>
<line number="97" form="verse">Malevolent to you in all aspects,</line>

Have I not all their letters to meet me in arms by the ninth of the next month? And are they not some of them set forward already? What a pagan rascal is this! An infidel! Ha, you shall see now in very sincerity of fear and cold heart will he to the King, and lay open all our proceedings. O, I could divide myself and go to buffets, for moving such a dish of skim-milk with so honorable an action! Hang him! Let him tell the King: we are prepar&#8217;d. I will set forward tonight.</line>

Sirrah, I am sworn brother to a leash of drawers, and can call them all by their christen names, as Tom, Dick, and Francis. They take it already upon their salvation, that though I be but Prince of Wales, yet I am the king of courtesy, and tell me flatly I am no proud Jack like Falstaff, but a Corinthian, a lad of mettle, a good boy (by the Lord, so they call me!), and when I am King of England I shall command all the good lads in Eastcheap. They call drinking deep, dyeing scarlet, and when you breathe in your watering, they cry &#8220;hem!&#8221; and bid you play it off. To conclude, I am so good a proficient in one quarter of an hour, that I can drink with any tinker in his own language during my life. I tell thee, Ned, thou hast lost much honor that thou wert not with me in this action. But, sweet Ned&#8212;to sweeten which name of Ned, I give thee this pennyworth of sugar, clapp&#8217;d even now into my hand by an under-skinker, one that never spake other English in his life than &#8220;Eight shillings and sixpence,&#8221; and &#8220;You are welcome,&#8221; with this shrill addition, &#8220;Anon, anon, sir! Score a pint of bastard in the Half-moon,&#8221; or so. But, Ned, to drive away the time till Falstaff come, I prithee do thou stand in some by-room, while I question my puny drawer to what end he gave me the sugar, and do thou never leave calling &#8220;Francis,&#8221; that his tale to me may be nothing but &#8220;Anon.&#8221; Step aside, and I&#8217;ll show thee a president.</line>

That thou art my son I have partly thy mother&#8217;s word, partly my own opinion, but chiefly a villainous trick of thine eye, and a foolish hanging of thy nether lip, that doth warrant me. If then thou be son to me, here lies the point: why being son to me, art thou so pointed at? Shall the blessed sun of heaven prove a micher and eat blackberries? A question not to be ask&#8217;d. Shall the son of England prove a thief and take purses? A question to be ask&#8217;d. There is a thing, Harry, which thou hast often heard of, and it is known to many in our land by the name of pitch. This pitch (as ancient writers do report) doth defile, so doth the company thou keepest; for, Harry, now I do not speak to thee in drink, but in tears; not in pleasure, but in passion; not in words only, but in woes also.

If that man should be lewdly given, he deceiveth me; for, Harry, I see virtue in his looks. If then the tree may be known by the fruit, as the fruit by the tree, then peremptorily I speak it, there is virtue in that Falstaff; him keep with, the rest banish.

I have got, in exchange of a hundred and fifty soldiers, three hundred and odd pounds. I press me none but good householders, yeomen&#8217;s sons, inquire me out contracted bachelors, such as had been ask&#8217;d twice on the banes, such a commodity of warm slaves, as had as lieve hear the devil as a drum, such as fear the report of a caliver worse than a struck fowl or a hurt wild duck. I press&#8217;d me none but such toasts-and-butter, with hearts in their bellies no bigger than pins&#8217; heads, and they have bought out their services; and now my whole charge consists of ancients, corporals, lieutenants, gentlemen of companies&#8212;slaves as ragged as Lazarus in the painted cloth, where the glutton&#8217;s dogs lick&#8217;d his sores, and such as indeed were never soldiers, but discarded unjust servingmen, younger sons to younger brothers, revolted tapsters, and ostlers trade-fall&#8217;n, the cankers of a calm world and a long peace, ten times more dishonorable ragged than an old feaz&#8217;d ancient: and such have I, to fill up the rooms of them as have bought out their services, that you would think that I had a hundred and fifty totter&#8217;d prodigals lately come from swine-keeping, from eating draff and husks. A mad fellow met me on the way and told me I had unloaded all the gibbets and press&#8217;d the dead bodies. No eye hath seen such scarecrows. I&#8217;ll not march through Coventry with them, that&#8217;s flat. Nay, and the villains march wide betwixt the legs, as if they had gyves on, for indeed I had the most of them out of prison. There&#8217;s not a shirt and a half in all my company, and the half shirt is two napkins tack&#8217;d together and thrown over the shoulders like a herald&#8217;s coat without sleeves; and the shirt, to say the truth, stol&#8217;n from my host at Saint Albons, or the red-nose innkeeper of Daventry.
