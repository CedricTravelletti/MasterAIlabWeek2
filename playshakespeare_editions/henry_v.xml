<line number="13" form="verse">Why the law Salique, that they have in France,</line>

<line number="15" form="verse">And God forbid, my dear and faithful lord,</line>

<line number="25" form="verse">We charge you, in the name of God, take heed;</line>
<line number="26" form="verse">For never two such kingdoms did contend</line>
<line number="27" form="verse">Without much fall of blood, whose guiltless drops</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Archbishop of Canterbury">CANT.</speaker>
<line number="35" form="verse">Then hear me, gracious sovereign, and you peers,</line>
<line number="36" form="verse">That owe yourselves, your lives, and services</line>
<line number="37" form="verse">To this imperial throne. There is no bar</line>
<line number="38" form="verse">To make against your Highness&#8217; claim to France</line>
<line number="39" form="verse">But this, which they produce from Pharamond:</line>
<line number="40" form="verse">&#8220;<latin xml:lang="la">In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant,</latin>&#8221;</line>
<line number="41" form="verse">&#8220;No woman shall succeed in Salique land&#8221;;</line>
<line number="42" form="verse">Which Salique land the French unjustly gloze</line>
<line number="43" form="verse">To be the realm of France, and Pharamond</line>
<line number="44" form="verse">The founder of this law and female bar.</line>
<line number="45" form="verse">Yet their own authors faithfully affirm</line>
<line number="46" form="verse">That the land Salique is in Germany,</line>
<line number="47" form="verse">Between the floods of Sala and of Elbe;</line>
<line number="48" form="verse">Where Charles the Great, having subdu&#8217;d the Saxons,</line>
<line number="49" form="verse">There left behind and settled certain French;</line>
<line number="50" form="verse">Who holding in disdain the German women</line>
<line number="51" form="verse">For some dishonest manners of their life,</line>
<line number="52" form="verse">Establish&#8217;d then this law: to wit, no female</line>
<line number="53" form="verse">Should be inheritrix in Salique land;</line>
<line number="54" form="verse">Which Salique, as I said, &#8217;twixt Elbe and Sala,</line>
<line number="55" form="verse">Is at this day in Germany call&#8217;d Meisen.</line>
<line number="56" form="verse">Then doth it well appear the Salique law</line>
<line number="57" form="verse">Was not devised for the realm of France;</line>
<line number="58" form="verse">Nor did the French possess the Salique land</line>
<line number="59" form="verse">Until four hundred one and twenty years</line>
<line number="60" form="verse">After defunction of King Pharamond,</line>
<line number="61" form="verse">Idly suppos&#8217;d the founder of this law,</line>
<line number="62" form="verse">Who died within the year of our redemption</line>
<line number="63" form="verse">Four hundred twenty-six; and Charles the Great</line>
<line number="64" form="verse">Subdu&#8217;d the Saxons, and did seat the French</line>
<line number="65" form="verse">Beyond the river Sala, in the year</line>
<line number="66" form="verse">Eight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,</line>
<line number="67" form="verse">King Pepin, which deposed Childeric,</line>
<line number="68" form="verse">Did, as heir general, being descended</line>
<line number="69" form="verse">Of Blithild, which was daughter to King Clothair,</line>
<line number="70" form="verse">Make claim and title to the crown of France.</line>
<line number="71" form="verse">Hugh Capet also, who usurp&#8217;d the crown</line>
<line number="72" form="verse">Of Charles the Duke of Lorraine, sole heir male</line>
<line number="73" form="verse">Of the true line and stock of Charles the Great,</line>
<line number="74" form="verse">To fine his title with some shows of truth,</line>
<line number="75" form="verse">Though in pure truth it was corrupt and naught,</line>
<line number="76" form="verse">Convey&#8217;d himself as th&#8217; heir to th&#8217; Lady Lingare,</line>
<line number="77" form="verse">Daughter to Charlemain, who was the son</line>
<line number="78" form="verse">To Lewis the Emperor, and Lewis the son</line>
<line number="79" form="verse">Of Charles the Great. Also King Lewis the Tenth,</line>
<line number="80" form="verse">Who was sole heir to the usurper Capet,</line>
<line number="81" form="verse">Could not keep quiet in his conscience,</line>
<line number="82" form="verse">Wearing the crown of France, till satisfied</line>
<line number="83" form="verse">That fair Queen Isabel, his grandmother,</line>
<line number="84" form="verse">Was lineal of the Lady Ermengare,</line>
<line number="85" form="verse">Daughter to Charles, the foresaid Duke of Lorraine;</line>
<line number="86" form="verse">By the which marriage the line of Charles the Great</line>
<line number="87" form="verse">Was re-united to the crown of France.</line>
<line number="88" form="verse">So that, as clear as is the summer&#8217;s sun,</line>
<line number="89" form="verse">King Pepin&#8217;s title and Hugh Capet&#8217;s claim,</line>
<line number="90" form="verse">King Lewis his satisfaction, all appear</line>
<line number="91" form="verse">To hold in right and title of the female;</line>
<line number="92" form="verse">So do the kings of France unto this day.</line>
<line number="93" form="verse">Howbeit, they would hold up this Salique law</line>
<line number="94" form="verse">To bar your Highness claiming from the female,</line>
<line number="95" form="verse">And rather choose to hide them in a net</line>

I am boy to them all three, but all they three, though they would serve me, could not be man to me; for indeed three such antics do not amount to a man. For Bardolph, he is white-liver&#8217;d and red-fac&#8217;d; by the means whereof &#8217;a faces it out, but fights not. For Pistol, he hath a killing tongue and a quiet sword; by the means whereof &#8217;a breaks words, and keeps whole weapons. For Nym, he hath heard that men of few words are the best men, and therefore he scorns to say his prayers, lest &#8217;a should be thought a coward; but his few bad words are match&#8217;d with as few good deeds; for &#8217;a never broke any man&#8217;s head but his own, and that was against a post when he was drunk. They will steal any thing, and call it purchase. Bardolph stole a lute-case, bore it twelve leagues, and sold it for three half-pence. Nym and Bardolph are sworn brothers in filching, and in Callice they stole a fire-shovel. I knew by that piece of service the men would carry coals. They would have me as familiar with men&#8217;s pockets as their gloves or their handkerchers; which makes much against my manhood, if I should take from another&#8217;s pocket to put into mine; for it is plain pocketing up of wrongs. I must leave them, and seek some better service. Their villainy goes against my weak stomach, and therefore I must cast it up.</line>

<line number="51" form="prose">Thus says my King: Say thou to Harry of England, Though we seem&#8217;d dead, we did but sleep; advantage is a better soldier than rashness. Tell him we could have rebuk&#8217;d him at Harflew, but that we thought not good to bruise an injury till it were full ripe. Now we speak upon our cue, and our voice is imperial: England shall repent his folly, see his weakness, and admire our sufferance. Bid him therefore consider of his ransom, which must proportion the losses we have borne, the subjects we have lost, the disgrace we have digested; which in weight to re-answer, his pettiness would bow under. For our losses, his exchequer is too poor; for th&#8217; effusion of our blood, the muster of his kingdom too faint a number; and for our disgrace, his own person kneeling at our feet but a weak and worthless satisfaction. To this add defiance; and tell him, for conclusion, he hath betray&#8217;d his followers, whose condemnation is pronounc&#8217;d. So far my King and master; so much my office.</line>

<speech>
<speaker long="King Henry the Fifth">K. HEN.</speaker>
<line number="81" form="prose">No; nor it is not meet he should. For though I speak it to you, I think the King is but a man, as I am. The violet smells to him as it doth to me; the element shows to him as it doth to me; all his senses have but human conditions. His ceremonies laid by, in his nakedness he appears but a man; and though his affections are higher mounted than ours, yet when they stoop, they stoop with the like wing. Therefore, when he sees reason of fears, as we do, his fears, out of doubt, be of the same relish as ours are; yet in reason, no man should possess him with any appearance of fear, lest he, by showing it, should dishearten his army.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Bates">BATES.</speaker>
<line number="82" form="prose">He may show what outward courage he will; but I believe, as cold a night as &#8217;tis, he could wish himself in Thames up to the neck; and so I would he were, and I by him, at all adventures, so we were quit here.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="King Henry the Fifth">K. HEN.</speaker>
<line number="83" form="prose">By my troth, I will speak my conscience of the King: I think he would not wish himself any where but where he is.</line>

<speaker long="Bates">BATES.</speaker>
<line number="84" form="prose">Then I would he were here alone; so should he be sure to be ransom&#8217;d, and a many poor men&#8217;s lives sav&#8217;d.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="King Henry the Fifth">K. HEN.</speaker>
<line number="85" form="prose">I dare say you love him not so ill to wish him here alone, howsoever you speak this to feel other men&#8217;s minds. Methinks I could not die any where so contented as in the King&#8217;s company, his cause being just and his quarrel honorable.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Williams">WILL.</speaker>
<line number="86" form="prose">That&#8217;s more than we know.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Bates">BATES.</speaker>
<line number="87" form="prose">Ay, or more than we should seek after; for we know enough, if we know we are the King&#8217;s subjects. If his cause be wrong, our obedience to the King wipes the crime of it out of us.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Williams">WILL.</speaker>
<line number="88" form="prose">But if the cause be not good, the King himself hath a heavy reckoning to make, when all those legs, and arms, and heads, chopp&#8217;d off in a battle, shall join together at the latter day and cry all, &#8220;We died at such a place&#8221;&#8212;some swearing, some crying for a surgeon, some upon their wives left poor behind them, some upon the debts they owe, some upon their children rawly left. I am afeard there are few die well that die in a battle; for how can they charitably dispose of any thing, when blood is their argument? Now, if these men do not die well, it will be a black matter for the King that led them to it; who to disobey were against all proportion of subjection.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="King Henry the Fifth">K. HEN.</speaker>
<line number="89" form="prose">So, if a son that is by his father sent about merchandise do sinfully miscarry upon the sea, the imputation of his wickedness, by your rule, should be impos&#8217;d upon his father that sent him; or if a servant, under his master&#8217;s command transporting a sum of money, be assail&#8217;d by robbers and die in many irreconcil&#8217;d iniquities, you may call the business of the master the author of the servant&#8217;s damnation. But this is not so. The King is not bound to answer the particular endings of his soldiers, the father of his son, nor the master of his servant; for they purpose not their death when they purpose their services. Besides, there is no king, be his cause never so spotless, if it come to the arbitrement of swords, can try it out with all unspotted soldiers. Some, peradventure, have on them the guilt of premeditated and contriv&#8217;d murder; some, of beguiling virgins with the broken seals of perjury; some, making the wars their bulwark, that have before gor&#8217;d the gentle bosom of peace with pillage and robbery. Now, if these men have defeated the law and outrun native punishment, though they can outstrip men, they have no wings to fly from God. War is his beadle, war is his vengeance; so that here men are punish&#8217;d for before-breach of the King&#8217;s laws in now the King&#8217;s quarrel. Where they fear&#8217;d the death, they have borne life away; and where they would be safe, they perish. Then if they die unprovided, no more is the King guilty of their damnation than he was before guilty of those impieties for the which they are now visited. Every subject&#8217;s duty is the King&#8217;s, but every subject&#8217;s soul is his own. Therefore should every soldier in the wars do as every sick man in his bed, wash every mote out of his conscience; and dying so, death is to him advantage; or not dying, the time was blessedly lost wherein such preparation was gain&#8217;d; and in him that escapes, it were not sin to think that making God so free an offer, He let him outlive that day to see His greatness and to teach others how they should prepare.</line>

<line number="114" form="prose">The Princess is the better Englishwoman. I&#8217; faith, Kate, my wooing is fit for thy understanding. I am glad thou canst speak no better English, for if thou couldst, thou wouldst find me such a plain king that thou wouldst think I had sold my farm to buy my crown. I know no ways to mince it in love, but directly to say &#8220;I love you&#8221;; then if you urge me farther than to say &#8220;Do you in faith?&#8221; I wear out my suit. Give me your answer, i&#8217; faith, do, and so clap hands and a bargain. How say you, lady?</line>

<speaker long="King Henry the Fifth">K. HEN.</speaker>
<line number="116" form="prose">Marry, if you would put me to verses, or to dance for your sake, Kate, why, you undid me: for the one, I have neither words nor measure; and for the other, I have no strength in measure, yet a reasonable measure in strength. If I could win a lady at leap-frog, or by vauting into my saddle with my armor on my back, under the correction of bragging be it spoken, I should quickly leap into a wife. Or if I might buffet for my love, or bound my horse for her favors, I could lay on like a butcher, and sit like a jack-an-apes, never off. But, before God, Kate, I cannot look greenly, nor gasp out my eloquence, nor I have no cunning in protestation; only downright oaths, which I never use till urg&#8217;d, nor never break for urging. If thou canst love a fellow of this temper, Kate, whose face is not worth sunburning, that never looks in his glass for love of any thing he sees there, let thine eye be thy cook. I speak to thee plain soldier. If thou canst love me for this, take me! If not, to say to thee that I shall die, is true; but for thy love, by the Lord, no; yet I love thee too. And while thou liv&#8217;st, dear Kate, take a fellow of plain and uncoin&#8217;d constancy, for he perforce must do thee right, because he hath not the gift to woo in other places; for these fellows of infinite tongue, that can rhyme themselves into ladies&#8217; favors, they do always reason themselves out again. What? A speaker is but a prater, a rhyme is but a ballad; a good leg will fall, a straight back will stoop, a black beard will turn white, a curl&#8217;d pate will grow bald, a fair face will wither, a full eye will wax hollow; but a good heart, Kate, is the sun and the moon, or rather the sun and not the moon; for it shines bright and never changes, but keeps his course truly. If thou would have such a one, take me! And take me, take a soldier; take a soldier, take a king. And what say&#8217;st thou then to my love? Speak, my fair, and fairly, I pray thee.</line>

But, good Kate, mock me mercifully, the rather, gentle Princess, because I love thee cruelly. If ever thou beest mine, Kate, as I have a saving faith within me tells me thou shalt, I get thee with scambling, and thou must therefore needs prove a good soldier-breeder. Shall not thou and I, between Saint Denis and Saint George, compound a boy, half French, half English, that shall go to Constantinople and take the Turk by the beard? Shall we not?

Now beshrew my father&#8217;s ambition! He was thinking of civil wars when he got me; therefore was I created with a stubborn outside, with an aspect of iron, that when I come to woo ladies, I fright them. But in faith, Kate, the elder I wax, the better I shall appear. My comfort is, that old age, that ill layer-up of beauty, can do no more spoil upon my face. Thou hast me, if thou hast me, at the worst; and thou shalt wear me, if thou wear me, better and better; and therefore tell me, most fair Katherine, will you have me? Put off your maiden blushes, avouch the thoughts of your heart with the looks of an empress, take me by the hand, and say, &#8220;Harry of England, I am thine&#8221;; which word thou shalt no sooner bless mine ear withal, but I will tell thee aloud, &#8220;England is thine, Ireland is thine, France is thine, and Henry Plantagenet is thine&#8221;; who, though I speak it before his face, if he be not fellow with the best king, thou shalt find the best king of good fellows.
