<line number="81" form="prose">Virginity being blown down, man will quicklier be blown up. Marry, in blowing him down again, with the breach yourselves made, you lose your city. It is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to preserve virginity. Loss of virginity is rational increase, and there was never virgin got till virginity was first lost. That you were made of is metal to make virgins. Virginity, by being once lost, may be ten times found; by being ever kept, it is ever lost. &#8217;Tis too cold a companion; away with&#8217;t!</line>

<line number="83" form="prose">There&#8217;s little can be said in&#8217;t, &#8217;tis against the rule of nature. To speak on the part of virginity is to accuse your mothers, which is most infallible disobedience. He that hangs himself is a virgin; virginity murders itself, and should be buried in highways out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate offendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites, much like a cheese, consumes itself to the very paring, and so dies with feeding his own stomach. Besides, virginity is peevish, proud, idle, made of self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the canon. Keep it not, you cannot choose but lose by&#8217;t. Out with&#8217;t! Within t&#8217; one year it will make itself two, which is a goodly increase, and the principal itself not much the worse. Away with&#8217;t!</line>

Off with&#8217;t while &#8217;tis vendible; answer the time of request. Virginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap out of fashion, richly suited, but unsuitable&#8212;just like the brooch and the toothpick, which wear not now. Your date is better in your pie and your porridge than in your cheek; and your virginity, your old virginity, is like one of our French wither&#8217;d pears, it looks ill, it eats drily, marry, &#8217;tis a wither&#8217;d pear; it was formerly better, marry, yet &#8217;tis a wither&#8217;d pear.

<line number="19" form="prose">Sir, his wife some two months since fled from his house. Her pretense is a pilgrimage to Saint Jaques le Grand; which holy undertaking with most austere sanctimony she accomplish&#8217;d; and there residing, the tenderness of her nature became as a prey to her grief; in fine, made a groan of her last breath, and now she sings in heaven.</line>
