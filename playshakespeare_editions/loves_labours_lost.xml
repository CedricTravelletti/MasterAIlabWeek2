<line number="1" form="verse">Let fame, that all hunt after in their lives,</line>
<line number="2" form="verse">Live regist&#8217;red upon our brazen tombs,</line>
<line number="3" form="verse">And then grace us in the disgrace of death;</line>
<line number="4" form="verse">When spite of cormorant devouring Time,</line>
<line number="5" form="verse">Th&#8217; endeavor of this present breath may buy</line>
<line number="6" form="verse">That honor which shall bate his scythe&#8217;s keen edge,</line>
<line number="7" form="verse">And make us heirs of all eternity.</line>
<line number="8" form="verse">Therefore, brave conquerors&#8212;for so you are,</line>
<line number="9" form="verse">That war against your own affections</line>
<line number="10" form="verse">And the huge army of the world&#8217;s desires&#8212;</line>
<line number="11" form="verse">Our late edict shall strongly stand in force:</line>
<line number="12" form="verse">Navarre shall be the wonder of the world;</line>
<line number="13" form="verse">Our court shall be a little academe,</line>
<line number="14" form="verse">Still and contemplative in living art.</line>
<line number="15" form="verse">You three, Berowne, Dumaine, and Longaville,</line>
<line number="16" form="verse">Have sworn for three years&#8217; term to live with me,</line>
<line number="17" form="verse">My fellow scholars, and to keep those statutes</line>
<line number="18" form="verse">That are recorded in this schedule here.</line>
<line number="19" form="verse">Your oaths are pass&#8217;d, and now subscribe your names,</line>
<line number="20" form="verse">That his own hand may strike his honor down</line>
<line number="21" form="verse">That violates the smallest branch herein.</line>
<line number="22" form="verse">If you are arm&#8217;d to do, as sworn to do,</line>
<line number="23" form="verse">Subscribe to your deep oaths, and keep it too.</line>

<speaker long="Longaville">LONG.</speaker>
<line number="24" form="verse">I am resolved, &#8217;tis but a three years&#8217; fast:</line>
<line number="25" form="verse">The mind shall banquet, though the body pine;</line>
<line number="26" form="verse">Fat paunches have lean pates; and dainty bits</line>
<line number="27" form="verse">Make rich the ribs, but bankrout quite the wits.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Dumaine">DUM.</speaker>
<line number="28" form="verse">My loving lord, Dumaine is mortified:</line>
<line number="29" form="verse">The grosser manner of these world&#8217;s delights</line>
<line number="30" form="verse">He throws upon the gross world&#8217;s baser slaves;</line>
<line number="31" form="verse">To love, to wealth, to pomp, I pine and die,</line>
<line number="32" form="verse">With all these living in philosophy.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Berowne">BER.</speaker>
<line number="33" form="verse">I can but say their protestation over:</line>
<line number="34" form="verse">So much, dear liege, I have already sworn,</line>
<line number="35" form="verse">That is, to live and study here three years.</line>
<line number="36" form="verse">But there are other strict observances:</line>
<line number="37" form="verse">As not to see a woman in that term,</line>
<line number="38" form="verse">Which I hope well is not enrolled there;</line>
<line number="39" form="verse">And one day in a week to touch no food,</line>
<line number="40" form="verse">And but one meal on every day beside,</line>
<line number="41" form="verse">The which I hope is not enrolled there;</line>
<line number="42" form="verse">And then to sleep but three hours in the night,</line>
<line number="43" form="verse">And not be seen to wink of all the day&#8212;</line>
<line number="44" form="verse">When I was wont to think no harm all night,</line>
<line number="45" form="verse">And make a dark night too of half the day&#8212;</line>
<line number="46" form="verse">Which I hope well is not enrolled there.</line>
<line number="47" form="verse">O, these are barren tasks, too hard to keep,</line>
<line number="48" form="verse">Not to see ladies, study, fast, not sleep.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Ferdinand, King of Navarre">KING.</speaker>
<line number="49" form="verse">Your oath is pass&#8217;d to pass away from these.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Berowne">BER.</speaker>
<line number="50" form="verse">Let me say no, my liege, and if you please:</line>
<line number="51" form="verse">I only swore to study with your Grace,</line>
<line number="52" form="verse">And stay here in your court for three years&#8217; space.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Longaville">LONG.</speaker>
<line number="53" form="verse">You swore to that, Berowne, and to the rest.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Berowne">BER.</speaker>
<line number="54" form="verse">By yea and nay, sir, then I swore in jest.</line>
<line number="55" form="verse">What is the end of study, let me know.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Ferdinand, King of Navarre">KING.</speaker>
<line number="56" form="verse">Why, that to know which else we should not know.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Berowne">BER.</speaker>
<line number="57" form="verse">Things hid and barr&#8217;d (you mean) from common sense.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Ferdinand, King of Navarre">KING.</speaker>
<line number="58" form="verse">Ay, that is study&#8217;s godlike recompense.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Berowne">BER.</speaker>
<line number="59" form="verse">Com&#8217; on then, I will swear to study so,</line>
<line number="60" form="verse">To know the thing I am forbid to know:</line>
<line number="61" form="verse">As thus&#8212;to study where I well may dine,</line>
<line number="62" form="verse">When I to feast expressly am forbid;</line>
<line number="63" form="verse">Or study where to meet some mistress fine,</line>
<line number="64" form="verse">When mistresses from common sense are hid;</line>
<line number="65" form="verse">Or having sworn too hard-a-keeping oath,</line>
<line number="66" form="verse">Study to break it and not break my troth.</line>
<line number="67" form="verse">If study&#8217;s gain be thus, and this be so,</line>
<line number="68" form="verse">Study knows that which yet it doth not know.</line>
<line number="69" form="verse">Swear me to this, and I will ne&#8217;er say no.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Ferdinand, King of Navarre">KING.</speaker>
<line number="70" form="verse">These be the stops that hinder study quite,</line>
<line number="71" form="verse">And train our intellects to vain delight.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Berowne">BER.</speaker>
<line number="72" form="verse">Why? All delights are vain, but that most vain</line>
<line number="73" form="verse">Which, with pain purchas&#8217;d, doth inherit pain:</line>
<line number="74" form="verse">As, painfully to pore upon a book</line>
<line number="75" form="verse">To seek the light of truth, while truth the while</line>
<line number="76" form="verse">Doth falsely blind the eyesight of his look.</line>
<line number="77" form="verse">Light, seeking light, doth light of light beguile;</line>
<line number="78" form="verse">So ere you find where light in darkness lies,</line>
<line number="79" form="verse">Your light grows dark by losing of your eyes.</line>
<line number="80" form="verse">Study me how to please the eye indeed</line>
<line number="81" form="verse">By fixing it upon a fairer eye,</line>
<line number="82" form="verse">Who dazzling so, that eye shall be his heed,</line>
<line number="83" form="verse">And give him light that it was blinded by.</line>
<line number="84" form="verse">Study is like the heaven&#8217;s glorious sun,</line>
<line number="85" form="verse">That will not be deep search&#8217;d with saucy looks;</line>
<line number="86" form="verse">Small have continual plodders ever won,</line>
<line number="87" form="verse">Save base authority from others&#8217; books.</line>
<line number="88" form="verse">These earthly godfathers of heaven&#8217;s lights,</line>
<line number="89" form="verse">That give a name to every fixed star,</line>
<line number="90" form="verse">Have no more profit of their shining nights</line>
<line number="91" form="verse">Than those that walk and wot not what they are.</line>
<line number="92" form="verse">Too much to know is to know nought but fame;</line>
<line number="93" form="verse">And every godfather can give a name.</line>

Shall I enforce thy love? I could. Shall I entreat thy love? I will. What shalt thou exchange for rags? Robes; for tittles? Titles; for thyself? Me.

<line number="323" form="verse">Above their functions and their offices.</line>
<line number="324" form="verse">It adds a precious seeing to the eye:</line>
