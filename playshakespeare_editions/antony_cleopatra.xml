<line>Why, sir, give the gods a thankful sacrifice. When it pleaseth their deities to take the wife of a man from him, it shows to man the tailors of the earth; comforting therein, that when old robes are worn out, there are members to make new. If there were no more women but Fulvia, then had you indeed a cut, and the case to be lamented.

<speaker long="Mark Antony">ANT.</speaker>
<line>You do mistake your business, my brother never</line>
<line>Did urge me in his act. I did inquire it,</line>

<line>That drew their swords with you. Did he not rather</line>
<line>Discredit my authority with yours,</line>

<line>Your partner in the cause &#8217;gainst which he fought,</line>
<line>Could not with graceful eyes attend those wars</line>
<line>Which fronted mine own peace. As for my wife,</line>
<line>I would you had her spirit in such another;</line>
<line>The third o&#8217; th&#8217; world is yours, which with a snaffle</line>
<line>You may pace easy, but not such a wife.</line>

<line>Shall not make poor my greatness, nor my power</line>
<line>Work without it. Truth is, that Fulvia,</line>
<line>To have me out of Egypt, made wars here;</line>

<line>The barge she sat in, like a burnish&#8217;d throne,</line>

<line>Purple the sails, and so perfumed that</line>
<line>The winds were love-sick with them; the oars were silver,</line>
<line>Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made</line>
<line>The water which they beat to follow faster,</line>
<line>As amorous of their strokes. For her own person,</line>
<line>It beggar&#8217;d all description: she did lie</line>
<line>In her pavilion&#8212;cloth of gold, of tissue&#8212;</line>
<line>O&#8217;er-picturing that Venus where we see</line>

<line>A seeming mermaid steers; the silken tackle</line>
<line>Swell with the touches of those flower-soft hands,</line>
<line>That yarely frame the office. From the barge</line>
<line>A strange invisible perfume hits the sense</line>

<line>I think so too. But you shall find the band that seems to tie their friendship together will be the very strangler of their amity. Octavia is of a holy, cold, and still conversation.</line>
