<line number="49" form="verse">Well, let&#8217;s ascend, i&#8217;God&#8217;s name:</line>
<line number="50" form="verse">In troth, methinks, your stair is somewhat weak;</line>
<line number="51" form="verse">I prithee, honest friend, lend me thy hand</line>

Yet before we...ye see, though it pleaseth the king to raise me thus high, yet I am not proud, for the higher I mount, the better I can see my friends about me. I am now on a far voyage, and this strange wooden horse must bear me thither; yet I perceive by your looks you like my bargain so ill, that there&#8217;s not one of ye all dare enter with me. Truly, here&#8217;s a most sweet gallery;</line>

<line number="59" form="prose">and do it instantly. I confess, his majesty hath been ever good to me; and my offense to his highness makes me of a state pleader a stage player (though I am old, and have a bad voice), to act this last scene of my tragedy. I&#8217;ll send him (for my trespass) a reverend head, somewhat bald; for it is not requisite any head should stand covered to so high majesty. If that content him not, because I think my body will then do me small pleasure, let him but bury it, and take it.</line>

But I can tell thee, my neck is so short, that, if thou shouldst behead an hundred noblemen like myself, thou wouldst ne&#8217;er get credit by it; therefore (look ye, sir), do it handsomely, or, of my word, thou shalt never deal with me hereafter.</line>
