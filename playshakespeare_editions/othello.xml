If the beam of our lives had not one scale of reason to poise another of sensuality, the blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us to most prepost&#8217;rous conclusions.

Put money in thy purse; follow thou the wars; defeat thy favor with an usurp&#8217;d beard. I say put money in thy purse. It cannot be long that Desdemona should continue her love to the Moor&#8212;put money in thy purse&#8212;nor he his to her. It was a violent commencement in her, and thou shalt see an answerable sequestration&#8212;put but money in thy purse. These Moors are changeable in their wills&#8212;fill thy purse with money. The food that to him now is as luscious as locusts, shall be to him shortly as acerb as the coloquintida. She must change for youth; when she is sated with his body, she will find the error of her choice. She must have change, she must; therefore put money in thy purse. If thou wilt needs damn thyself, do it a more delicate way than drowning. Make all the money thou canst. If sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian and a super-subtle Venetian be not too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell, thou shalt enjoy her; therefore make money. A pox of drowning thyself, it is clean out of the way. Seek thou rather to be hang&#8217;d in compassing thy joy than to be drown&#8217;d and go without her.</line>

Now for want of these requir&#8217;d conveniences, her delicate tenderness will find itself abus&#8217;d, begin to heave the gorge, disrelish and abhor the Moor; very nature will instruct her in it and compel her to some second choice. Now, sir, this granted (as it is a most pregnant and unforc&#8217;d position), who stands so eminent in the degree of this fortune as Cassio does? A knave very voluble; no further conscionable than in putting on the mere form of civil and humane seeming, for the better compass of his salt and most hidden loose affection? Why, none, why, none&#8212;a slipper and subtle knave, a finder-out of occasion; that has an eye can stamp and counterfeit advantages, though true advantage never present itself; a devilish knave.
