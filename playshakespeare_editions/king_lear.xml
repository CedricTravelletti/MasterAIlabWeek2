Though the wisdom of nature can reason it thus and thus, yet nature finds itself scourg&#8217;d by the sequent effects. Love cools, friendship falls off, brothers divide: in cities, mutinies; in countries, discord; in palaces, treason; and the bond crack&#8217;d &#8217;twixt son and father. This villain of mine comes under the prediction; 
there&#8217;s son against father: the King falls from bias of nature; there&#8217;s father against child. We have seen the best of our time. Machinations, hollowness, treachery, and all ruinous disorders follow us disquietly to our graves. Find out this villain, Edmund, it shall lose thee nothing, do it carefully. 
And the noble and true-hearted Kent banish&#8217;d! His offense, honesty! &#8217;Tis strange.</line>
