<speech>
<speaker long="Leonato">LEON.</speaker>
<line>I learn in this letter that Don Pedro of Arragon comes this night to Messina.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Messenger">MESS.</speaker>
<line>He is very near by this, he was not three leagues off when I left him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Leonato">LEON.</speaker>
<line>How many gentlemen have you lost in this action?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Messenger">MESS.</speaker>
<line>But few of any sort, and none of name.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Leonato">LEON.</speaker>
<line>A victory is twice itself when the achiever brings home full numbers. I find here that Don Pedro hath bestow&#8217;d much honor on a young Florentine call&#8217;d Claudio.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Messenger">MESS.</speaker>
<line>Much deserv&#8217;d on his part, and equally rememb&#8217;red by Don Pedro. He hath borne himself beyond the promise of his age, doing in the figure of a lamb the feats of a lion. He hath indeed better bett&#8217;red expectation than you must expect of me to tell you how.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Leonato">LEON.</speaker>
<line>He hath an uncle here in Messina will be very much glad of it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Messenger">MESS.</speaker>
<line>I have already deliver&#8217;d him letters, and there appears much joy in him, even so much that joy could not show itself modest enough without a badge of bitterness.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Leonato">LEON.</speaker>
<line>Did he break out into tears?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Messenger">MESS.</speaker>
<line>In great measure.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Leonato">LEON.</speaker>
<line>A kind overflow of kindness. There are no faces truer than those that are so wash&#8217;d. How much better is it to weep at joy than to joy at weeping!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Beatrice">BEAT.</speaker>
<line>I pray you, is <italian xml:lang="it">Signior</italian> Mountanto return&#8217;d from the wars or no?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Messenger">MESS.</speaker>
<line>I know none of that name, lady. There was none such in the army of any sort.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Leonato">LEON.</speaker>
<line>What is he that you ask for, niece?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Hero">HERO.</speaker>
<line>My cousin means <italian xml:lang="it">Signior</italian> Benedick of Padua.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Messenger">MESS.</speaker>
<line>O, he&#8217;s return&#8217;d, and as pleasant as ever he was.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Beatrice">BEAT.</speaker>
<line>He set up his bills here in Messina, and challeng&#8217;d Cupid at the flight, and my uncle&#8217;s fool, reading the challenge, subscrib&#8217;d for Cupid, and challeng&#8217;d him at the burbolt. I pray you, how many hath he kill&#8217;d and eaten in these wars? But how many hath he kill&#8217;d? For indeed I promis&#8217;d to eat all of his killing.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Leonato">LEON.</speaker>
<line>Faith, niece, you tax <italian xml:lang="it">Signior</italian> Benedick too much, but he&#8217;ll be meet with you, I doubt it not.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Messenger">MESS.</speaker>
<line>He hath done good service, lady, in these wars.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Beatrice">BEAT.</speaker>
<line>You had musty victual, and he hath holp to eat it. He is a very valiant trencherman, he hath an excellent stomach.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Messenger">MESS.</speaker>
<line>And a good soldier too, lady.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Beatrice">BEAT.</speaker>
<line>And a good soldier to a lady, but what is he to a lord?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Messenger">MESS.</speaker>
<line>A lord to a lord, a man to a man, stuff&#8217;d with all honorable virtues.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Beatrice">BEAT.</speaker>
<line>It is so indeed, he is no less than a stuff&#8217;d man. But for the stuffing&#8212;well, we are all mortal.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Leonato">LEON.</speaker>
<line>You must not, sir, mistake my niece. There is a kind of merry war betwixt <italian xml:lang="it">Signior</italian> Benedick and her; they never meet but there&#8217;s a skirmish of wit between them.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Beatrice">BEAT.</speaker>
<line>Alas, he gets nothing by that. In our last conflict four of his five wits went halting off, and now is the whole man govern&#8217;d with one; so that if he have wit enough to keep himself warm, let him bear it for a difference between himself and his horse, for it is all the wealth that he hath left to be known a reasonable creature. Who is his companion now? He hath every month a new sworn brother.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Messenger">MESS.</speaker>
<line>Is&#8217;t possible?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Beatrice">BEAT.</speaker>
<line>Very easily possible. He wears his faith but as the fashion of his hat: it ever changes with the next block.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Messenger">MESS.</speaker>
<line>I see, lady, the gentleman is not in your books.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Beatrice">BEAT.</speaker>
<line>No, and he were, I would burn my study. But I pray you, who is his companion? Is there no young squarer now that will make a voyage with him to the devil?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Messenger">MESS.</speaker>
<line>He is most in the company of the right noble Claudio.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Beatrice">BEAT.</speaker>
<line>O Lord, he will hang upon him like a disease; he is sooner caught than the pestilence, and the taker runs presently mad. God help the noble Claudio! If he have caught the Benedick, it will cost him a thousand pound ere &#8217;a be cur&#8217;d.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Messenger">MESS.</speaker>
<line>I will hold friends with you, lady.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Beatrice">BEAT.</speaker>
<line>Do, good friend.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Leonato">LEON.</speaker>
<line>You will never run mad, niece.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Beatrice">BEAT.</speaker>
<line>No, not till a hot January.</line>

<line>Good <italian xml:lang="it">Signior</italian> Leonato, are you come to meet your trouble? The fashion of the world is to avoid cost, and you encounter it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Leonato">LEON.</speaker>
<line>Never came trouble to my house in the likeness of your Grace, for trouble being gone, comfort should remain; but when you depart from me, sorrow abides and happiness takes his leave.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Don Pedro">D. PEDRO.</speaker>
<line>You embrace your charge too willingly. I think this is your daughter.</line>

<speech>
<speaker long="Leonato">LEON.</speaker>
<line>Her mother hath many times told me so.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Benedick">BENE.</speaker>
<line>Were you in doubt, sir, that you ask&#8217;d her?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Leonato">LEON.</speaker>
<line><italian xml:lang="it">Signior</italian> Benedick, no, for then were you a child.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Don Pedro">D. PEDRO.</speaker>
<line>You have it full, Benedick. We may guess by this what you are, being a man. Truly the lady fathers herself. Be happy, lady, for you are like an honorable father.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Benedick">BENE.</speaker>
<line>If <italian xml:lang="it">Signior</italian> Leonato be her father, she would not have his head on her shoulders for all Messina, as like him as she is.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Beatrice">BEAT.</speaker>
<line>I wonder that you will still be talking, <italian xml:lang="it">Signior</italian> Benedick, nobody marks you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Benedick">BENE.</speaker>
<line>What, my dear Lady Disdain! Are you yet living?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Beatrice">BEAT.</speaker>
<line>Is it possible disdain should die while she hath such meet food to feed it as <italian xml:lang="it">Signior</italian> Benedick? Courtesy itself must convert to disdain, if you come in her presence.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Benedick">BENE.</speaker>
<line>Then is courtesy a turncoat. But it is certain I am lov&#8217;d of all ladies, only you excepted; and I would I could find in my heart that I had not a hard heart, for truly I love none.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Beatrice">BEAT.</speaker>
<line>A dear happiness to women, they would else have been troubled with a pernicious suitor. I thank God and my cold blood, I am of your humor for that: I had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man swear he loves me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Benedick">BENE.</speaker>
<line>God keep your ladyship still in that mind! So some gentleman or other shall scape a predestinate scratch&#8217;d face.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Beatrice">BEAT.</speaker>
<line>Scratching could not make it worse, and &#8217;twere such a face as yours were.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Benedick">BENE.</speaker>
<line>Well, you are a rare parrot-teacher.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Beatrice">BEAT.</speaker>
<line>A bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Benedick">BENE.</speaker>
<line>I would my horse had the speed of your tongue, and so good a continuer. But keep your way a&#8217; God&#8217;s name, I have done.</line>

<speech>

<line>Is she not a modest young lady?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Benedick">BENE.</speaker>
<line>Do you question me, as an honest man should do, for my simple true judgment? Or would you have me speak after my custom, as being a profess&#8217;d tyrant to their sex?</line>

<speech>
<speaker long="Claudio">CLAUD.</speaker>
<line>No, I pray thee speak in sober judgment.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Benedick">BENE.</speaker>
<line>Why, i&#8217; faith, methinks she&#8217;s too low for a high praise, too brown for a fair praise, and too little for a great praise; only this commendation I can afford her, that were she other than she is, she were unhandsome, and being no other but as she is, I do not like her.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Claudio">CLAUD.</speaker>
<line>Thou thinkest I am in sport. I pray thee tell me truly how thou lik&#8217;st her.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Benedick">BENE.</speaker>
<line>Would you buy her, that you inquire after her?</line>

<speech>

<line>Can the world buy such a jewel?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Benedick">BENE.</speaker>
<line>Yea, and a case to put it into. But speak you this with a sad brow? Or do you play the flouting Jack, to tell us Cupid is a good hare-finder and Vulcan a rare carpenter? Come, in what key shall a man take you to go in the song?</line>

<speech>
<speaker long="Claudio">CLAUD.</speaker>
<line>In mine eye, she is the sweetest lady that ever I look&#8217;d on.</line>

<speech>
<speaker long="Benedick">BENE.</speaker>
<line>I can see yet without spectacles, and I see no such matter. There&#8217;s her cousin, and she were not possess&#8217;d with a fury, exceeds her as much in beauty as the first of May doth the last of December. But I hope you have no intent to turn husband, have you?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Claudio">CLAUD.</speaker>
<line>I would scarce trust myself, though I had sworn the contrary, if Hero would be my wife.</line>

<line>Is&#8217;t come to this? In faith, hath not the world one man but he will wear his cap with suspicion? Shall I never see a bachelor of threescore again?

<speech>
<speaker long="Benedick">BENE.</speaker>
<line>That I neither feel how she should be lov&#8217;d, nor know how she should be worthy, is the opinion that fire cannot melt out of me; I will die in it at the stake.</line>

<line>That a woman conceiv&#8217;d me, I thank her; that she brought me up, I likewise give her most humble thanks; but that I will have a rechate winded in my forehead, or hang my bugle in an invisible baldrick, all women shall pardon me. Because I will not do them the wrong to mistrust any, I will do myself the right to trust none; and the fine is (for the which I may go the finer), I will live a bachelor.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Don Pedro">D. PEDRO.</speaker>
<line>I shall see thee, ere I die, look pale with love.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Benedick">BENE.</speaker>
<line>With anger, with sickness, or with hunger, my lord, not with love. Prove that ever I lose more blood with love than I will get again with drinking, pick out mine eyes with a ballad-maker&#8217;s pen, and hang me up at the door of a brothel-house for the sign of blind Cupid.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Don Pedro">D. PEDRO.</speaker>
<line>Well, if ever thou dost fall from this faith, thou wilt prove a notable argument.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Benedick">BENE.</speaker>
<line>If I do, hang me in a bottle like a cat, and shoot at me, and he that hits me, let him be clapp&#8217;d on the shoulder, and call&#8217;d Adam.</line>

<line>I wonder that thou (being, as thou say&#8217;st thou art, born under Saturn) goest about to apply a moral medicine to a mortifying mischief.

<line>Yea, but you must not make the full show of this till you may do it without controlment.

In this (though I cannot be said to be a flattering honest man) it must not be denied but I am a plain-dealing villain. I am trusted with a muzzle, and enfranchis&#8217;d with a clog, therefore I have decreed not to sing in my cage. If I had my mouth, I would bite; if I had my liberty, I would do my liking.

<line>Why, he is the Prince&#8217;s jester, a very dull fool; only his gift is in devising impossible slanders.

<line>O, she misus&#8217;d me past the endurance of a block; an oak but with one green leaf on it would have answer&#8217;d her. My very visor began to assume life, and scold with her. She told me, not thinking I had been myself, that I was the Prince&#8217;s jester, that I was duller than a great thaw, huddling jest upon jest with such impossible conveyance upon me that I stood like a man at a mark, with a whole army shooting at me. She speaks poniards, and every word stabs. If her breath were as terrible as her terminations, there were no living near her, she would infect to the north star. I would not marry her, though she were endow&#8217;d with all that Adam had left him before he transgress&#8217;d. She would have made Hercules have turn&#8217;d spit, yea, and have cleft his club to make the fire too. Come, talk not of her; you shall find her the infernal Ate in good apparel. I would to God some scholar would conjure her, for certainly, while she is here, a man may live as quiet in hell as in a sanctuary, and people sin upon purpose, because they would go thither; so indeed all disquiet, horror, and perturbation follows her.</line>

<line>I know that, but I would have thee hence, and here again. I do much wonder that one man, seeing how much another man is a fool when he dedicates his behaviors to love, will, after he hath laugh&#8217;d at such shallow follies in others, become the argument of his own scorn by falling in love&#8212;and such a man is Claudio. I have known when there was no music with him but the drum and the fife, and now had he rather hear the tabor and the pipe; I have known when he would have walk&#8217;d ten mile afoot to see a good armor, and now will he lie ten nights awake carving the fashion of a new doublet; he was wont to speak plain and to the purpose (like an honest man and a soldier), and now is he turn&#8217;d orthography&#8212;his words are a very fantastical banquet, just so many strange dishes. May I be so converted and see with these eyes? I cannot tell; I think not. I will not be sworn but love may transform me to an oyster, but I&#8217;ll take my oath on it, till he have made an oyster of me, he shall never make me such a fool. One woman is fair, yet I am well; another is wise, yet I am well; another virtuous, yet I am well; but till all graces be in one woman, one woman shall not come in my grace. Rich she shall be, that&#8217;s certain; wise, or I&#8217;ll none; virtuous, or I&#8217;ll never cheapen her; fair, or I&#8217;ll never look on her; mild, or come not near me; noble, or not I for an angel; of good discourse, an excellent musician, and her hair shall be of what color it please God. Hah! The Prince and Monsieur Love. I will hide me in the arbor.</line>

<line>Now you talk of a sheet of paper, I remember a pretty jest your daughter told us of.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Leonato">LEON.</speaker>
<line>O, when she had writ it, and was reading it over, she found &#8220;Benedick&#8221; and &#8220;Beatrice&#8221; between the sheet?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Claudio">CLAUD.</speaker>
<line>That.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Leonato">LEON.</speaker>
<line>O, she tore the letter into a thousand half-pence; rail&#8217;d at herself, that she should be so immodest to write to one that she knew would flout her. &#8220;I measure him,&#8221; says she, &#8220;by my own spirit, for I should flout him, if he writ to me, yea, though I love him, I should.&#8221;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Claudio">CLAUD.</speaker>
<line>Then down upon her knees she falls, weeps, sobs, beats her heart, tears her hair, prays, curses: &#8220;O sweet Benedick! God give me patience!&#8221;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Leonato">LEON.</speaker>
<line>She doth indeed, my daughter says so; and the ecstasy hath so much overborne her that my daughter is sometime afeard she will do a desperate outrage to herself. It is very true.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Don Pedro">D. PEDRO.</speaker>
<line>It were good that Benedick knew of it by some other, if she will not discover it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>

<line>To what end? He would make but a sport of it, and torment the poor lady worse.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Don Pedro">D. PEDRO.</speaker>

<speech>
<speaker long="Don Pedro">D. PEDRO.</speaker>
<line>I would she had bestow&#8217;d this dotage on me, I would have daff&#8217;d all other respects, and made her half myself. I pray you tell Benedick of it, and hear what &#8217;a will say.</line>

<speaker long="Leonato">LEON.</speaker>
<line>Were it good, think you?</line>

<line>Hero thinks surely she will die, for she says she will die if he love her not, and she will die ere she make her love known, and she will die if he woo her, rather than she will bate one breath of her accustom&#8217;d crossness.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Don Pedro">D. PEDRO.</speaker>
<line>She doth well. If she should make tender of her love, &#8217;tis very possible he&#8217;ll scorn it, for the man (as you know all) hath a contemptible spirit.</line>

<speaker long="Leonato">LEON.</speaker>
<line>If he do fear God, &#8217;a must necessarily keep peace; if he break the peace, he ought to enter into a quarrel with fear and trembling.</line>

<speaker long="Don Pedro">D. PEDRO.</speaker>
<line>And so will he do, for the man doth fear God, howsoever it seems not in him by some large jests he will make. Well, I am sorry for your niece. Shall we go seek Benedick, and tell him of her love?</line>

<line>This can be no trick: the conference was sadly borne; they have the truth of this from Hero; they seem to pity the lady. It seems her affections have their full bent. Love me? Why, it must be requited. I hear how I am censur&#8217;d; they say I will bear myself proudly, if I perceive the love come from her; they say too that she will rather die than give any sign of affection. I did never think to marry. I must not seem proud; happy are they that hear their detractions, and can put them to mending. 
They say the lady is fair; &#8217;tis a truth, I can bear them witness; and virtuous; &#8217;tis so, I cannot reprove it; and wise, but for loving me; by my troth, it is no addition to her wit, nor no great argument of her folly, for I will be horribly in love with her. I may chance have some odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me, because I have rail&#8217;d so long against marriage; but doth not the appetite alter? A man loves the meat in his youth that he cannot endure in his age. 
Shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of the brain awe a man from the career of his humor? No, the world must be peopled. When I said I would die a bachelor, I did not think I should live till I were married. Here comes Beatrice. By this day, she&#8217;s a fair lady. I do spy some marks of love in her.</line>

<line>Values itself so highly that to her</line>
<line>All matter else seems weak. She cannot love,</line>
<line>Nor take no shape nor project of affection,</line>
<line offset="0">She is so self-endeared.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Ursula">URS.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Sure I think so,</line>
<line>And therefore certainly it were not good</line>
<line>She knew his love, lest she&#8217;ll make sport at it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Hero">HERO.</speaker>
<line>Why, you speak truth. I never yet saw man,</line>
<line>How wise, how noble, young, how rarely featur&#8217;d,</line>
<line>But she would spell him backward. If fair-fac&#8217;d,</line>
<line>She would swear the gentleman should be her sister;</line>
<line>If black, why, Nature, drawing of an antic,</line>
<line>Made a foul blot; if tall, a lance ill-headed;</line>
<line>If low, an agot very vildly cut;</line>
<line>If speaking, why, a vane blown with all winds;</line>
<line>If silent, why, a block moved with none.</line>
<line>So turns she every man the wrong side out,</line>
<line>And never gives to truth and virtue that</line>
<line>Which simpleness and merit purchaseth.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Ursula">URS.</speaker>
<line>Sure, sure, such carping is not commendable.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Hero">HERO.</speaker>
<line>No, not to be so odd, and from all fashions,</line>
<line>As Beatrice is, cannot be commendable.</line>
<line>But who dare tell her so? If I should speak,</line>
<line>She would mock me into air; O, she would laugh me</line>
<line>Out of myself, press me to death with wit.</line>
<line>Therefore let Benedick, like cover&#8217;d fire,</line>
<line>Consume away in sighs, waste inwardly.</line>
<line>It were a better death than die with mocks,</line>
<line>Which is as bad as die with tickling.</line>

<line>Yet tell her of it, hear what she will say.</line>

<line>No, rather I will go to Benedick,</line>

<line>Nay, that would be as great a soil in the new gloss of your marriage as to show a child his new coat and forbid him to wear it. I will only be bold with Benedick for his company, for from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot, he is all mirth. He hath twice or thrice cut Cupid&#8217;s bow-string, and the little hangman dare not shoot at him.

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Don Pedro">D. PEDRO.</speaker>
<line>There is no appearance of fancy in him, unless it be a fancy that he hath to strange disguises&#8212;as to be a Dutchman today, a Frenchman tomorrow, or in the shape of two countries at once, as a German from the waist downward, all slops, and a Spaniard from the hip upward, no doublet. Unless he have a fancy to this foolery, as it appears he hath, he is no fool for fancy, as you would have it appear he is.</line>

<line>If he be not in love with some woman, there is no believing old signs. &#8217;A brushes his hat a&#8217; mornings; what should that bode?</line>

<line>Hath any man seen him at the barber&#8217;s?</line>

<line>No, but the barber&#8217;s man hath been seen with him, and the old ornament of his cheek hath already stuff&#8217;d tennis-balls.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Leonato">LEON.</speaker>
<line>Indeed he looks younger than he did, by the loss of a beard.</line>
</speech>

<line>Nay, &#8217;a rubs himself with civet. Can you smell him out by that?</line>

<line>That&#8217;s as much as to say, the sweet youth&#8217;s in love.</line>

<line>Nay, but his jesting spirit, which is now crept into a lute-string, and now govern&#8217;d by stops.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Don Pedro">D. PEDRO.</speaker>
<line>Indeed that tells a heavy tale for him. Conclude, conclude, he is in love.</line>

<line>Nay, but I know who loves him.</line>

<line>The word is too good to paint out her wickedness. I could say she were worse; think you of a worse title, and I will fit her to it. Wonder not till further warrant.

<line>Well, give them their charge, neighbor Dogberry.</line>
</speech>

<line>First, who think you the most desartless man to be constable?</line>
</speech>

<speech>

<line>Hugh Oatcake, sir, or George Seacole, for they can write and read.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Dogberry">DOG.</speaker>
<line>Come hither, neighbor Seacole. God hath blest you with a good name. To be a well-favor&#8217;d man is the gift of fortune, but to write and read comes by nature.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Second Watchman">2. WATCH.</speaker>
<line>Both which, Master Constable&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Dogberry">DOG.</speaker>
<line>You have: I knew it would be your answer. Well, for your favor, sir, why, give God thanks, and make no boast of it, and for your writing and reading, let that appear when there is no need of such vanity. You are thought here to be the most senseless and fit man for the constable of the watch; therefore bear you the lanthorn. This is your charge: you shall comprehend all vagrom men; you are to bid any man stand, in the Prince&#8217;s name.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Second Watchman">2. WATCH.</speaker>
<line>How if &#8217;a will not stand?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Dogberry">DOG.</speaker>
<line>Why then take no note of him, but let him go, and presently call the rest of the watch together, and thank God you are rid of a knave.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Verges">VERG.</speaker>
<line>If he will not stand when he is bidden, he is none of the Prince&#8217;s subjects.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Dogberry">DOG.</speaker>
<line>True, and they are to meddle with none but the Prince&#8217;s subjects. You shall also make no noise in the streets; for, for the watch to babble and to talk, is most tolerable, and not to be endur&#8217;d.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Second Watchman">2. WATCH.</speaker>
<line>We will rather sleep than talk, we know what belongs to a watch.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Dogberry">DOG.</speaker>
<line>Why, you speak like an ancient and most quiet watchman, for I cannot see how sleeping should offend; only have a care that your bills be not stol&#8217;n. Well, you are to call at all the alehouses, and bid those that are drunk get them to bed.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Second Watchman">2. WATCH.</speaker>
<line>How if they will not?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Dogberry">DOG.</speaker>
<line>Why then let them alone till they are sober. If they make you not then the better answer, you may say they are not the men you took them for.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Second Watchman">2. WATCH.</speaker>
<line>Well, sir.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Dogberry">DOG.</speaker>
<line>If you meet a thief, you may suspect him, by virtue of your office, to be no true man; and for such kind of men, the less you meddle or make with them, why, the more is for your honesty.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Second Watchman">2. WATCH.</speaker>
<line>If we know him to be a thief, shall we not lay hands on him?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Dogberry">DOG.</speaker>
<line>Truly by your office you may, but I think they that touch pitch will be defil&#8217;d. The most peaceable way for you, if you do take a thief, is to let him show himself what he is, and steal out of your company.</line>
</speech>

<line>You have been always call&#8217;d a merciful man, partner.</line>

<line>If you hear a child cry in the night, you must call to the nurse and bid her still it.</line>

<line>How if the nurse be asleep and will not hear us?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Dogberry">DOG.</speaker>
<line>Why then depart in peace, and let the child wake her with crying, for the ewe that will not hear her lamb when it baes will never answer a calf when he bleats.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Verges">VERG.</speaker>
<line>&#8217;Tis very true.</line>
</speech>

<speech>

<line>This is the end of the charge: you, constable, are to present the Prince&#8217;s own person. If you meet the Prince in the night, you may stay him.</line>

<speech>
<speaker long="Verges">VERG.</speaker>
<line>Nay, by&#8217;r lady, that I think &#8217;a cannot.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Dogberry">DOG.</speaker>
<line>Five shillings to one on&#8217;t, with any man that knows the statutes, he may stay him; marry, not without the Prince be willing, for indeed the watch ought to offend no man, and it is an offense to stay a man against his will.</line>

<line>She&#8217;s but the sign and semblance of her honor.</line>
<line>Behold how like a maid she blushes here!</line>
<line>O, what authority and show of truth</line>
<line>Can cunning sin cover itself withal!</line>
<line>Comes not that blood as modest evidence</line>
<line>To witness simple virtue? Would you not swear,</line>
<line>All you that see her, that she were a maid,</line>
<line>By these exterior shows? But she is none:</line>
<line>She knows the heat of a luxurious bed;</line>
<line>Her blush is guiltiness, not modesty.</line>

<line>No, Leonato,</line>
<line>I never tempted her with word too large,</line>

<line>Confirm&#8217;d, confirm&#8217;d! O, that is stronger made</line>

<line>Hear me a little,</line>
<line>For I have only been silent so long,</line>
<line>And given way unto this course of fortune,</line>
<line>By noting of the lady. I have mark&#8217;d</line>
<line>A thousand blushing apparitions</line>
<line>To start into her face, a thousand innocent shames</line>
<line>In angel whiteness beat away those blushes,</line>
<line>And in her eye there hath appear&#8217;d a fire</line>
<line>To burn the errors that these princes hold</line>
<line>Against her maiden truth. Call me a fool,</line>
<line>Trust not my reading, nor my observations,</line>
<line>Which with experimental seal doth warrant</line>
<line>The tenure of my book; trust not my age,</line>
<line>My reverence, calling, nor divinity,</line>

<line>They know that do accuse me, I know none.</line>
<line>If I know more of any man alive</line>

<line>Let all my sins lack mercy! O my father,</line>
<line>Prove you that any man with me convers&#8217;d</line>
<line>At hours unmeet, or that I yesternight</line>
<line>Maintain&#8217;d the change of words with any creature,</line>
<line>Refuse me, hate me, torture me to death!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Friar Francis">FRIAR.</speaker>
<line>There is some strange misprision in the princes.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Benedick">BENE.</speaker>
<line>Two of them have the very bent of honor,</line>
<line>And if their wisdoms be misled in this,</line>
<line>The practice of it lives in John the Bastard,</line>
<line>Whose spirits toil in frame of villainies.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Leonato">LEON.</speaker>
<line>I know not. If they speak but truth of her,</line>
<line>These hands shall tear her; if they wrong her honor,</line>
<line>The proudest of them shall well hear of it.</line>
<line>Time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine,</line>
<line>Nor age so eat up my invention,</line>
<line>Nor fortune made such havoc of my means,</line>
<line>Nor my bad life reft me so much of friends,</line>
<line>But they shall find, awak&#8217;d in such a kind,</line>
<line>Both strength of limb, and policy of mind,</line>
<line>Ability in means, and choice of friends,</line>
<line offset="0">To quit me of them throughly.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Friar Francis">FRIAR.</speaker>
<line offset="6">Pause awhile,</line>
<line>And let my counsel sway you in this case.</line>
<line>Your daughter here the princes left for dead,</line>
<line>Let her awhile be secretly kept in,</line>
<line>And publish it that she is dead indeed.</line>
<line>Maintain a mourning ostentation,</line>
<line>And on your family&#8217;s old monument</line>
<line>Hang mournful epitaphs, and do all rites</line>
<line>That appertain unto a burial.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Leonato">LEON.</speaker>
<line>What shall become of this? What will this do?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Friar Francis">FRIAR.</speaker>
<line>Marry, this well carried shall on her behalf</line>
<line>Change slander to remorse; that is some good.</line>
<line>But not for that dream I on this strange course,</line>
<line>But on this travail look for greater birth:</line>
<line>She dying, as it must be so maintain&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Upon the instant that she was accus&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Shall be lamented, pitied, and excus&#8217;d</line>
<line>Of every hearer; for it so falls out</line>
<line>That what we have we prize not to the worth</line>
<line>Whiles we enjoy it, but being lack&#8217;d and lost,</line>
<line>Why then we rack the value; then we find</line>
<line>The virtue that possession would not show us</line>
<line>Whiles it was ours. So will it fare with Claudio:</line>
<line>When he shall hear she died upon his words,</line>
<line>Th&#8217; idea of her life shall sweetly creep</line>
<line>Into his study of imagination,</line>
<line>And every lovely organ of her life</line>
<line>Shall come apparell&#8217;d in more precious habit,</line>
<line>More moving, delicate, and full of life,</line>
<line>Into the eye and prospect of his soul,</line>
<line>Than when she liv&#8217;d indeed. Then shall he mourn,</line>
<line>If ever love had interest in his liver,</line>
<line>And wish he had not so accused her;</line>
<line>No, though he thought his accusation true.</line>
<line>Let this be so, and doubt not but success</line>
<line>Will fashion the event in better shape</line>
<line>Than I can lay it down in likelihood.</line>
<line>But if all aim but this be levell&#8217;d false,</line>
<line>The supposition of the lady&#8217;s death</line>
<line>Will quench the wonder of her infamy.</line>
<line>And if it sort not well, you may conceal her,</line>
<line>As best befits her wounded reputation,</line>
<line>In some reclusive and religious life,</line>
<line>Out of all eyes, tongues, minds, and injuries.</line>

<line offset="3">I pray thee cease thy counsel,</line>

<line>As water in a sieve. Give not me counsel,</line>
<line>Nor let no comforter delight mine ear</line>
<line>But such a one whose wrongs do suit with mine.</line>
<line>Bring me a father that so lov&#8217;d his child,</line>
<line>Whose joy of her is overwhelm&#8217;d like mine,</line>
<line>And bid him speak of patience;</line>
<line>Measure his woe the length and breadth of mine,</line>
<line>And let it answer every strain for strain,</line>
<line>As thus for thus, and such a grief for such,</line>
<line>In every lineament, branch, shape, and form;</line>
<line>If such a one will smile and stroke his beard,</line>

<line>Patch grief with proverbs, make misfortune drunk</line>
<line>With candle-wasters, bring him yet to me,</line>
<line>And I of him will gather patience.</line>
<line>But there is no such man, for, brother, men</line>
<line>Can counsel and speak comfort to that grief</line>
<line>Which they themselves not feel, but tasting it,</line>
<line>Their counsel turns to passion, which before</line>
<line>Would give preceptial med&#8217;cine to rage,</line>
<line>Fetter strong madness in a silken thread,</line>
<line>Charm ache with air, and agony with words.</line>
<line>No, no, &#8217;tis all men&#8217;s office to speak patience</line>
<line>To those that wring under the load of sorrow,</line>
<line>But no man&#8217;s virtue nor sufficiency</line>

 &#8220;a great gross one.&#8221; &#8220;Nay,&#8221; said I, &#8220;a good wit.&#8221; &#8220;Just,&#8221; said she, &#8220;it hurts nobody.&#8221;
 &#8220;Nay,&#8221; said I, &#8220;the gentleman is wise.&#8221; &#8220;Certain,&#8221; said she, &#8220;a wise gentleman.&#8221; &#8220;Nay,&#8221; 
said I, &#8220;he hath the tongues.&#8221; &#8220;That I believe,&#8221; said she, &#8220;for he swore a thing to me on Monday night, which he forswore on Tuesday morning. 
There&#8217;s a double tongue, there&#8217;s two tongues.&#8221; 
Thus did she an hour together trans-shape thy particular virtues, yet at last she concluded with a sigh, thou wast the proper&#8217;st man in Italy.</line>

<line>How dost thou, Benedick the married man?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Benedick">BENE.</speaker>
<line>I&#8217;ll tell thee what, Prince: a college of wit-crackers cannot flout me out of my humor. Dost thou think I care for a satire or an epigram? No, if a man will be beaten with brains, &#8217;a shall wear nothing handsome about him. In brief, since I do purpose to marry, I will think nothing to any purpose that the world can say against it, and therefore never flout at me for what I have said against it; for man is a giddy thing, and this is my conclusion. 
For thy part, Claudio, I did think to have beaten thee, but in that thou art like to be my kinsman, live unbruis&#8217;d, and love my cousin.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Claudio">CLAUD.</speaker>
<line>I had well hop&#8217;d thou wouldst have denied Beatrice, that I might have cudgell&#8217;d thee out of thy single life, to make thee a double-dealer, which out of question thou wilt be, if my cousin do not look exceeding narrowly to thee.</line>

<line>Come, come, we are friends. Let&#8217;s have a dance ere we are married, that we may lighten our own hearts and our wives&#8217; heels.</line>
