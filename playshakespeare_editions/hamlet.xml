<line>He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.</line>

<speech>
<speaker long="Marcellus">MAR.</speaker>
<line>Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,</line>
<line>Why this same strict and most observant watch</line>
<line>So nightly toils the subject of the land,</line>
<line>And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,</line>
<line>And foreign mart for implements of war,</line>
<line>Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task</line>
<line>Does not divide the Sunday from the week,</line>
<line>What might be toward, that this sweaty haste</line>
<line>Doth make the night joint-laborer with the day:</line>
<line offset="0">Who is&#8217;t that can inform me?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Horatio">HOR.</speaker>
<line offset="6">That can I,</line>
<line>At least the whisper goes so: our last king,</line>
<line>Whose image even but now appear&#8217;d to us,</line>
<line>Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,</line>
<line>Thereto prick&#8217;d on by a most emulate pride,</line>
<line>Dar&#8217;d to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet</line>
<line>(For so this side of our known world esteem&#8217;d him)</line>
<line>Did slay this Fortinbras, who, by a seal&#8217;d compact</line>
<line>Well ratified by law and heraldy,</line>
<line>Did forfeit (with his life) all those his lands</line>
<line>Which he stood seiz&#8217;d of, to the conqueror;</line>
<line>Against the which a moi&#8217;ty competent</line>
<line>Was gaged by our king, which had return&#8217;d</line>
<line>To the inheritance of Fortinbras,</line>
<line>Had he been vanquisher; as by the same comart</line>
<line>And carriage of the article design&#8217;d,</line>
<line>His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,</line>
<line>Of unimproved mettle hot and full,</line>
<line>Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there</line>
<line>Shark&#8217;d up a list of lawless resolutes</line>
<line>For food and diet to some enterprise</line>
<line>That hath a stomach in&#8217;t, which is no other,</line>
<line>As it doth well appear unto our state,</line>
<line>But to recover of us, by strong hand</line>
<line>And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands</line>
<line>So by his father lost; and this, I take it,</line>
<line>Is the main motive of our preparations,</line>
<line>The source of this our watch, and the chief head</line>
<line>Of this post-haste and romage in the land.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Barnardo">BAR.</speaker>
<line>I think it be no other but e&#8217;en so.</line>
<line>Well may it sort that this portentous figure</line>
<line>Comes armed through our watch so like the King</line>
<line>That was and is the question of these wars.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Horatio">HOR.</speaker>
<line>A mote it is to trouble the mind&#8217;s eye.</line>
<line>In the most high and palmy state of Rome,</line>
<line>A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,</line>
<line>The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead</line>
<line>Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets.</line>
<line>As stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood,</line>
<line>Disasters in the sun; and the moist star</line>
<line>Upon whose influence Neptune&#8217;s empire stands</line>
<line>Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.</line>
<line>And even the like precurse of fear&#8217;d events,</line>
<line>As harbingers preceding still the fates</line>
<line>And prologue to the omen coming on,</line>
<line>Have heaven and earth together demonstrated</line>
<line>Unto our climatures and countrymen.</line>

<speech>
<speaker long="Barnardo">BAR.</speaker>
<line>It was about to speak when the cock crew.</line>

<speech>
<speaker long="Horatio">HOR.</speaker>
<line>And then it started like a guilty thing</line>
<line>Upon a fearful summons. I have heard</line>
<line>The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,</line>
<line>Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat</line>
<line>Awake the god of day, and at his warning,</line>
<line>Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,</line>
<line>Th&#8217; extravagant and erring spirit hies</line>
<line>To his confine; and of the truth herein</line>
<line>This present object made probation.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Marcellus">MAR.</speaker>
<line>It faded on the crowing of the cock.</line>
<line>Some say that ever &#8217;gainst that season comes</line>
<line>Wherein our Saviour&#8217;s birth is celebrated,</line>
<line>This bird of dawning singeth all night long,</line>
<line>And then they say no spirit dare stir abroad,</line>
<line>The nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,</line>
<line>No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,</line>
<line>So hallowed, and so gracious, is that time.</line>

<line>So have I heard and do in part believe it.</line>

<line>Break we our watch up, and by my advice</line>
<line>Let us impart what we have seen tonight</line>
<line>Unto young Hamlet, for, upon my life,</line>
<line>This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.</line>

<line>Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother&#8217;s death</line>
<line>The memory be green, and that it us befitted</line>
<line>To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom</line>
<line>To be contracted in one brow of woe,</line>
<line>Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature</line>
<line>That we with wisest sorrow think on him</line>
<line>Together with remembrance of ourselves.</line>
<line>Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,</line>
<line>Th&#8217; imperial jointress to this warlike state,</line>
<line>Have we, as &#8217;twere with a defeated joy,</line>
<line>With an auspicious, and a dropping eye,</line>
<line>With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage,</line>
<line>In equal scale weighing delight and dole,</line>
<line>Taken to wife; nor have we herein barr&#8217;d</line>
<line>Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone</line>
<line>With this affair along. For all, our thanks.</line>
<line>Now follows that you know young Fortinbras,</line>
<line>Holding a weak supposal of our worth,</line>
<line>Or thinking by our late dear brother&#8217;s death</line>
<line>Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,</line>
<line>Co-leagued with this dream of his advantage,</line>
<line>He hath not fail&#8217;d to pester us with message</line>
<line>Importing the surrender of those lands</line>
<line>Lost by his father, with all bands of law,</line>
<line>To our most valiant brother. So much for him.</line>
<line>Now for ourself, and for this time of meeting,</line>
<line>Thus much the business is: we have here writ</line>
<line>To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras&#8212;</line>
<line>Who, impotent and bedred, scarcely hears</line>
<line>Of this his nephew&#8217;s purpose&#8212;to suppress</line>
<line>His further gait herein, in that the levies,</line>
<line>The lists, and full proportions are all made</line>
<line>Out of his subject; and we here dispatch</line>
<line>You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand,</line>
<line>For bearers of this greeting to old Norway,</line>
<line>Giving to you no further personal power</line>

<line>Seems, madam? Nay, it is, I know not &#8220;seems.&#8221;</line>
<line>&#8217;Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,</line>
<line>Nor customary suits of solemn black,</line>
<line>Nor windy suspiration of forc&#8217;d breath,</line>
<line>No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,</line>
<line>Nor the dejected havior of the visage,</line>
<line>Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,</line>
<line>That can denote me truly. These indeed seem,</line>
<line>For they are actions that a man might play,</line>
<line>But I have that within which passes show,</line>
<line>These but the trappings and the suits of woe.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Claudius, King of Denmark">KING.</speaker>
<line>&#8217;Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,</line>
<line>To give these mourning duties to your father.</line>
<line>But you must know your father lost a father,</line>
<line>That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound</line>
<line>In filial obligation for some term</line>
<line>To do obsequious sorrow. But to persever</line>
<line>In obstinate condolement is a course</line>
<line>Of impious stubbornness, &#8217;tis unmanly grief,</line>
<line>It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,</line>
<line>A heart unfortified, or mind impatient,</line>
<line>An understanding simple and unschool&#8217;d:</line>
<line>For what we know must be, and is as common</line>
<line>As any the most vulgar thing to sense,</line>
<line>Why should we in our peevish opposition</line>
<line>Take it to heart? Fie, &#8217;tis a fault to heaven,</line>
<line>A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,</line>
<line>To reason most absurd, whose common theme</line>
<line>Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,</line>
<line>From the first corse till he that died today,</line>
<line>&#8220;This must be so.&#8221; We pray you throw to earth</line>
<line>This unprevailing woe, and think of us</line>
<line>As of a father, for let the world take note</line>
<line>You are the most immediate to our throne,</line>
<line>And with no less nobility of love</line>
<line>Than that which dearest father bears his son</line>
<line>Do I impart toward you. For your intent</line>
<line>In going back to school in Wittenberg,</line>
<line>It is most retrograde to our desire,</line>
<line>And we beseech you bend you to remain</line>
<line>Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye,</line>
<line>Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.</line>

<line>In thews and bulk, but as this temple waxes,</line>
<line>The inward service of the mind and soul</line>
<line>Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,</line>
<line>And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch</line>
<line>The virtue of his will, but you must fear,</line>
<line>His greatness weigh&#8217;d, his will is not his own,</line>
<line>For he himself is subject to his birth:</line>
<line>He may not, as unvalued persons do,</line>
<line>Carve for himself, for on his choice depends</line>
<line>The safety and health of this whole state,</line>
<line>And therefore must his choice be circumscrib&#8217;d</line>
<line>Unto the voice and yielding of that body</line>
<line>Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,</line>
<line>It fits your wisdom so far to believe it</line>
<line>As he in his particular act and place</line>
<line>May give his saying deed, which is no further</line>
<line>Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.</line>
<line>Then weigh what loss your honor may sustain</line>
<line>If with too credent ear you list his songs,</line>
<line>Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open</line>
<line>To his unmast&#8217;red importunity.</line>
<line>Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,</line>
<line>And keep you in the rear of your affection,</line>
<line>Out of the shot and danger of desire.</line>
<line>The chariest maid is prodigal enough</line>
<line>If she unmask her beauty to the moon.</line>
<line>Virtue itself scapes not calumnious strokes.</line>
<line>The canker galls the infants of the spring</line>
<line>Too oft before their buttons be disclos&#8217;d,</line>
<line>And in the morn and liquid dew of youth</line>
<line>Contagious blastments are most imminent.</line>
<line>Be wary then, best safety lies in fear:</line>
<line>Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.</line>

<line>Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar:</line>
<line>Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,</line>
<line>Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel,</line>
<line>But do not dull thy palm with entertainment</line>
<line>Of each new-hatch&#8217;d, unfledg&#8217;d courage. Beware</line>
<line>Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in,</line>
<line>Bear&#8217;t that th&#8217; opposed may beware of thee.</line>
<line>Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice,</line>
<line>Take each man&#8217;s censure, but reserve thy judgment.</line>
<line>Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,</line>
<line>But not express&#8217;d in fancy, rich, not gaudy,</line>
<line>For the apparel oft proclaims the man,</line>
<line>And they in France of the best rank and station</line>
<line>Are of a most select and generous chief in that.</line>
<line>Neither a borrower nor a lender be,</line>
<line>For loan oft loses both itself and friend,</line>
<line>And borrowing dulleth th&#8217; edge of husbandry.</line>
<line>This above all: to thine own self be true,</line>

<line>Believe so much in him, that he is young,</line>

<line>Do not believe his vows, for they are brokers,</line>

<line>Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern!</line>

<line>So much from th&#8217; understanding of himself,</line>
<line>I cannot dream of. I entreat you both</line>
<line>That, being of so young days brought up with him,</line>
<line>And sith so neighbored to his youth and havior,</line>
<line>That you voutsafe your rest here in our court</line>
<line>Some little time, so by your companies</line>
<line>To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather</line>

<line>I will tell you why, so shall my anticipation prevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the King and Queen moult no feather. I have of late&#8212;but wherefore I know not&#8212;lost all my mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed it goes so heavily with my disposition, that this goodly frame, the earth, seems to me a sterile promontory; this most excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave o&#8217;erhanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted with golden fire, why, it appeareth nothing to me but a foul and pestilent congregation of vapors. What a piece of work is a man, how noble in reason, how infinite in faculties, in form and moving, how express and admirable in action, how like an angel in apprehension, how like a god! The beauty of the world; the paragon of animals; and yet to me what is this quintessence of dust? Man delights not me&#8212;nor women neither, though by your smiling you seem to say so.</line>

<line>What speech, my good lord?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Hamlet">HAM.</speaker>
<line>I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never acted, or if it was, not above once; for the play, I remember, pleas&#8217;d not the million, &#8217;twas caviary to the general, but it was&#8212;as I receiv&#8217;d it, and others, whose judgments in such matters cried in the top of mine&#8212;an excellent play, well digested in the scenes, set down with as much modesty as cunning. I remember one said there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savory, nor no matter in the phrase that might indict the author of affection, but call&#8217;d it an honest method, as wholesome as sweet, and by very much more handsome than fine. One speech in&#8217;t I chiefly lov&#8217;d, &#8217;twas Aeneas&#8217; tale to Dido, and thereabout of it especially when he speaks of Priam&#8217;s slaughter. If it live in your memory, begin at this line&#8212;let me see, let me see:</line>
<line>&#8220;The rugged Pyrrhus, like th&#8217; Hyrcanian beast&#8212;&#8221;</line>
<line>&#8217;Tis not so, it begins with Pyrrhus:</line>
<line>&#8220;The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,</line>
<line>Black as his purpose, did the night resemble</line>
<line>When he lay couched in th&#8217; ominous horse,</line>
<line>Hath now this dread and black complexion smear&#8217;d</line>
<line>With heraldry more dismal: head to foot</line>
<line>Now is he total gules, horridly trick&#8217;d</line>
<line>With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,</line>
<line>Bak&#8217;d and impasted with the parching streets,</line>
<line>That lend a tyrannous and a damned light</line>
<line>To their lord&#8217;s murder. Roasted in wrath and fire,</line>
<line>And thus o&#8217;er-sized with coagulate gore,</line>
<line>With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus</line>
<line>Old grandsire Priam seeks.&#8221;</line>
<line>So proceed you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Polonius">POL.</speaker>
<line>&#8217;Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and good discretion.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="First Player (Player King)">1. PLAY.</speaker>
<line>&#8220;Anon he finds him</line>
<line>Striking too short at Greeks. His antique sword,</line>
<line>Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,</line>
<line>Repugnant to command. Unequal match&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Pyrrhus at Priam drives, in rage strikes wide,</line>
<line>But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword</line>
<line>Th&#8217; unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,</line>
<line>Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top</line>
<line>Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash</line>
<line>Takes prisoner Pyrrhus&#8217; ear; for lo his sword,</line>
<line>Which was declining on the milky head</line>
<line>Of reverent Priam, seem&#8217;d i&#8217; th&#8217; air to stick.</line>
<line>So as a painted tyrant Pyrrhus stood</line>
<line>And, like a neutral to his will and matter,</line>
<line>Did nothing.</line>
<line>But as we often see, against some storm,</line>
<line>A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,</line>
<line>The bold winds speechless, and the orb below</line>
<line>As hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder</line>
<line>Doth rend the region; so after Pyrrhus&#8217; pause,</line>
<line>A roused vengeance sets him new a-work,</line>
<line>And never did the Cyclops&#8217; hammers fall</line>
<line>On Mars&#8217;s armor forg&#8217;d for proof eterne</line>
<line>With less remorse than Pyrrhus&#8217; bleeding sword</line>
<line>Now falls on Priam.</line>
<line>Out, out, thou strumpet Fortune! All you gods,</line>
<line>In general synod take away her power!</line>
<line>Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,</line>
<line>And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven</line>

<line>Been strook so to the soul, that presently</line>
<line>They have proclaim&#8217;d their malefactions:</line>
<line>For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak</line>

<line>To be, or not to be, that is the question:</line>
<line>Whether &#8217;tis nobler in the mind to suffer</line>
<line>The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,</line>
<line>Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,</line>
<line>And by opposing, end them. To die, to sleep&#8212;</line>
<line>No more, and by a sleep to say we end</line>
<line>The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks</line>
<line>That flesh is heir to; &#8217;tis a consummation</line>
<line>Devoutly to be wish&#8217;d. To die, to sleep&#8212;</line>
<line>To sleep, perchance to dream&#8212;ay, there&#8217;s the rub,</line>
<line>For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,</line>
<line>When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,</line>
<line>Must give us pause; there&#8217;s the respect</line>
<line>That makes calamity of so long life:</line>
<line>For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,</line>
<line>Th&#8217; oppressor&#8217;s wrong, the proud man&#8217;s contumely,</line>
<line>The pangs of despis&#8217;d love, the law&#8217;s delay,</line>
<line>The insolence of office, and the spurns</line>
<line>That patient merit of th&#8217; unworthy takes,</line>
<line>When he himself might his quietus make</line>
<line>With a bare bodkin; who would fardels bear,</line>
<line>To grunt and sweat under a weary life,</line>
<line>But that the dread of something after death,</line>
<line>The undiscover&#8217;d country, from whose bourn</line>
<line>No traveller returns, puzzles the will,</line>
<line>And makes us rather bear those ills we have,</line>
<line>Than fly to others that we know not of?</line>
<line>Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,</line>
<line>And thus the native hue of resolution</line>
<line>Is sicklied o&#8217;er with the pale cast of thought,</line>
<line>And enterprises of great pitch and moment</line>
<line>With this regard their currents turn awry,</line>
<line>And lose the name of action.&#8212;Soft you now,</line>

<line>Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounc&#8217;d it to you,
trippingly on the tongue, but if you mouth it, as many of our players do, I had as lief the town-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air too much with your hand, thus, but use all gently, for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say, whirlwind of your passion, you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear apassion to totters, to very rags, to spleet the ears of the groundlings, who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb shows and noise.

<line>Be not too tame neither, but let your own discretion be your tutor. Suit the action to the word, the word to the action, with this special observance, that you o&#8217;erstep not the modesty of nature: for any thing so o&#8217;erdone is from the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold as &#8217;twere the mirror up to nature: to show virtue her feature, scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure. Now this overdone, or come tardy off, though it makes the unskillful laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve; the censure of which one must in your allowance o&#8217;erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be players that I have seen play&#8212;and heard others praise, and that highly&#8212;not to speak it profanely, that, neither having th&#8217; accent of Christians nor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so strutted and bellow&#8217;d that I have thought some of Nature&#8217;s journeymen had made men, and not made them well, they imitated humanity so abominably.</line>

<line>I do believe you think what now you speak,</line>
<line>But what we do determine, oft we break.</line>
<line>Purpose is but the slave to memory,</line>
<line>Of violent birth, but poor validity,</line>
<line>Which now, the fruit unripe, sticks on the tree,</line>
<line>But fall unshaken when they mellow be.</line>
<line>Most necessary &#8217;tis that we forget</line>
<line>To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt.</line>
<line>What to ourselves in passion we propose,</line>
<line>The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.</line>
<line>The violence of either grief or joy</line>
<line>Their own enactures with themselves destroy.</line>
<line>Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;</line>
<line>Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.</line>
<line>This world is not for aye, nor &#8217;tis not strange</line>
<line>That even our loves should with our fortunes change:</line>
<line>For &#8217;tis a question left us yet to prove,</line>
<line>Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.</line>
<line>The great man down, you mark his favorite flies,</line>
<line>The poor advanc&#8217;d makes friends of enemies.</line>
<line>And hitherto doth love on fortune tend,</line>
<line>For who not needs shall never lack a friend,</line>
<line>And who in want a hollow friend doth try,</line>
<line>Directly seasons him his enemy.</line>
<line>But orderly to end where I begun,</line>
<line>Our wills and fates do so contrary run</line>
<line>That our devices still are overthrown,</line>

<line>O, my offense is rank, it smells to heaven,</line>
<line>It hath the primal eldest curse upon&#8217;t,</line>
<line>A brother&#8217;s murder. Pray can I not,</line>
<line>Though inclination be as sharp as will.</line>
<line>My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent,</line>
<line>And, like a man to double business bound,</line>
<line>I stand in pause where I shall first begin,</line>
<line>And both neglect. What if this cursed hand</line>
<line>Were thicker than itself with brother&#8217;s blood,</line>
<line>Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens</line>
<line>To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy</line>
<line>But to confront the visage of offense?</line>
<line>And what&#8217;s in prayer but this twofold force,</line>
<line>To be forestalled ere we come to fall,</line>
<line>Or pardon&#8217;d being down? Then I&#8217;ll look up.</line>
<line>My fault is past, but, O, what form of prayer</line>
<line>Can serve my turn? &#8220;Forgive me my foul murder&#8221;?</line>
<line>That cannot be, since I am still possess&#8217;d</line>
<line>Of those effects for which I did the murder:</line>
<line>My crown, mine own ambition, and my queen.</line>
<line>May one be pardon&#8217;d and retain th&#8217; offense?</line>

<line>An eye like Mars, to threaten and command,</line>
<line>A station like the herald Mercury</line>
<line>New lighted on a heaven-kissing hill,</line>
<line>A combination and a form indeed,</line>
<line>Where every god did seem to set his seal</line>
<line>To give the world assurance of a man.</line>
<line>This was your husband. Look you now what follows:</line>
<line>Here is your husband, like a mildewed ear,</line>
<line>Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?</line>
<line>Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,</line>
<line>And batten on this moor? Ha, have you eyes?</line>
<line>You cannot call it love, for at your age</line>
<line>The heyday in the blood is tame, it&#8217;s humble,</line>
<line>And waits upon the judgment, and what judgment</line>
<line>Would step from this to this? Sense sure you have,</line>
<line>Else could you not have motion, but sure that sense</line>
<line>Is apoplex&#8217;d, for madness would not err,</line>
<line>Nor sense to ecstasy was ne&#8217;er so thrall&#8217;d</line>
<line>But it reserv&#8217;d some quantity of choice</line>
<line>To serve in such a difference. What devil was&#8217;t</line>
<line>That thus hath cozen&#8217;d you at hoodman-blind?</line>
<line>Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,</line>
<line>Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,</line>
<line>Or but a sickly part of one true sense</line>
<line>Could not so mope. O shame, where is thy blush?</line>
<line>Rebellious hell,</line>
<line>If thou canst mutine in a matron&#8217;s bones,</line>
<line>To flaming youth let virtue be as wax</line>

<line>How all occasions do inform against me,</line>

<line>If his chief good and market of his time</line>
<line>Be but to sleep and feed? A beast, no more.</line>
<line>Sure He that made us with such large discourse,</line>
<line>Looking before and after, gave us not</line>
<line>That capability and godlike reason</line>
<line>To fust in us unus&#8217;d. Now whether it be</line>
<line>Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple</line>
<line>Of thinking too precisely on th&#8217; event&#8212;</line>
<line>A thought which quarter&#8217;d hath but one part wisdom</line>
<line>And ever three parts coward&#8212;I do not know</line>

<line>Sith I have cause, and will, and strength, and means</line>
<line>To do&#8217;t. Examples gross as earth exhort me:</line>
<line>Witness this army of such mass and charge,</line>
<line>Led by a delicate and tender prince,</line>
<line>Whose spirit with divine ambition puff&#8217;d</line>
<line>Makes mouths at the invisible event,</line>
<line>Exposing what is mortal and unsure</line>
<line>To all that fortune, death, and danger dare,</line>
<line>Even for an egg-shell. Rightly to be great</line>
<line>Is not to stir without great argument,</line>
<line>But greatly to find quarrel in a straw</line>
<line>When honor&#8217;s at the stake. How stand I then,</line>
<line>That have a father kill&#8217;d, a mother stain&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Excitements of my reason and my blood,</line>
<line>And let all sleep, while to my shame I see</line>
<line>The imminent death of twenty thousand men,</line>
<line>That for a fantasy and trick of fame</line>
<line>Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot</line>
<line>Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,</line>

Ere we were two days old at sea, a pirate of very warlike appointment gave us chase. Finding ourselves too slow of ail, we put on a compell&#8217;d valor, and in the grapple I boarded them. On the instant they got clear of our ship, so I alone became their prisoner. They have dealt with me like thieves of mercy, but they knew what they did: I am to do a good turn for them. Let the King have the letters I have sent, and repair thou to me with as much speed as thou wouldest fly death. I have words to speak in thine ear will make thee dumb, yet are they much too light for the bore of the matter. These good fellows will bring thee where I am.

<line>Why, &#8217;tis found so.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="First Clown (Gravedigger)">1. CLO.</speaker>
<line>It must be <latin xml:lang="la">se offendendo</latin>, it cannot be else. For here lies the point: if I drown myself wittingly, it argues an act, and an act hath three branches&#8212;it is to act, to do, to perform; argal, she drown&#8217;d herself wittingly.</line>

<line>Give me leave. Here lies the water; good. Here stands the man; good. If the man go to this water and drown himself, it is, will he, nill he, he goes, mark you that. But if the water come to him and drown him, he drowns not himself; argal, he that is not guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.</line>

<speech>
<speaker long="First Clown (Gravedigger)">1. CLO.</speaker>
<line>Why, there thou say&#8217;st, and the more pity that great folk should have count&#8217;nance in this world to drown or hang themselves, more than their even-Christen. Come, my spade. There is no ancient gentlemen but gard&#8217;ners, ditchers, and grave-makers; they hold up Adam&#8217;s profession.</line>

<line>Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you, though I know to divide him inventorially would dozy th&#8217; arithmetic of memory, and yet but yaw neither in respect of his quick sail; but in the verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of great article, and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as, to make true diction of him, his semblable is his mirror, and who else would trace him, his umbrage, nothing more.</line>
