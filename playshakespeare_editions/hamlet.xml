<speech>
<speaker long="Hamlet">HAM.</speaker>
<line number="295" form="prose">I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never acted, or if it was, not above once; for the play, I remember, pleas&#8217;d not the million, &#8217;twas caviary to the general, but it was&#8212;as I receiv&#8217;d it, and others, whose judgments in such matters cried in the top of mine&#8212;an excellent play, well digested in the scenes, set down with as much modesty as cunning. I remember one said there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savory, nor no matter in the phrase that might indict the author of affection, but call&#8217;d it an honest method, as wholesome as sweet, and by very much more handsome than fine. One speech in&#8217;t I chiefly lov&#8217;d, &#8217;twas Aeneas&#8217; tale to Dido, and thereabout of it especially when he speaks of Priam&#8217;s slaughter. If it live in your memory, begin at this line&#8212;let me see, let me see:</line>
<line number="296" form="verse">&#8220;The rugged Pyrrhus, like th&#8217; Hyrcanian beast&#8212;&#8221;</line>
<line number="297" form="verse">&#8217;Tis not so, it begins with Pyrrhus:</line>
<line number="298" form="verse">&#8220;The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,</line>
<line number="299" form="verse">Black as his purpose, did the night resemble</line>
<line number="300" form="verse">When he lay couched in th&#8217; ominous horse,</line>
<line number="301" form="verse">Hath now this dread and black complexion smear&#8217;d</line>
<line number="302" form="verse">With heraldry more dismal: head to foot</line>
<line number="303" form="verse">Now is he total gules, horridly trick&#8217;d</line>
<line number="304" form="verse">With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,</line>
<line number="305" form="verse">Bak&#8217;d and impasted with the parching streets,</line>
<line number="306" form="verse">That lend a tyrannous and a damned light</line>
<line number="307" form="verse">To their lord&#8217;s murder. Roasted in wrath and fire,</line>
<line number="308" form="verse">And thus o&#8217;er-sized with coagulate gore,</line>
<line number="309" form="verse">With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus</line>
<line number="310" form="verse">Old grandsire Priam seeks.&#8221;</line>

<line number="313" form="verse">&#8220;Anon he finds him</line>
<line number="314" form="verse">Striking too short at Greeks. His antique sword,</line>
<line number="315" form="verse">Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,</line>
<line number="316" form="verse">Repugnant to command. Unequal match&#8217;d,</line>
<line number="317" form="verse">Pyrrhus at Priam drives, in rage strikes wide,</line>
<line number="318" form="verse">But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword</line>
<line number="319" form="verse">Th&#8217; unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,</line>
<line number="320" form="verse">Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top</line>
<line number="321" form="verse">Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash</line>
<line number="322" form="verse">Takes prisoner Pyrrhus&#8217; ear; for lo his sword,</line>
<line number="323" form="verse">Which was declining on the milky head</line>
<line number="324" form="verse">Of reverent Priam, seem&#8217;d i&#8217; th&#8217; air to stick.</line>
<line number="325" form="verse">So as a painted tyrant Pyrrhus stood</line>
<line number="326" form="verse">And, like a neutral to his will and matter,</line>
<line number="327" form="verse">Did nothing.</line>
<line number="328" form="verse">But as we often see, against some storm,</line>
<line number="329" form="verse">A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,</line>
<line number="330" form="verse">The bold winds speechless, and the orb below</line>
<line number="331" form="verse">As hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder</line>
<line number="332" form="verse">Doth rend the region; so after Pyrrhus&#8217; pause,</line>
<line number="333" form="verse">A roused vengeance sets him new a-work,</line>
<line number="334" form="verse">And never did the Cyclops&#8217; hammers fall</line>
<line number="335" form="verse">On Mars&#8217;s armor forg&#8217;d for proof eterne</line>
<line number="336" form="verse">With less remorse than Pyrrhus&#8217; bleeding sword</line>
<line number="337" form="verse">Now falls on Priam.</line>
<line number="338" form="verse">Out, out, thou strumpet Fortune! All you gods,</line>
<line number="339" form="verse">In general synod take away her power!</line>

Nor do not saw the air too much with your hand, thus, but use all gently, for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say, whirlwind of your passion, you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear apassion to totters, to very rags, to spleet the ears of the groundlings, who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb shows and noise.

Now this overdone, or come tardy off, though it makes the unskillful laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve; the censure of which one must in your allowance o&#8217;erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be players that I have seen play&#8212;and heard others praise, and that highly&#8212;not to speak it profanely, that, neither having th&#8217; accent of Christians nor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so strutted and bellow&#8217;d that I have thought some of Nature&#8217;s journeymen had made men, and not made them well, they imitated humanity so abominably.</line>

I have words to speak in thine ear will make thee dumb, yet are they much too light for the bore of the matter. These good fellows will bring thee where I am.

Where be your gibes now, your gambols, your songs, your flashes of merriment, that were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one now to mock your own grinning-quite chop-fall&#8217;n.
