That same knave Ford, her husband, hath the finest mad devil of jealousy in him, Master Brook, that ever govern&#8217;d frenzy. 
I will tell you&#8212;he beat me grievously, in the shape of a woman; for in the shape of man, Master Brook, I fear not Goliah with a weaver&#8217;s beam, because I know also life is a shuttle. I am in haste, go along with me, I&#8217;ll tell you all, Master Brook. Since I pluck&#8217;d geese, play&#8217;d truant, and whipt top, I knew not what &#8217;twas to be beaten till lately. 
Follow me, I&#8217;ll tell you strange things of this knave Ford, on whom tonight I will be reveng&#8217;d, and I will deliver his wife into your hand. 
Follow. Strange things in hand, Master Brook! Follow.</line>
