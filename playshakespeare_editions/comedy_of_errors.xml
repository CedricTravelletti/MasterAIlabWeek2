<line number="3" form="verse">Merchant of Syracuse, plead no more.</line>
<line number="4" form="verse">I am not partial to infringe our laws;</line>
<line number="5" form="verse">The enmity and discord which of late</line>
<line number="6" form="verse">Sprung from the rancorous outrage of your Duke</line>
<line number="7" form="verse">To merchants, our well-dealing countrymen,</line>
<line number="8" form="verse">Who, wanting guilders to redeem their lives,</line>
<line number="9" form="verse">Have seal&#8217;d his rigorous statutes with their bloods,</line>
<line number="10" form="verse">Excludes all pity from our threat&#8217;ning looks:</line>
<line number="11" form="verse">For since the mortal and intestine jars</line>
<line number="12" form="verse">&#8217;Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us,</line>
<line number="13" form="verse">It hath in solemn synods been decreed,</line>
<line number="14" form="verse">Both by the Syracusians and ourselves,</line>
<line number="15" form="verse">To admit no traffic to our adverse towns:</line>
<line number="16" form="verse">Nay more, if any born at Ephesus be seen</line>
<line number="17" form="verse">At any Syracusian marts and fairs;</line>
<line number="18" form="verse">Again, if any Syracusian born</line>
<line number="19" form="verse">Come to the bay of Ephesus, he dies,</line>
<line number="20" form="verse">His goods confiscate to the Duke&#8217;s dispose,</line>
<line number="21" form="verse">Unless a thousand marks be levied</line>
<line number="22" form="verse">To quit the penalty and to ransom him.</line>
<line number="23" form="verse">Thy substance, valued at the highest rate,</line>

<line number="26" form="verse">Yet this my comfort, when your words are done,</line>
<line number="27" form="verse">My woes end likewise with the evening sun.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Solinus, Duke of Ephesus">DUKE.</speaker>
<line number="28" form="verse">Well, Syracusian; say in brief the cause</line>
<line number="29" form="verse">Why thou departedst from thy native home,</line>
<line number="30" form="verse">And for what cause thou cam&#8217;st to Ephesus.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Egeon">EGE.</speaker>
<line number="31" form="verse">A heavier task could not have been impos&#8217;d</line>
<line number="32" form="verse">Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable:</line>
<line number="33" form="verse">Yet that the world may witness that my end</line>
<line number="34" form="verse">Was wrought by nature, not by vile offense,</line>
<line number="35" form="verse">I&#8217;ll utter what my sorrow gives me leave.</line>
<line number="36" form="verse">In Syracuse was I born, and wed</line>
<line number="37" form="verse">Unto a woman, happy but for me,</line>
<line number="38" form="verse">And by me, had not our hap been bad:</line>
<line number="39" form="verse">With her I liv&#8217;d in joy; our wealth increas&#8217;d</line>
<line number="40" form="verse">By prosperous voyages I often made</line>
<line number="41" form="verse">To Epidamium, till my factor&#8217;s death,</line>
<line number="42" form="verse">And the great care of goods at random left,</line>
<line number="43" form="verse">Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse;</line>
<line number="44" form="verse">From whom my absence was not six months old</line>
<line number="45" form="verse">Before herself (almost at fainting under</line>
<line number="46" form="verse">The pleasing punishment that women bear)</line>
<line number="47" form="verse">Had made provision for her following me,</line>
<line number="48" form="verse">And soon, and safe, arrived where I was.</line>
<line number="49" form="verse">There had she not been long but she became</line>
<line number="50" form="verse">A joyful mother of two goodly sons:</line>
<line number="51" form="verse">And, which was strange, the one so like the other</line>
<line number="52" form="verse">As could not be distinguish&#8217;d but by names.</line>
<line number="53" form="verse">That very hour, and in the self-same inn,</line>
<line number="54" form="verse">A mean woman was delivered</line>
<line number="55" form="verse">Of such a burden male, twins both alike.</line>
<line number="56" form="verse">Those, for their parents were exceeding poor,</line>
<line number="57" form="verse">I bought, and brought up to attend my sons.</line>
<line number="58" form="verse">My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,</line>
<line number="59" form="verse">Made daily motions for our home return:</line>
<line number="60" form="verse">Unwilling I agreed. Alas! Too soon</line>
<line number="61" form="verse">We came aboard.</line>
<line number="62" form="verse">A league from Epidamium had we sail&#8217;d</line>
<line number="63" form="verse">Before the always-wind-obeying deep</line>
<line number="64" form="verse">Gave any tragic instance of our harm:</line>
<line number="65" form="verse">But longer did we not retain much hope;</line>
<line number="66" form="verse">For what obscured light the heavens did grant</line>
<line number="67" form="verse">Did but convey unto our fearful minds</line>
<line number="68" form="verse">A doubtful warrant of immediate death,</line>
<line number="69" form="verse">Which though myself would gladly have embrac&#8217;d,</line>
<line number="70" form="verse">Yet the incessant weepings of my wife,</line>
<line number="71" form="verse">Weeping before for what she saw must come,</line>
<line number="72" form="verse">And piteous plainings of the pretty babes,</line>
<line number="73" form="verse">That mourn&#8217;d for fashion, ignorant what to fear,</line>
<line number="74" form="verse">Forc&#8217;d me to seek delays for them and me.</line>
<line number="75" form="verse">And this it was (for other means was none):</line>
<line number="76" form="verse">The sailors sought for safety by our boat,</line>
<line number="77" form="verse">And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us.</line>
<line number="78" form="verse">My wife, more careful for the latter-born,</line>
<line number="79" form="verse">Had fast&#8217;ned him unto a small spare mast,</line>
<line number="80" form="verse">Such as sea-faring men provide for storms;</line>
<line number="81" form="verse">To him one of the other twins was bound,</line>
<line number="82" form="verse">Whilst I had been like heedful of the other.</line>
<line number="83" form="verse">The children thus dispos&#8217;d, my wife and I,</line>
<line number="84" form="verse">Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix&#8217;d,</line>
<line number="85" form="verse">Fast&#8217;ned ourselves at either end the mast,</line>
<line number="86" form="verse">And floating straight, obedient to the stream,</line>
<line number="87" form="verse">Was carried towards Corinth, as we thought.</line>
<line number="88" form="verse">At length the sun, gazing upon the earth,</line>
<line number="89" form="verse">Dispers&#8217;d those vapors that offended us,</line>
<line number="90" form="verse">And by the benefit of his wished light</line>
<line number="91" form="verse">The seas wax&#8217;d calm, and we discovered</line>
<line number="92" form="verse">Two ships from far, making amain to us,</line>
<line number="93" form="verse">Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this.</line>
<line number="94" form="verse">But ere they came&#8212;O, let me say no more!</line>
<line number="95" form="verse">Gather the sequel by that went before.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Solinus, Duke of Ephesus">DUKE.</speaker>
<line number="96" form="verse">Nay, forward, old man, do not break off so,</line>
<line number="97" form="verse">For we may pity, though not pardon thee.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Egeon">EGE.</speaker>
<line number="98" form="verse">O, had the gods done so, I had not now</line>
<line number="99" form="verse">Worthily term&#8217;d them merciless to us!</line>
<line number="100" form="verse">For ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues,</line>
<line number="101" form="verse">We were encount&#8217;red by a mighty rock,</line>
<line number="102" form="verse">Which being violently borne upon,</line>
<line number="103" form="verse">Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst;</line>
<line number="104" form="verse">So that, in this unjust divorce of us,</line>
<line number="105" form="verse">Fortune had left to both of us alike</line>
<line number="106" form="verse">What to delight in, what to sorrow for.</line>
<line number="107" form="verse">Her part, poor soul! Seeming as burdened</line>
<line number="108" form="verse">With lesser weight, but not with lesser woe,</line>
<line number="109" form="verse">Was carried with more speed before the wind,</line>
<line number="110" form="verse">And in our sight they three were taken up</line>
<line number="111" form="verse">By fishermen of Corinth, as we thought.</line>
<line number="112" form="verse">At length, another ship had seiz&#8217;d on us,</line>
<line number="113" form="verse">And knowing whom it was their hap to save,</line>
<line number="114" form="verse">Gave healthful welcome to their shipwrack&#8217;d guests,</line>
<line number="115" form="verse">And would have reft the fishers of their prey,</line>
<line number="116" form="verse">Had not their bark been very slow of sail;</line>
<line number="117" form="verse">And therefore homeward did they bend their course.</line>
<line number="118" form="verse">Thus have you heard me sever&#8217;d from my bliss,</line>
<line number="119" form="verse">That by misfortunes was my life prolong&#8217;d,</line>
<line number="120" form="verse">To tell sad stories of my own mishaps.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Solinus, Duke of Ephesus">DUKE.</speaker>
