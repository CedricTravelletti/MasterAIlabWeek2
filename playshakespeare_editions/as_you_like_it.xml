<line number="1" form="prose">As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion bequeath&#8217;d me by will but poor a thousand crowns, and, as thou say&#8217;st, charg&#8217;d my brother, on his blessing, to breed me well; and there begins my sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and report speaks goldenly of his profit. For my part, he keeps me rustically at home, or (to speak more properly) stays me here at home unkept; for call you that keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses are bred better, for besides that they are fair with their feeding, they are taught their manage, and to that end riders dearly hir&#8217;d; but I (his brother) gain nothing under him but growth, for the which his animals on his dunghills are as much bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave me his countenance seems to take from me. He lets me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a brother, and as much as in him lies, mines my gentility with my education. This is it, Adam, that grieves me, and the spirit of my father, which I think is within me, begins to mutiny against this servitude. I will no longer endure it, though yet I know no wise remedy how to avoid it.</line>

Tomorrow, sir, I wrastle for my credit, and he that escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him well. Your brother is but young and tender, and for your love I would be loath to foil him, as I must for my own honor if he come in; therefore out of my love to you, I came hither to acquaint you withal, that either you might stay him from his intendment, or brook such disgrace well as he shall run into, in that it is a thing of his own search, and altogether against my will.</line>

<speech>
<speaker long="Oliver">OLI.</speaker>
<line number="40" form="prose">Charles, I thank thee for thy love to me, which thou shalt find I will most kindly requite. I had myself notice of my brother&#8217;s purpose herein, and have by underhand means labor&#8217;d to dissuade him from it; but he is resolute. I&#8217;ll tell thee, Charles, it is the stubbornest young fellow of France, full of ambition, an envious emulator of every man&#8217;s good parts, a secret and villainous contriver against me his natural brother; therefore use thy discretion&#8212; I had as lief thou didst break his neck as his finger. And thou wert best look to&#8217;t; for if thou dost him any slight disgrace, or if he do not mightily grace himself on thee, he will practice against thee by poison, entrap thee by some treacherous device, and never leave thee till he hath ta&#8217;en thy life by some indirect means or other; for I assure thee (and almost with tears I speak it) there is not one so young and so villainous this day living. I speak but brotherly of him, but should I anatomize him to thee as he is, I must blush and weep, and thou must look pale and wonder.</line>

Yet he&#8217;s gentle, never school&#8217;d and yet learned, full of noble device, of all sorts enchantingly belov&#8217;d, and indeed so much in the heart of the world, and especially of my own people, who best know him, that I am altogether mispris&#8217;d.

In respect that it is solitary, I like it very well; but in respect that it is private, it is a very vild life. Now in respect it is in the fields, it pleaseth me well; but in respect it is not in the court, it is tedious. As it is a spare life (look you) it fits my humor well; 
but as there is no more plenty in it, it goes much against my stomach. Hast any philosophy in thee, shepherd?</line>

<speaker long="Rosalind">ROS.</speaker>
<line number="197" form="prose">Yes, one, and in this manner. He was to imagine me his love, his mistress; and I set him every day to woo me. At which time would I, being but a moonish youth, grieve, be effeminate, changeable, longing and liking, proud, fantastical, apish, shallow, inconstant, full of tears, full of smiles; for every passion something, and for no passion truly any thing, as boys and women are for the most part cattle of this 
color; would now like him, now loathe him; then entertain him, then forswear him; now weep for him, then spit at him; that I drave my suitor from his mad humor of love to a living humor of madness, which was, to forswear the full stream of the world, and to live in a nook merely monastic. And thus I cur&#8217;d him, and this way will I take upon me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep&#8217;s heart, that there shall not be one spot of love in&#8217;t.</line>

Troilus had his brains dash&#8217;d out with a Grecian club, yet he did what he could to die before, and he is one of the patterns of love. Leander, he would have liv&#8217;d many a fair year though Hero had turn&#8217;d nun, if it had not been for a hot midsummer night; 
for, good youth, he went but forth to wash him in the Hellespont, and being taken with the cramp was drown&#8217;d; 
and the foolish chroniclers of that age found it was&#8212;Hero of Sestos. But these are all lies: men have died from time to time, and worms have eaten them, but not for love.</line>

There was never any thing so sudden but the fight of two rams, and Caesar&#8217;s thrasonical brag of &#8220;I came, saw, and overcame.&#8221; For your brother and my sister no sooner met but they look&#8217;d; no sooner look&#8217;d but they lov&#8217;d; no sooner lov&#8217;d 
but they sigh&#8217;d; no sooner sigh&#8217;d but they ask&#8217;d one another the reason; 
no sooner knew the reason but they sought the remedy: and in these degrees have they made a pair of stairs to marriage, which they will climb incontinent, or else be incontinent before marriage. They are in the very wrath of love, and they will together. Clubs cannot part them.</line>

neither do I labor for a greater esteem than may in some little measure draw a belief from you, to do yourself good, and not to grace me. Believe then, if you please, that I can do strange things. I have, since I was three year old, convers&#8217;d with a magician, most profound in his art, and yet not damnable. If you do love Rosalind so near the heart as your gesture cries it out, when your brother marries Aliena, shall you marry her. I know into what straits of fortune she is driven, and it is not impossible to me, if it appear not inconvenient to you, to set her before your eyes tomorrow, human as she is, and without any danger.</line>

<line number="51" form="prose">O sir, we quarrel in print, by the book&#8212;as you have books for good manners. I will name you the degrees. The first, the Retort Courteous; the second, the Quip Modest; the third, the Reply Churlish; the fourth, the Reproof Valiant; the fift, the Countercheck Quarrelsome; the sixt, the Lie with Circumstance; the seventh, the Lie Direct. All these you may avoid but the Lie Direct; and you may avoid that too, with an If. I knew when seven justices could not take up a quarrel, but when the parties were met themselves, one of them thought but of an If, as, &#8220;If you said so, then I said so&#8221;; 
and they shook hands and swore brothers. Your If is the only peacemaker; much virtue in If.</line>

<line number="1" form="prose">It is not the fashion to see the lady the epilogue; but it is no more unhandsome than to see the lord the prologue. If it be true that good wine needs no bush, &#8217;tis true that a good play needs no epilogue. Yet to good wine they do use good bushes; and good plays prove the better by the help of good epilogues. What a case am I in then, that am neither a good epilogue, nor cannot insinuate with you in the behalf of a good play! I am not furnish&#8217;d like a beggar, therefore to beg will not become me. My way is to conjure you, and I&#8217;ll begin with the women. I charge you, O women, for the love you bear to men, to like as much of this play as please you; and I charge you, O men, for the love you bear to women (as I perceive by your simp&#8217;ring, none of you hates them), that between you and the women the play may please. If I were a woman I would kiss as many of you as had beards that pleas&#8217;d me, complexions that lik&#8217;d me, and breaths that I defied not; and I am sure, as many as have good beards, or good faces, or sweet breaths, will for my kind offer, when I make curtsy, bid me farewell.</line>
