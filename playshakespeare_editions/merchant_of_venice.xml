It is a good divine that follows his own instructions; I can easier teach twenty what were good to be done, than to be one of the twenty to follow mine own teaching. 
The brain may devise laws for the blood, but a hot temper leaps o&#8217;er a cold decree&#8212;such a hare is madness the youth, to skip o&#8217;er the meshes of good counsel the cripple. 
But this reasoning is not in the fashion to choose me a husband. O me, the word choose! I may neither choose who I would, nor refuse who I dislike; 
so is the will of a living daughter curb&#8217;d by the will of a dead father. Is it not hard, Nerissa, that I cannot choose one, nor refuse none?</line>

I fear he will prove the weeping philosopher when he grows old, being so full of unmannerly sadness in his youth.

Certainly the Jew is the very devil incarnation, and in my conscience, my conscience is but a kind of hard conscience, to offer to counsel me to stay with the Jew.
