<speaker long="Rumor, the Presenter">RUM.</speaker>
<line>Open your ears; for which of you will stop</line>
<line>The vent of hearing when loud Rumor speaks?</line>
<line>I, from the orient to the drooping west</line>
<line>(Making the wind my post-horse), still unfold</line>
<line>The acts commenced on this ball of earth.</line>
<line>Upon my tongues continual slanders ride,</line>
<line>The which in every language I pronounce,</line>
<line>Stuffing the ears of men with false reports.</line>
<line>I speak of peace, while covert enmity</line>
<line>Under the smile of safety wounds the world;</line>
<line>And who but Rumor, who but only I,</line>
<line>Make fearful musters and prepar&#8217;d defense,</line>
<line>Whiles the big year, swoll&#8217;n with some other grief,</line>
<line>Is thought with child by the stern tyrant war,</line>
<line>And no such matter? Rumor is a pipe</line>
<line>Blown by surmises, jealousies, conjectures,</line>
<line>And of so easy and so plain a stop</line>
<line>That the blunt monster with uncounted heads,</line>
<line>The still-discordant wav&#8217;ring multitude,</line>
<line>Can play upon it. But what need I thus</line>
<line>My well-known body to anatomize</line>
<line>Among my household? Why is Rumor here?</line>
<line>I run before King Harry&#8217;s victory,</line>
<line>Who in a bloody field by Shrewsbury</line>
<line>Hath beaten down young Hotspur and his troops,</line>
<line>Quenching the flame of bold rebellion</line>
<line>Even with the rebels&#8217; blood. But what mean I</line>
<line>To speak so true at first? My office is</line>
<line>To noise abroad that Harry Monmouth fell</line>
<line>Under the wrath of noble Hotspur&#8217;s sword,</line>
<line>And that the King before the Douglas&#8217; rage</line>
<line>Stoop&#8217;d his anointed head as low as death.</line>
<line>This have I rumor&#8217;d through the peasant towns</line>
<line>Between that royal field of Shrewsbury</line>
<line>And this worm-eaten hold of ragged stone,</line>
<line>Where Hotspur&#8217;s father, old Northumberland,</line>
<line>Lies crafty-sick. The posts come tiring on,</line>
<line>And not a man of them brings other news</line>
<line>Than they have learnt of me. From Rumor&#8217;s tongues</line>
<line>They bring smooth comforts false, worse than true wrongs.</line>

<line>My lord, Sir John Umfrevile turn&#8217;d me back</line>
<line>With joyful tidings, and being better hors&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Outrode me. After him came spurring hard</line>
<line>A gentleman, almost forespent with speed,</line>
<line>That stopp&#8217;d by me to breathe his bloodied horse.</line>
<line>He ask&#8217;d the way to Chester, and of him</line>
<line>I did demand what news from Shrewsbury.</line>
<line>He told me that rebellion had bad luck,</line>
<line>And that young Harry Percy&#8217;s spur was cold.</line>
<line>With that he gave his able horse the head,</line>
<line>And bending forward strook his armed heels</line>
<line>Against the panting sides of his poor jade</line>
<line>Up to the rowel-head, and starting so</line>
<line>He seem&#8217;d in running to devour the way,</line>

<line offset="4">How doth my son and brother?</line>

<line>Is apter than thy tongue to tell thy arrand.</line>
<line>Even such a man, so faint, so spiritless,</line>
<line>So dull, so dead in look, so woe-begone,</line>
<line>Drew Priam&#8217;s curtain in the dead of night,</line>
<line>And would have told him half his Troy was burnt;</line>
<line>But Priam found the fire ere he his tongue,</line>
<line>And I my Percy&#8217;s death ere thou report&#8217;st it.</line>
<line>This thou wouldst say, &#8220;Your son did thus and thus;</line>
<line>Your brother thus; so fought the noble Douglas&#8221;&#8212;</line>
<line>Stopping my greedy ear with their bold deeds,</line>
<line>But in the end, to stop my ear indeed,</line>
<line>Thou hast a sigh to blow away this praise,</line>

<line offset="5">Why, he is dead.</line>
<line>See what a ready tongue suspicion hath!</line>
<line>He that but fears the thing he would not know</line>
<line>Hath by instinct knowledge from others&#8217; eyes</line>
<line>That what he fear&#8217;d is chanced. Yet speak, Morton,</line>
<line>Tell thou an earl his divination lies,</line>
<line>And I will take it as a sweet disgrace</line>
<line>And make thee rich for doing me such wrong.</line>
</speech>

<speech>

<line>You are too great to be by me gainsaid,</line>

<speech>
<speaker long="Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland">NORTH.</speaker>
<line>Yet for all this, say not that Percy&#8217;s dead.</line>
<line>I see a strange confession in thine eye.</line>
<line>Thou shak&#8217;st thy head, and hold&#8217;st it fear or sin</line>
<line>To speak a truth. If he be slain, say so;</line>
<line>The tongue offends not that reports his death,</line>
<line>And he doth sin that doth belie the dead,</line>
<line>Not he which says the dead is not alive.</line>
<line>Yet the first bringer of unwelcome news</line>
<line>Hath but a losing office, and his tongue</line>
<line>Sounds ever after as a sullen bell,</line>
<line>Rememb&#8217;red tolling a departing friend.</line>

<line>I am sorry I should force you to believe</line>
<line>That which I would to God I had not seen,</line>
<line>But these mine eyes saw him in bloody state,</line>
<line>Rend&#8217;ring faint quittance, wearied and outbreath&#8217;d,</line>
<line>To Harry Monmouth, whose swift wrath beat down</line>
<line>The never-daunted Percy to the earth,</line>
<line>From whence with life he never more sprung up.</line>
<line>In few, his death, whose spirit lent a fire</line>
<line>Even to the dullest peasant in his camp,</line>
<line>Being bruited once, took fire and heat away</line>
<line>From the best-temper&#8217;d courage in his troops,</line>
<line>For from his metal was his party steeled,</line>
<line>Which once in him abated, all the rest</line>
<line>Turn&#8217;d on themselves, like dull and heavy lead.</line>
<line>And as the thing that&#8217;s heavy in itself</line>

<line>So did our men, heavy in Hotspur&#8217;s loss,</line>
<line>Lend to this weight such lightness with their fear</line>
<line>That arrows fled not swifter toward their aim</line>
<line>Than did our soldiers, aiming at their safety,</line>
<line>Fly from the field. Then was that noble Worcester</line>
<line>So soon ta&#8217;en prisoner, and that furious Scot,</line>
<line>The bloody Douglas, whose well-laboring sword</line>
<line>Had three times slain th&#8217; appearance of the King,</line>
<line>Gan vail his stomach and did grace the shame</line>
<line>Of those that turn&#8217;d their backs, and in his flight,</line>
<line>Stumbling in fear, was took. The sum of all</line>
<line>Is that the King hath won, and hath sent out</line>
<line>A speedy power to encounter you, my lord,</line>

<line>Men of all sorts take a pride to gird at me. The brain of this foolish-compounded clay, man, is not able to invent any thing that intends to laughter more than I invent or is invented on me: I am not only witty in myself, but the cause that wit is in other men. I do here walk before thee like a sow that hath overwhelm&#8217;d all her litter but one. If the Prince put thee into my service for any other reason than to set me off, why then I have no judgment. Thou whoreson mandrake, thou art fitter to be worn in my cap than to wait at my heels. I was never mann&#8217;d with an agot till now, but I will inset you neither in gold nor silver, but in vile apparel, and send you back again to your master for a jewel&#8212;the juvenal, the Prince your master, whose chin is not yet fledge. I will sooner have a beard grow in the palm of my hand than he shall get one of his cheek, and yet he will not stick to say his face is a face royal. God may finish it when he will, &#8217;tis not a hair amiss yet. He may keep it still at a face royal, for a barber shall never earn sixpence out of it; and yet he&#8217;ll be crowing as if he had writ man ever since his father was a bachelor. He may keep his own grace, but he&#8217;s almost out of mine, I can assure him. What said Master Dommelton about the satin for my short cloak and my slops?</line>

The whoreson smoothy-pates do now wear nothing but high shoes, and bunches of keys at their girdles, and if a man is through with them in honest taking up, then they must stand upon security. I had as live they would put ratsbane in my mouth as offer to stop it with security. I look&#8217;d &#8217;a should have sent me two and twenty yards of satin (as I am a true knight), and he sends me security! Well, he may sleep in security, for he hath the horn of abundance, and the lightness of his wife shines through it; and yet cannot he see, though he have his own lanthorn to light him.

<line>This apoplexy, as I take it, is a kind of lethargy, and&#8217;t please your lordship, a kind of sleeping in the blood, a whoreson tingling.</line>

<line>Not so, my lord. Your ill angel is light, but I hope he that looks upon me will take me without weighing, and yet in some respects I grant I cannot go. I cannot tell. Virtue is of so little regard in these costermongers&#8217; times that true valor is turn&#8217;d berrord; pregnancy is made a tapster, and his quick wit wasted in giving reckonings; all the other gifts appertinent to man, as the malice of this age shapes them, are not worth a gooseberry. You that are old consider not the capacities of us that are young, you do measure the heat of our livers with the bitterness of your galls; and we that are in the vaward of our youth, I must confess, are wags too.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Lord Chief Justice">CH. JUST.</speaker>
<line>Do you set down your name in the scroll of youth, that are written down old with all the characters of age?

Is not your voice broken, your wind short, your chin double, your wit single, and every part about you blasted with antiquity? And will you yet call yourself young? Fie, fie, fie, Sir John!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Sir John Falstaff">FAL.</speaker>
<line>My lord, I was born about three of the clock in the afternoon, with a white head and something a round belly. For my voice, I have lost it with hallowing and singing of anthems. To approve my youth further, I will not. The truth is, I am only old in judgment and understanding; and he that will caper with me for a thousand marks, let him lend me the money, and have at him! For the box of the year that the Prince gave you, he gave it like a rude prince, and you took it like a sensible lord. I have check&#8217;d him for it, and the young lion repents,</line>

There is not a dangerous action can peep out his head but I am thrust upon it. Well, I cannot last ever, but it was alway yet the trick of our English nation, if they have a good thing, to make it too common. If ye will needs say I am an old man, you should give me rest.

<speaker long="Richard Scroop, Archbishop of York">ARCH.</speaker>
<line>Thus have you heard our cause and known our means,</line>
<line>And, my most noble friends, I pray you all</line>
<line>Speak plainly your opinions of our hopes.</line>
<line>And first, Lord Marshal, what say you to it?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Lord Mowbray">MOWB.</speaker>
<line>I well allow the occasion of our arms,</line>
<line>But gladly would be better satisfied</line>
<line>How in our means we should advance ourselves</line>
<line>To look with forehead bold and big enough</line>
<line>Upon the power and puissance of the King.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Lord Hastings">HAST.</speaker>
<line>Our present musters grow upon the file</line>
<line>To five and twenty thousand men of choice,</line>
<line>And our supplies live largely in the hope</line>
<line>Of great Northumberland, whose bosom burns</line>
<line>With an incensed fire of injuries.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Lord Bardolph">L. BARD.</speaker>
<line>The question then, Lord Hastings, standeth thus:</line>
<line>Whether our present five and twenty thousand</line>
<line>May hold up head without Northumberland?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Lord Hastings">HAST.</speaker>
<line offset="0">With him, we may.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Lord Bardolph">L. BARD.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Yea, marry, there&#8217;s the point!</line>
<line>But if without him we be thought too feeble,</line>
<line>My judgment is we should not step too far</line>
<line>Till we had his assistance by the hand.</line>
<line>For in a theme so bloody-fac&#8217;d as this,</line>
<line>Conjecture, expectation, and surmise</line>
<line>Of aids incertain should not be admitted.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Richard Scroop, Archbishop of York">ARCH.</speaker>
<line>&#8217;Tis very true, Lord Bardolph, for indeed</line>
<line>It was young Hotspur&#8217;s cause at Shrewsbury.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Lord Bardolph">L. BARD.</speaker>
<line>It was, my lord, who lin&#8217;d himself with hope,</line>
<line>Eating the air, and promise of supply,</line>
<line>Flatt&#8217;ring himself in project of a power</line>
<line>Much smaller than the smallest of his thoughts,</line>
<line>And so with great imagination,</line>
<line>Proper to madmen, led his powers to death,</line>
<line>And winking, leapt into destruction.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Lord Hastings">HAST.</speaker>
<line>But by your leave, it never yet did hurt</line>
<line>To lay down likelihoods and forms of hope.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Lord Bardolph">L. BARD.</speaker>
<line>Yes, if this present quality of war&#8212;</line>
<line>Indeed the instant action, a cause on foot&#8212;</line>
<line>Lives so in hope, as in an early spring</line>
<line>We see th&#8217; appearing buds, which to prove fruit</line>
<line>Hope gives not so much warrant, as despair</line>
<line>That frosts will bite them. When we mean to build,</line>
<line>We first survey the plot, then draw the model,</line>
<line>And when we see the figure of the house,</line>
<line>Then must we rate the cost of the erection,</line>
<line>Which if we find outweighs ability,</line>
<line>What do we then but draw anew the model</line>
<line>In fewer offices, or at least desist</line>
<line>To build at all? Much more, in this great work</line>
<line>(Which is, almost, to pluck a kingdom down</line>
<line>And set another up), should we survey</line>
<line>The plot of situation and the model,</line>
<line>Consent upon a sure foundation,</line>
<line>Question surveyors, know our own estate,</line>
<line>How able such a work to undergo,</line>
<line>To weigh against his opposite; or else</line>
<line>We fortify in paper and in figures,</line>
<line>Using the names of men in stead of men,</line>
<line>Like one that draws the model of an house</line>
<line>Beyond his power to build it, who, half thorough,</line>
<line>Gives o&#8217;er, and leaves his part-created cost</line>
<line>A naked subject to the weeping clouds</line>
<line>And waste for churlish winter&#8217;s tyranny.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Lord Hastings">HAST.</speaker>
<line>Grant that our hopes (yet likely of fair birth)</line>
<line>Should be still-born, and that we now possess&#8217;d</line>
<line>The utmost man of expectation,</line>
<line>I think we are so a body strong enough,</line>
<line>Even as we are, to equal with the King.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Lord Bardolph">L. BARD.</speaker>
<line>What, is the King but five and twenty thousand?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Lord Hastings">HAST.</speaker>
<line>To us no more, nay, not so much, Lord Bardolph,</line>
<line>For his divisions, as the times do brawl,</line>
<line>Are in three heads: one power against the French,</line>
<line>And one against Glendower; perforce a third</line>
<line>Must take up us. So is the unfirm King</line>

<line>In three divided, and his coffers sound</line>
<line>With hollow poverty and emptiness.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Richard Scroop, Archbishop of York">ARCH.</speaker>
<line>That he should draw his several strengths together,</line>
<line>And come against us in full puissance,</line>
<line offset="0">Need not to be dreaded.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Lord Hastings">HAST.</speaker>
<line offset="5">If he should do so,</line>
<line>To French and Welsh he leaves his back unarm&#8217;d,</line>
<line>They baying him at the heels. Never fear that.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Lord Bardolph">L. BARD.</speaker>
<line>Who is it like should lead his forces hither?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Lord Hastings">HAST.</speaker>
<line>The Duke of Lancaster and Westmorland;</line>
<line>Against the Welsh, himself and Harry Monmouth;</line>
<line>But who is substituted against the French,</line>
<line offset="0">I have no certain notice.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Richard Scroop, Archbishop of York">ARCH.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Let us on!</line>
<line>And publish the occasion of our arms.</line>
<line>The commonwealth is sick of their own choice,</line>
<line>Their over-greedy love hath surfeited.</line>
<line>An habitation giddy and unsure</line>
<line>Hath he that buildeth on the vulgar heart.</line>
<line>O thou fond many, with what loud applause</line>
<line>Didst thou beat heaven with blessing Bullingbrook</line>
<line>Before he was what thou wouldst have him be!</line>
<line>And being now trimm&#8217;d in thine own desires,</line>
<line>Thou, beastly feeder, art so full of him,</line>
<line>That thou provok&#8217;st thyself to cast him up.</line>
<line>So, so, thou common dog, didst thou disgorge</line>
<line>Thy glutton bosom of the royal Richard,</line>
<line>And now thou wouldst eat thy dead vomit up,</line>
<line>And howl&#8217;st to find it. What trust is in these times?</line>
<line>They that, when Richard liv&#8217;d, would have him die,</line>
<line>Are now become enamor&#8217;d on his grave.</line>
<line>Thou, that threw&#8217;st dust upon his goodly head</line>
<line>When through proud London he came sighing on</line>
<line>After th&#8217; admired heels of Bullingbrook,</line>
<line>Cri&#8217;st now, &#8220;O earth, yield us that king again,</line>
<line>And take thou this!&#8221; O thoughts of men accurs&#8217;d!</line>
<line>Past and to come seems best; things present worst.</line>

I pray you, since my exion is ent&#8217;red and my case so openly known to the world, let him be brought in to his answer. A hundred mark is a long one for a poor lone woman to bear, and I have borne, and borne, and borne, and have been fubb&#8217;d off, and fubb&#8217;d off, and fubb&#8217;d off, from this day to that day, that it is a shame to be thought on.

<speaker long="Lord Chief Justice">CH. JUST.</speaker>
<line>For what sum?</line>

<speech>
<speaker long="Hostess Quickly">HOST.</speaker>
<line>It is more than for some, my lord, it is for all I have. He hath eaten me out of house and home, he hath put all my substance into that fat belly of his, but I will have some of it out again, or I will ride thee a&#8217; nights like the mare.</line>

<line>How comes this, Sir John? What man of good temper would endure this tempest of exclamation? Are you not asham&#8217;d to enforce a poor widow to so rough a course to come by her own?</line>

<speech>
<speaker long="Sir John Falstaff">FAL.</speaker>
<line>What is the gross sum that I owe thee?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Hostess Quickly">HOST.</speaker>
<line>Marry, if thou wert an honest man, thyself and the money too. Thou didst swear to me upon a parcel-gilt goblet, sitting in my Dauphin chamber, at the round table by a sea-coal fire, upon Wednesday in Wheeson week, when the Prince broke thy head for liking his father to a singing-man of Windsor, thou didst swear to me then, as I was washing thy wound, to marry me and make me my lady thy wife. Canst thou deny it? Did not goodwife Keech, the butcher&#8217;s wife, come in then and call me gossip Quickly? Coming in to borrow a mess of vinegar, telling us she had a good dish of prawns, whereby thou didst desire to eat some, whereby I told thee they were ill for a green wound? And didst thou not, when she was gone down stairs, desire me to be no more so familiarity with such poor people, saying that ere long they should call me madam? And didst thou not kiss me, and bid me fetch thee thirty shillings? I put thee now to thy book-oath. Deny it if thou canst.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Sir John Falstaff">FAL.</speaker>
<line>My lord, this is a poor mad soul, and she says up and down the town that her eldest son is like you. She hath been in good case, and the truth is, poverty hath distracted her. But for these foolish officers, I beseech you I may have redress against them.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Lord Chief Justice">CH. JUST.</speaker>
<line>Sir John, Sir John, I am well acquainted with your manner of wrenching the true cause the false way. It is not a confident brow, nor the throng of words that come with such more than impudent sauciness from you, can thrust me from a level consideration. You have, as it appears to me, practic&#8217;d upon the easy-yielding spirit of this woman, and made her serve your uses both in purse and in person.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Hostess Quickly">HOST.</speaker>
<line>Yea, in truth, my lord.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Lord Chief Justice">CH. JUST.</speaker>
<line>Pray thee peace. Pay her the debt you owe her, and unpay the villainy you have done with her. The one you may do with sterling money, and the other with current repentance.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Sir John Falstaff">FAL.</speaker>
<line>My lord, I will not undergo this sneap without reply. You call honorable boldness impudent sauciness; if a man will make curtsy and say nothing, he is virtuous. No, my lord, my humble duty rememb&#8217;red, I will not be your suitor. I say to you, I do desire deliverance from these officers, being upon hasty employment in the King&#8217;s affairs.</line>

<line>Before God, I am exceeding weary.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Poins">POINS.</speaker>
<line>Is&#8217;t come to that? I had thought weariness durst not have attach&#8217;d one of so high blood.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Prince Henry">PRINCE.</speaker>
<line>Faith, it does me, though it discolors the complexion of my greatness to acknowledge it. Doth it not show vildly in me to desire small beer?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Poins">POINS.</speaker>
<line>Why, a prince should not be so loosely studied as to remember so weak a composition.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Prince Henry">PRINCE.</speaker>
<line>Belike then my appetite was not princely got, for, by my troth, I do now remember the poor creature, small beer. But indeed these humble considerations make me out of love with my greatness. What a disgrace is it to me to remember thy name, or to know thy face tomorrow, or to take note how many pair of silk stockings thou hast, viz., these, and those that were thy peach-color&#8217;d once, or to bear the inventory of thy shirts, as one for superfluity, and another for use! But that the tennis-court-keeper knows better than I, for it is a low ebb of linen with thee when thou keepest not racket there; as thou hast not done a great while, because the rest of the low countries have made a shift to eat up thy holland. And God knows whether those that bawl out the ruins of thy linen shall inherit his kingdom: but the midwives say the children are not in the fault, whereupon the world increases, and kinreds are mightily strengthen&#8217;d.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Poins">POINS.</speaker>
<line>How ill it follows, after you have labor&#8217;d so hard, you should talk so idlely! Tell me how many good young princes would do so, their fathers being so sick as yours at this time is.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Prince Henry">PRINCE.</speaker>
<line>Shall I tell thee one thing, Poins?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Poins">POINS.</speaker>
<line>Yes, faith, and let it be an excellent good thing.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Prince Henry">PRINCE.</speaker>
<line>It shall serve among wits of no higher breeding than thine.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Poins">POINS.</speaker>
<line>Go to, I stand the push of your one thing that you will tell.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Prince Henry">PRINCE.</speaker>
<line>Marry, I tell thee it is not meet that I should be sad, now my father is sick, albeit I could tell to thee&#8212;as to one it pleases me, for fault of a better, to call my friend&#8212;I could be sad, and sad indeed too.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Poins">POINS.</speaker>
<line>Very hardly, upon such a subject.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Prince Henry">PRINCE.</speaker>
<line>By this hand, thou thinkest me as far in the devil&#8217;s book as thou and Falstaff, for obduracy and persistency. Let the end try the man. But I tell thee, my heart bleeds inwardly that my father is so sick, and keeping such vile company as thou art hath in reason taken from me all ostentation of sorrow.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Poins">POINS.</speaker>
<line>The reason?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Prince Henry">PRINCE.</speaker>
<line>What wouldst thou think of me if I should weep?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Poins">POINS.</speaker>
<line>I would think thee a most princely hypocrite.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Prince Henry">PRINCE.</speaker>
<line>It would be every man&#8217;s thought, and thou art a blessed fellow to think as every man thinks. Never a man&#8217;s thought in the world keeps the road-way better than thine: every man would think me an hypocrite indeed. And what accites your most worshipful thought to think so?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Poins">POINS.</speaker>
<line>Why, because you have been so lewd and so much engraff&#8217;d to Falstaff.</line>

<line>Will you tell me, Master Shallow, how to choose a man? Care I for the limb, the thews, the stature, bulk, and big assemblance of a man? Give me the spirit, Master Shallow.

And this same half-fac&#8217;d fellow, Shadow, give me this man. He presents no mark to the enemy, the foeman may with as great aim level at the edge of a penknife. And for a retreat, how swiftly will this Feeble the woman&#8217;s tailor run off! O, give me the spare men, and spare me the great ones. Put me a caliver into Wart&#8217;s hand, Bardolph.</line>

<line>As I return, I will fetch off these justices. I do see the bottom of Justice Shallow. Lord, Lord, how subject we old men are to this vice of lying! This same starv&#8217;d justice hath done nothing but prate to me of the wildness of his youth, and the feats he hath done about Turnbull Street, and every third word a lie, duer paid to the hearer than the Turk&#8217;s tribute. I do remember him at Clement&#8217;s Inn, like a man made after supper of a cheese-paring. When &#8217;a was naked, he was for all the world like a fork&#8217;d redish, with a head fantastically carv&#8217;d upon it with a knife. &#8217;A was so forlorn, that his dimensions to any thick sight were invisible. &#8217;A was the very genius of famine, yet lecherous as a monkey, and the whores call&#8217;d him mandrake. &#8217;A came ever in the rearward of the fashion, and sung those tunes to the overscutch&#8217;d huswives that he heard the carmen whistle, and sware they were his fancies or his good-nights. And now is this Vice&#8217;s dagger become a squire, and talks as familiarly of John a&#8217; Gaunt as if he had been sworn brother to him, and I&#8217;ll be sworn &#8217;a ne&#8217;er saw him but once in the Tilt-yard, and then he burst his head for crowding among the marshal&#8217;s men. I saw it, and told John a&#8217; Gaunt he beat his own name, for you might have thrust him and all his apparel into an eel-skin. The case of a treble hoboy was a mansion for him, a court, and now has he land and beefs! Well, I&#8217;ll be acquainted with him if I return, and&#8217;t shall go hard but I&#8217;ll make him a philosopher&#8217;s two stones to me. If the young dace be a bait for the old pike, I see no reason in the law of nature but I may snap at him: let time shape, and there an end.</line>

<line>I have in equal balance justly weigh&#8217;d</line>
<line>What wrongs our arms may do, what wrongs we suffer,</line>

<line>We see which way the stream of time doth run,</line>

<line>And have the summary of all our griefs</line>
<line>(When time shall serve) to show in articles;</line>
<line>Which long ere this we offer&#8217;d to the King,</line>
<line>And might by no suit gain our audience.</line>
<line>When we are wrong&#8217;d and would unfold our griefs,</line>
<line>We are denied access unto his person</line>

<line>The King that lov&#8217;d him, as the state stood then,</line>
<line>Was force perforce compell&#8217;d to banish him;</line>
<line>And then that Henry Bullingbrook and he,</line>
<line>Being mounted and both roused in their seats,</line>

<line>Their armed staves in charge, their beavers down,</line>

<line>My father from the breast of Bullingbrook,</line>

<line>(His own life hung upon the staff he threw),</line>

<speaker long="Earl of Westmorland">WEST.</speaker>
<line>You speak, Lord Mowbray, now you know not what.</line>
<line>The Earl of Herford was reputed then</line>
<line>In England the most valiant gentleman.</line>
<line>Who knows on whom fortune would then have smil&#8217;d?</line>
<line>But if your father had been victor there,</line>
<line>He ne&#8217;er had borne it out of Coventry;</line>
<line>For all the country in a general voice</line>
<line>Cried hate upon him; and all their prayers and love</line>
<line>Were set on Herford, whom they doted on</line>
<line>And bless&#8217;d and grac&#8217;d and did, more than the King&#8212;</line>
<line>But this is mere digression from my purpose.</line>
<line>Here come I from our princely general</line>
<line>To know your griefs, to tell you from his Grace</line>
<line>That he will give you audience, and wherein</line>
<line>It shall appear that your demands are just,</line>
<line>You shall enjoy them, every thing set off</line>
<line>That might so much as think you enemies.</line>
</speech>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Earl of Westmorland">WEST.</speaker>
<line>Mowbray, you overween to take it so;</line>
<line>This offer comes from mercy, not from fear.</line>
<line>For lo, within a ken our army lies:</line>
<line>Upon mine honor, all too confident</line>
<line>To give admittance to a thought of fear.</line>
<line>Our battle is more full of names than yours,</line>
<line>Our men more perfect in the use of arms,</line>
<line>Our armor all as strong, our cause the best;</line>
<line>Then reason will our hearts should be as good.</line>
<line>Say you not then our offer is compell&#8217;d.</line>

<line>No, no, my lord, note this: the King is weary</line>

<line>Revives two greater in the heirs of life;</line>
<line>And therefore will he wipe his tables clean</line>
<line>And keep no tell-tale to his memory</line>
<line>That may repeat and history his loss</line>
<line>To new remembrance; for full well he knows</line>
<line>He cannot so precisely weed this land</line>
<line>As his misdoubts present occasion.</line>
<line>His foes are so enrooted with his friends</line>
<line>That, plucking to unfix an enemy,</line>
<line>He doth unfasten so and shake a friend,</line>
<line>So that this land, like an offensive wife</line>
<line>That hath enrag&#8217;d him on to offer strokes,</line>
<line>As he is striking, holds his infant up</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Lord Hastings">HAST.</speaker>
<line>Besides, the King hath wasted all his rods</line>

<line>I would you had the wit, &#8217;twere better than your dukedom. Good faith, this same young sober-blooded boy doth not love me, nor a man cannot make him laugh, but that&#8217;s no marvel, he drinks no wine. There&#8217;s never none of these demure boys come to any proof, for thin drink doth so over-cool their blood, and making many fish-meals, that they fall into a kind of male green-sickness, and then when they marry, they get wenches. They are generally fools and cowards, which some of us should be too, but for inflammation. A good sherris-sack hath a twofold operation in it. It ascends me into the brain, dries me there all the foolish and dull and crudy vapors which environ it, makes it apprehensive, quick, forgetive, full of nimble, fiery, and delectable shapes, which deliver&#8217;d o&#8217;er to the voice, the tongue, which is the birth, becomes excellent wit. The second property of your excellent sherris is the warming of the blood, which before (cold and settled) left the liver white and pale, which is the badge of pusillanimity and cowardice; but the sherris warms it, and makes it course from the inwards to the parts&#8217; extremes. It illumineth the face, which as a beacon gives warning to all the rest of this little kingdom, man, to arm, and then the vital commoners and inland petty spirits muster me all to their captain, the heart, who great and puff&#8217;d up with this retinue, doth any deed of courage; and this valor comes of sherris. So that skill in the weapon is nothing without sack (for that sets it a-work) and learning a mere hoard of gold kept by a devil, till sack commences it and sets it in act and use. Hereof comes it that Prince Harry is valiant, for the cold blood he did naturally inherit of his father, he hath, like lean, sterile, and bare land, manur&#8217;d, husbanded, and till&#8217;d with excellent endeavor of drinking good and good store of fertile sherris, that he is become very hot and valiant. If I had a thousand sons, the first humane principle I would teach them should be, to forswear thin potations and to addict themselves to sack.</line>

<line>Nor lose the good advantage of his grace</line>

<line>Before thy hour be ripe? O foolish youth,</line>

<line>Stay but a little, for my cloud of dignity</line>

<line>That it will quickly drop; my day is dim.</line>
<line>Thou hast stol&#8217;n that which after some few hours</line>
<line>Were thine without offense, and at my death</line>
<line>Thou hast seal&#8217;d up my expectation.</line>
<line>Thy life did manifest thou lov&#8217;dst me not,</line>
<line>And thou wilt have me die assur&#8217;d of it.</line>
<line>Thou hid&#8217;st a thousand daggers in thy thoughts,</line>
<line>Whom thou hast whetted on thy stony heart</line>
<line>To stab at half an hour of my life.</line>
<line>What, canst thou not forbear me half an hour?</line>
<line>Then get thee gone, and dig my grave thyself,</line>
<line>And bid the merry bells ring to thine ear</line>
<line>That thou art crowned, not that I am dead.</line>
<line>Let all the tears that should bedew my hearse</line>

<line>Which my most inward true and duteous spirit</line>

<line>God witness with me, when I here came in,</line>
<line>And found no course of breath within your Majesty,</line>
<line>How cold it strook my heart! If I do feign,</line>
<line>O, let me in my present wildness die,</line>
<line>And never live to show th&#8217; incredulous world</line>
<line>The noble change that I have purposed!</line>
<line>Coming to look on you, thinking you dead,</line>
<line>And dead almost, my liege, to think you were,</line>
<line>I spake unto this crown as having sense,</line>
<line>And thus upbraided it: &#8220;The care on thee depending</line>
<line>Hath fed upon the body of my father;</line>
<line>Therefore thou best of gold art worst of gold.</line>
<line>Other, less fine in carat, is more precious,</line>
<line>Preserving life in med&#8217;cine potable;</line>
<line>But thou, most fine, most honor&#8217;d, most renown&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Hast eat thy bearer up.&#8221; Thus, my most royal liege,</line>
<line>Accusing it, I put it on my head,</line>
<line>To try with it, as with an enemy</line>
<line>That had before my face murdered my father,</line>
<line>The quarrel of a true inheritor.</line>
<line>But if it did infect my blood with joy,</line>
<line>Or swell my thoughts to any strain of pride,</line>
<line>If any rebel or vain spirit of mine</line>
<line>Did with the least affection of a welcome</line>
<line>Give entertainment to the might of it,</line>
<line>Let God forever keep it from my head,</line>

<speaker long="King Henry the Fourth">KING.</speaker>
<line>O my son,</line>
<line>God put it in thy mind to take it hence,</line>
<line>That thou mightst win the more thy father&#8217;s love,</line>
<line>Pleading so wisely in excuse of it!</line>
<line>Come hither, Harry, sit thou by my bed,</line>
<line>And hear (I think) the very latest counsel</line>
<line>That ever I shall breathe. God knows, my son,</line>
<line>By what by-paths and indirect crook&#8217;d ways</line>
<line>I met this crown, and I myself know well</line>
<line>How troublesome it sate upon my head.</line>
<line>To thee it shall descend with better quiet,</line>
<line>Better opinion, better confirmation,</line>
<line>For all the soil of the achievement goes</line>
<line>With me into the earth. It seem&#8217;d in me</line>
<line>But as an honor snatch&#8217;d with boist&#8217;rous hand,</line>
<line>And I had many living to upbraid</line>
<line>My gain of it by their assistances,</line>
<line>Which daily grew to quarrel and to bloodshed,</line>
<line>Wounding supposed peace. All these bold fears</line>
<line>Thou seest with peril I have answered;</line>
<line>For all my reign hath been but as a scene</line>
<line>Acting that argument. And now my death</line>
<line>Changes the mood, for what in me was purchas&#8217;d</line>
<line>Falls upon thee in a more fairer sort;</line>
<line>So thou the garland wear&#8217;st successively.</line>
<line>Yet though thou stand&#8217;st more sure than I could do,</line>
<line>Thou art not firm enough, since griefs are green,</line>
<line>And all my friends, which thou must make thy friends,</line>
<line>Have but their stings and teeth newly ta&#8217;en out;</line>
<line>By whose fell working I was first advanc&#8217;d,</line>
<line>And by whose power I well might lodge a fear</line>
<line>To be again displac&#8217;d; which to avoid,</line>
<line>I cut them off, and had a purpose now</line>
<line>To lead out many to the Holy Land,</line>
<line>Lest rest and lying still might make them look</line>
<line>Too near unto my state. Therefore, my Harry,</line>
<line>Be it thy course to busy giddy minds</line>
<line>With foreign quarrels, that action, hence borne out,</line>
<line>May waste the memory of the former days.</line>
<line>More would I, but my lungs are wasted so</line>
<line>That strength of speech is utterly denied me.</line>

<line>If I were saw&#8217;d into quantities, I should make four dozen of such bearded hermits&#8217; staves as Master Shallow. It is a wonderful thing to see the semblable coherence of his men&#8217;s spirits and his. They, by observing him, do bear themselves like foolish justices; he, by conversing with them, is turn&#8217;d into a justice-like servingman. Their spirits are so married in conjunction with the participation of society that they flock together in consent, like so many wild geese. If I had a suit to Master Shallow, I would humor his men with the imputation of being near their master; if to his men, I would curry with Master Shallow that no man could better command his servants. It is certain that either wise bearing or ignorant carriage is caught, as men take diseases, one of another; therefore let men take heed of their company. I will devise matter enough out of this Shallow to keep Prince Harry in continual laughter the wearing out of six fashions, which is four terms, or two actions, and &#8217;a shall laugh without intervallums. O, it is much that a lie with a slight oath and a jest with a sad brow will do with a fellow that never had the ache in his shoulders!

<line>This new and gorgeous garment, majesty,</line>

<line>Brothers, you mix your sadness with some fear:</line>
<line>This is the English, not the Turkish court,</line>
<line>Not Amurath an Amurath succeeds,</line>
<line>But Harry Harry. Yet be sad, good brothers,</line>
<line>For by my faith it very well becomes you.</line>
<line>Sorrow so royally in you appears</line>
<line>That I will deeply put the fashion on</line>
<line>And wear it in my heart. Why then be sad,</line>
<line>But entertain no more of it, good brothers,</line>
<line>Than a joint burden laid upon us all.</line>
<line>For me, by heaven (I bid you be assur&#8217;d),</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll be your father and your brother too.</line>
<line>Let me but bear your love, I&#8217;ll bear your cares.</line>

<speaker long="Lord Chief Justice">CH. JUST.</speaker>
<line>I then did use the person of your father,</line>
<line>The image of his power lay then in me,</line>
<line>And in th&#8217; administration of his law,</line>
<line>Whiles I was busy for the commonwealth,</line>
<line>Your Highness pleased to forget my place,</line>
<line>The majesty and power of law and justice,</line>
<line>The image of the King whom I presented,</line>
<line>And strook me in my very seat of judgment;</line>
<line>Whereon (as an offender to your father)</line>
<line>I gave bold way to my authority,</line>
<line>And did commit you. If the deed were ill,</line>
<line>Be you contented, wearing now the garland,</line>
<line>To have a son set your decrees at nought?</line>
<line>To pluck down justice from your aweful bench?</line>
<line>To trip the course of law and blunt the sword</line>
<line>That guards the peace and safety of your person?</line>
<line>Nay more, to spurn at your most royal image,</line>
<line>And mock your workings in a second body?</line>
<line>Question your royal thoughts, make the case yours:</line>
<line>Be now the father and propose a son,</line>
<line>Hear your own dignity so much profan&#8217;d,</line>
<line>See your most dreadful laws so loosely slighted,</line>
<line>Behold yourself so by a son disdained;</line>
<line>And then imagine me taking your part,</line>
<line>And in your power soft silencing your son.</line>
<line>After this cold considerance, sentence me,</line>
<line>And as you are a king, speak in your state</line>
<line>What I have done that misbecame my place,</line>
<line>My person, or my liege&#8217;s sovereignty.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Prince Henry">PRINCE.</speaker>
<line>You are right justice, and you weigh this well,</line>
<line>Therefore still bear the balance and the sword,</line>
<line>And I do wish your honors may increase,</line>
<line>Till you do live to see a son of mine</line>
<line>Offend you and obey you, as I did.</line>
<line>So shall I live to speak my father&#8217;s words:</line>
<line>&#8220;Happy am I, that have a man so bold,</line>
<line>That dares do justice on my proper son;</line>
<line>And not less happy, having such a son</line>
<line>That would deliver up his greatness so</line>
<line>Into the hands of justice.&#8221; You did commit me;</line>
<line>For which I do commit into your hand</line>
<line>Th&#8217; unstained sword that you have us&#8217;d to bear,</line>
<line>With this remembrance, that you use the same</line>
<line>With the like bold, just, and impartial spirit</line>
<line>As you have done &#8217;gainst me. There is my hand.</line>
<line>You shall be as a father to my youth,</line>
<line>My voice shall sound as you do prompt mine ear,</line>
<line>And I will stoop and humble my intents</line>
<line>To your well-practic&#8217;d wise directions.</line>
<line>And, princes all, believe me, I beseech you,</line>
<line>My father is gone wild into his grave;</line>
<line>For in his tomb lie my affections,</line>
<line>And with his spirits sadly I survive,</line>
<line>To mock the expectation of the world,</line>
<line>To frustrate prophecies, and to rase out</line>
<line>Rotten opinion, who hath writ me down</line>
<line>After my seeming. The tide of blood in me</line>
<line>Hath proudly flow&#8217;d in vanity till now;</line>
<line>Now doth it turn and ebb back to the sea,</line>
<line>Where it shall mingle with the state of floods,</line>
<line>And flow henceforth in formal majesty.</line>
<line>Now call we our high court of parliament,</line>
<line>And let us choose such limbs of noble counsel</line>
<line>That the great body of our state may go</line>
<line>In equal rank with the best govern&#8217;d nation,</line>
<line>That war, or peace, or both at once, may be</line>
<line>As things acquainted and familiar to us,</line>
<line>In which you, father, shall have foremost hand.</line>
<line>Our coronation done, we will accite</line>
<line>(As I before rememb&#8217;red) all our state,</line>
<line>And (God consigning to my good intents)</line>
<line>No prince nor peer shall have just cause to say,</line>
<line>God shorten Harry&#8217;s happy life one day!</line>

<speaker long="Epilogue">EPILOGUE.</speaker>
<line>First my fear, then my cur&#8217;sy, last my speech. My fear, is your displeasure, my cur&#8217;sy, my duty, and my speech, to beg your pardons. If you look for a good speech now, you undo me, for what I have to say is of mine own making, and what indeed (I should say) will (I doubt) prove mine own marring. But to the purpose, and so to the venture. Be it known to you, as it is very well, I was lately here in the end of a displeasing play, to pray your patience for it and to promise you a better. I meant indeed to pay you with this, which if like an ill venture it come unluckily home, I break, and you, my gentle creditors, lose. Here I promis&#8217;d you I would be, and here I commit my body to your mercies. Bate me some, and I will pay you some, and (as most debtors do) promise you infinitely; and so I kneel down before you&#8212;but, indeed, to pray for the Queen.</line>
<line>If my tongue cannot entreat you to acquit me, will you command me to use my legs? And yet that were but light payment, to dance out of your debt. But a good conscience will make any possible satisfaction, and so would I. All the gentlewomen here have forgiven me; if the gentlemen will not, then the gentlemen do not agree with the gentlewomen, which was never seen in such an assembly.</line>
<line>One word more, I beseech you. If you be not too much cloy&#8217;d with fat meat, our humble author will continue the story, with Sir John in it, and make you merry with fair Katherine of France, where (for any thing I know) Falstaff shall die of a sweat, unless already &#8217;a be kill&#8217;d with your hard opinions; for Oldcastle died a martyr, and this is not the man. My tongue is weary, when my legs are too, I will bid you good night.</line>
