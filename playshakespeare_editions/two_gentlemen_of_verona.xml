<line globalnumber="1576" number="1" form="prose">When a man&#8217;s servant shall play the cur with him, look you, it goes hard: one that I brought up of a puppy; one that I sav&#8217;d from drowning, when three or four of his blind brothers and sisters went to it. I have taught him, even as one would say precisely, &#8220;Thus I would teach a dog.&#8221; I was sent to deliver him as a present to Mistress Silvia from my master; and I came no sooner into the dining-chamber but he steps me to her trencher and steals her capon&#8217;s leg. O, &#8217;tis a foul thing when a cur cannot keep himself in all companies! I would have (as one should say) one that takes upon him to be a dog indeed, to be, as it were, a dog at all things. If I had not had more wit than he, to take a fault upon me that he did, I think verily he had been hang&#8217;d for&#8217;t; sure as I live he had suffer&#8217;d for&#8217;t. You shall judge: he thrusts me himself into the company of three or four gentleman-like dogs, under the Duke&#8217;s table. He had not been there (bless the mark!) a pissing-while, but all the chamber smelt him. &#8220;Out with the dog,&#8221; says one. &#8220;What cur is that?&#8221; says another. &#8220;Whip him out,&#8221; says the third. &#8220;Hang him up,&#8221; says the Duke. I, having been acquainted with the smell before, knew it was Crab, and goes me to the fellow that whips the dogs: &#8220;Friend,&#8221; quoth I, &#8220;you mean to whip the dog?&#8221; &#8220;Ay, marry, do I,&#8221; quoth he. &#8220;You do him the more wrong,&#8221; quoth I, &#8220;&#8217;twas I did the thing you wot of.&#8221; He makes me no more ado, but whips me out of the chamber. How many masters would do this for his servant? Nay, I&#8217;ll be sworn, I have sat in the stocks for puddings he hath stol&#8217;n, otherwise he had been executed; I have stood on the pillory for geese he hath kill&#8217;d, otherwise he had suffer&#8217;d for&#8217;t. Thou think&#8217;st not of this now. Nay, I remember the trick you serv&#8217;d me, when I took my leave of Madam Silvia. Did not I bid thee still mark me, and do as I do? When didst thou see me heave up my leg and make water against a gentlewoman&#8217;s farthingale? Didst thou ever see me do such a trick?</line>
