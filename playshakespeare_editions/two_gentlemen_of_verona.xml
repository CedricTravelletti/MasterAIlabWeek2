You were wont, when you laugh&#8217;d, to crow like a cock; when you walk&#8217;d, to walk like one of the lions; when you fasted, it was presently after dinner; when you look&#8217;d sadly, it was for want of money: and now you are metamorphis&#8217;d with a mistress, that when I look on you, I can hardly think you my master.</line>

I have receiv&#8217;d my proportion, like the prodigious son, and am going with Sir Proteus to the Imperial&#8217;s court. I think Crab my dog be the sourest-natur&#8217;d dog that lives: my mother weeping, my father wailing, my sister crying, our maid howling, our cat wringing her hands, and all our house in a great perplexity, yet did not this cruel-hearted cur shed one tear. He is a stone, a very pibble stone, and has no more pity in him than a dog. A Jew would have wept to have seen our parting; why, my grandam, having no eyes, look you, wept herself blind at my parting. Nay, I&#8217;ll show you the manner of it. This shoe is my father; no, this left shoe is my father; no, no, this left shoe is my mother; nay, that cannot be so neither; yes, it is so, it is so&#8212;it hath the worser sole. This shoe, with the hole in it, is my mother, and this my father&#8212;a vengeance on&#8217;t! There &#8217;tis. Now, sir, this staff is my sister, for, look you, she is as white as a lily and as small as a wand. This hat is Nan, our maid. I am the dog&#8212;no, the dog is himself, and I am the dog&#8212;O! The dog is me, and I am myself; ay, so, so. Now come I to my father: &#8220;Father, your blessing.&#8221; Now should not the shoe speak a word for weeping; now should I kiss my father; well, he weeps on. Now come I to my mother. O that she could speak now like a wood woman! Well, I kiss her; why, there &#8217;tis; here&#8217;s my mother&#8217;s breath up and down. Now come I to my sister; mark the moan she makes. Now the dog all this while sheds not a tear, nor speaks a word; but see how I lay the dust with my tears.</line>

<line number="1" form="prose">When a man&#8217;s servant shall play the cur with him, look you, it goes hard: one that I brought up of a puppy; one that I sav&#8217;d from drowning, when three or four of his blind brothers and sisters went to it. I have taught him, even as one would say precisely, &#8220;Thus I would teach a dog.&#8221; I was sent to deliver him as a present to Mistress Silvia from my master; and I came no sooner into the dining-chamber but he steps me to her trencher and steals her capon&#8217;s leg. O, &#8217;tis a foul thing when a cur cannot keep himself in all companies! I would have (as one should say) one that takes upon him to be a dog indeed, to be, as it were, a dog at all things. If I had not had more wit than he, to take a fault upon me that he did, I think verily he had been hang&#8217;d for&#8217;t; sure as I live he had suffer&#8217;d for&#8217;t. You shall judge: he thrusts me himself into the company of three or four gentleman-like dogs, under the Duke&#8217;s table. He had not been there (bless the mark!) a pissing-while, but all the chamber smelt him. &#8220;Out with the dog,&#8221; says one. &#8220;What cur is that?&#8221; says another. &#8220;Whip him out,&#8221; says the third. &#8220;Hang him up,&#8221; says the Duke. I, having been acquainted with the smell before, knew it was Crab, and goes me to the fellow that whips the dogs: &#8220;Friend,&#8221; quoth I, &#8220;you mean to whip the dog?&#8221; &#8220;Ay, marry, do I,&#8221; quoth he. &#8220;You do him the more wrong,&#8221; quoth I, &#8220;&#8217;twas I did the thing you wot of.&#8221; He makes me no more ado, but whips me out of the chamber. How many masters would do this for his servant? Nay, I&#8217;ll be sworn, I have sat in the stocks for puddings he hath stol&#8217;n, otherwise he had been executed; I have stood on the pillory for geese he hath kill&#8217;d, otherwise he had suffer&#8217;d for&#8217;t. Thou think&#8217;st not of this now. Nay, I remember the trick you serv&#8217;d me, when I took my leave of Madam Silvia. Did not I bid thee still mark me, and do as I do? When didst thou see me heave up my leg and make water against a gentlewoman&#8217;s farthingale? Didst thou ever see me do such a trick?</line>
