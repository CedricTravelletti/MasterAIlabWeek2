<speaker long="Prologue">PROLOGUE.</speaker>
<line>In Troy, there lies the scene. From isles of Greece</line>
<line>The princes orgulous, their high blood chaf&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Have to the port of Athens sent their ships</line>
<line>Fraught with the ministers and instruments</line>
<line>Of cruel war. Sixty and nine, that wore</line>
<line>Their crownets regal, from th&#8217; Athenian bay</line>
<line>Put forth toward Phrygia, and their vow is made</line>
<line>To ransack Troy, within whose strong immures</line>
<line>The ravish&#8217;d Helen, Menelaus&#8217; queen,</line>
<line>With wanton Paris sleeps&#8212;and that&#8217;s the quarrel.</line>
<line>To Tenedos they come,</line>
<line>And the deep-drawing barks do there disgorge</line>
<line>Their warlike fraughtage. Now on Dardan plains</line>
<line>The fresh and yet unbruised Greeks do pitch</line>
<line>Their brave pavilions. Priam&#8217;s six-gated city,</line>
<line>Dardan and Timbria, Helias, Chetas, Troien,</line>
<line>And Antenorides, with massy staples</line>
<line>And corresponsive and fulfilling bolts</line>
<line>Sperr up the sons of Troy.</line>
<line>Now expectation, tickling skittish spirits,</line>
<line>On one and other side, Troyan and Greek,</line>
<line>Sets all on hazard&#8212;and hither am I come,</line>
<line>A prologue arm&#8217;d, but not in confidence</line>
<line>Of author&#8217;s pen or actor&#8217;s voice, but suited</line>
<line>In like conditions as our argument,</line>
<line>To tell you, fair beholders, that our play</line>
<line>Leaps o&#8217;er the vaunt and firstlings of those broils,</line>
<line>Beginning in the middle; starting thence away</line>
<line>To what may be digested in a play.</line>
<line>Like or find fault, do as your pleasures are,</line>
<line>Now good or bad, &#8217;tis but the chance of war.</line>

<line>Call here my varlet, I&#8217;ll unarm again.</line>
<line>Why should I war without the walls of Troy,</line>
<line>That find such cruel battle here within?</line>
<line>Each Troyan that is master of his heart,</line>
<line>Let him to field, Troilus, alas, hath none.</line>

<line>Will this gear ne&#8217;er be mended?</line>

<speech>
<speaker long="Troilus">TRO.</speaker>
<line>The Greeks are strong, and skillful to their strength,</line>
<line>Fierce to their skill, and to their fierceness valiant,</line>
<line>But I am weaker than a woman&#8217;s tear,</line>

<speech>
<speaker long="Pandarus">PAN.</speaker>
<line>Well, I have told you enough of this. For my part, I&#8217;ll not meddle nor make no farther. 
He that will have a cake out of the wheat must tarry the grinding.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Troilus">TRO.</speaker>
<line>Have I not tarried?</line>

<speech>

<line>Have I not tarried?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Pandarus">PAN.</speaker>
<line>Ay, the bolting; but you must tarry the leavening.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Troilus">TRO.</speaker>
<line>Still have I tarried.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Pandarus">PAN.</speaker>
<line>Ay, to the leavening, but here&#8217;s yet in the word &#8220;hereafter&#8221; the kneading, the making of the cake, the heating the oven, and the baking; nay, you must stay the cooling too, or ye may chance burn your lips.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Troilus">TRO.</speaker>
<line>Patience herself, what goddess e&#8217;er she be,</line>
<line>Doth lesser blench at suff&#8217;rance than I do.</line>
<line>At Priam&#8217;s royal table do I sit,</line>
<line>And when fair Cressid comes into my thoughts&#8212;</line>
<line>So, traitor, then she comes when she is thence.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Pandarus">PAN.</speaker>
<line>Well, she look&#8217;d yesternight fairer than ever</line>
<line>I saw her look, or any woman else.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Troilus">TRO.</speaker>
<line>I was about to tell thee&#8212;when my heart,</line>
<line>As wedged with a sigh, would rive in twain,</line>
<line>Lest Hector or my father should perceive me,</line>
<line>I have (as when the sun doth light a-scorn)</line>
<line>Buried this sigh in wrinkle of a smile,</line>
<line>But sorrow that is couch&#8217;d in seeming gladness</line>
<line>Is like that mirth fate turns to sudden sadness.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Pandarus">PAN.</speaker>
<line>And her hair were not somewhat darker than Helen&#8217;s&#8212;well, go to!&#8212;there were no more comparison between the women! 
But for my part, she is my kinswoman; I would not, as they term it, praise her, but I would somebody had heard her talk yesterday as I did. 
I will not dispraise your sister Cassandra&#8217;s wit, but&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Troilus">TRO.</speaker>
<line>O Pandarus! I tell thee, Pandarus&#8212;</line>
<line>When I do tell thee there my hopes lie drown&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Reply not in how many fathoms deep</line>
<line>They lie indrench&#8217;d. I tell thee I am mad</line>
<line>In Cressid&#8217;s love; thou answer&#8217;st she is fair,</line>
<line>Pourest in the open ulcer of my heart</line>
<line>Her eyes, her hair, her cheek, her gait, her voice,</line>
<line>Handiest in thy discourse, O, that her hand,</line>
<line>In whose comparison all whites are ink</line>
<line>Writing their own reproach; to whose soft seizure</line>
<line>The cygnet&#8217;s down is harsh, and spirit of sense</line>
<line>Hard as the palm of ploughman. This thou tell&#8217;st me,</line>
<line>As true thou tell&#8217;st me, when I say I love her,</line>
<line>But saying thus, in stead of oil and balm,</line>
<line>Thou lay&#8217;st in every gash that love hath given me</line>
<line>The knife that made it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Pandarus">PAN.</speaker>
<line>I speak no more than truth.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Troilus">TRO.</speaker>
<line>Thou dost not speak so much.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Pandarus">PAN.</speaker>
<line>Faith, I&#8217;ll not meddle in it, let her be as she is; if she be fair, &#8217;tis the better for her; and she be not, she has the mends in her own hands.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Troilus">TRO.</speaker>
<line>Good Pandarus! How now, Pandarus?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Pandarus">PAN.</speaker>
<line>I have had my labor for my travail; ill thought on of her, and ill thought on of you; gone between and between, but small thanks for my labor.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Troilus">TRO.</speaker>
<line>What, art thou angry, Pandarus? What, with me?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Pandarus">PAN.</speaker>
<line>Because she&#8217;s kin to me, therefore she&#8217;s not so fair as Helen. And she were not kin to me, she would be as fair a&#8217; 
Friday as Helen is on Sunday. But what care I? I care not and she were a blackamoor, &#8217;tis all one to me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Troilus">TRO.</speaker>
<line>Say I she is not fair?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Pandarus">PAN.</speaker>
<line>I do not care whether you do or no. She&#8217;s a fool to stay behind her father, let her to the Greeks; and so I&#8217;ll tell her the next time I see her. 
For my part, I&#8217;ll meddle nor make no more i&#8217; th&#8217; matter.</line>

<line>So he says here.</line>

<speech>

<line>True, he was so; I know the cause too. He&#8217;ll lay about him today, I can tell them that, and there&#8217;s Troilus will not come far behind him.

<speech>
<speaker long="Cressida">CRES.</speaker>
<line>What, is he angry too?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Pandarus">PAN.</speaker>
<line>Who, Troilus? Troilus is the better man of the two.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Cressida">CRES.</speaker>
<line>O Jupiter, there&#8217;s no comparison.</line>
</speech>

<line>Ay, if I ever saw him before and knew him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Pandarus">PAN.</speaker>
<line>Well, I say Troilus is Troilus.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Cressida">CRES.</speaker>
<line>Then you say as I say, for I am sure he is not Hector.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Pandarus">PAN.</speaker>
<line>No, nor Hector is not Troilus in some degrees.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Cressida">CRES.</speaker>
<line>&#8217;Tis just to each of them; he is himself.</line>
</speech>

<line>Himself? Alas, poor Troilus, I would he were!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Cressida">CRES.</speaker>

<speech>
<speaker long="Pandarus">PAN.</speaker>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Cressida">CRES.</speaker>
<line>He is not Hector.</line>
</speech>

<speech>

<line>Himself? No! He&#8217;s not himself. Would &#8217;a were himself! Well, the gods are above, time must friend or end. 
Well, Troilus, well, I would my heart were in her body. No, Hector is not a better man than Troilus.</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Pandarus">PAN.</speaker>
<line>You have no judgment, niece. Helen herself swore th&#8217; other day that Troilus, for a brown favor (for so &#8217;tis, I must confess)&#8212;not brown neither&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Cressida">CRES.</speaker>
<line>No, but brown.</line>
</speech>

<speech>

<line>Faith, to say truth, brown and not brown.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Cressida">CRES.</speaker>
<line>To say the truth, true and not true.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Pandarus">PAN.</speaker>
<line>She prais&#8217;d his complexion above Paris.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Cressida">CRES.</speaker>
<line>Why, Paris hath color enough.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Pandarus">PAN.</speaker>
<line>So he has.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Cressida">CRES.</speaker>
<line>Then Troilus should have too much: if she prais&#8217;d him above, his complexion is higher than his. 
He having color enough, and the other higher, is too flaming a praise for a good complexion. 
I had as lieve Helen&#8217;s golden tongue had commended Troilus for a copper nose.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Pandarus">PAN.</speaker>
<line>I swear to you, I think Helen loves him better than Paris.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Cressida">CRES.</speaker>
<line>Then she&#8217;s a merry Greek indeed.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Pandarus">PAN.</speaker>
<line>Nay, I am sure she does. She came to him th&#8217; other day into the compass&#8217;d window&#8212;and you know he has not past three or four hairs on his chin&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Cressida">CRES.</speaker>
<line>Indeed a tapster&#8217;s arithmetic may soon bring his particulars therein to a total.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Pandarus">PAN.</speaker>
<line>Why, he is very young, and yet will he, within three pound, lift as much as his brother Hector.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Cressida">CRES.</speaker>
<line>Is he so young a man and so old a lifter?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Pandarus">PAN.</speaker>
<line>But to prove to you that Helen loves him: she came and puts me her white hand to his cloven chin&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Cressida">CRES.</speaker>
<line>Juno have mercy! How came it cloven?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Pandarus">PAN.</speaker>
<line>Why, you know &#8217;tis dimpled. I think his smiling becomes him better than any man in all Phrygia.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Cressida">CRES.</speaker>
<line>O, he smiles valiantly.</line>
</speech>

<speech>

<line>Why, go to then. But to prove to you that Helen loves Troilus&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Cressida">CRES.</speaker>
<line>Troilus will stand to the proof, if you&#8217;ll prove it so.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Pandarus">PAN.</speaker>
<line>Troilus! Why, he esteems her no more than I esteem an addle egg.</line>

<line>Without the rack.</line>
</speech>

<speaker long="Cressida">CRES.</speaker>
<line>Alas, poor chin! Many a wart is richer.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Pandarus">PAN.</speaker>

<speaker long="Cressida">CRES.</speaker>
<line>With millstones.</line>

<speaker long="Cressida">CRES.</speaker>
<line>But there was a more temperate fire under the pot of her eyes. Did her eyes run o&#8217;er too?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Pandarus">PAN.</speaker>
<line>And Hector laugh&#8217;d.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Cressida">CRES.</speaker>
<line>At what was all this laughing?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Pandarus">PAN.</speaker>
<line>Marry, at the white hair that Helen spied on Troilus&#8217; chin.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Cressida">CRES.</speaker>
<line>And&#8217;t had been a green hair, I should have laugh&#8217;d too.</line>
</speech>

<speech>

<line>They laugh&#8217;d not so much at the hair as at his pretty answer.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Cressida">CRES.</speaker>
<line>What was his answer?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Pandarus">PAN.</speaker>
<line>Quoth she, &#8220;Here&#8217;s but two and fifty hairs on your chin&#8212;and one of them is white.&#8221;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Cressida">CRES.</speaker>
<line>This is her question.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Pandarus">PAN.</speaker>
<line>That&#8217;s true, make no question of that. &#8220;Two and fifty hairs,&#8221; quoth he, &#8220;and one white. 
That white hair is my father, and all the rest are his sons.&#8221; &#8220;Jupiter,&#8221; quoth she, &#8220;which of these hairs is 
Paris my husband?&#8221; &#8220;The fork&#8217;d one,&#8221; quoth he, &#8220;pluck&#8217;t out, and give it him.&#8221; But there was such laughing! And Helen so blush&#8217;d, and Paris so chaf&#8217;d, and all the rest so laugh&#8217;d, that it pass&#8217;d.</line>

<line>Princes:</line>
<line>What grief hath set these jaundies o&#8217;er your cheeks?</line>
<line>The ample proposition that hope makes</line>
<line>In all designs begun on earth below</line>
<line>Fails in the promis&#8217;d largeness. Checks and disasters</line>
<line>Grow in the veins of actions highest rear&#8217;d,</line>
<line>As knots, by the conflux of meeting sap,</line>
<line>Infects the sound pine, and diverts his grain</line>
<line>Tortive and errant from his course of growth.</line>
<line>Nor, princes, is it matter new to us</line>
<line>That we come short of our suppose so far</line>
<line>That after seven years&#8217; siege yet Troy walls stand,</line>
<line>Sith every action that hath gone before,</line>
<line>Whereof we have record, trial did draw</line>
<line>Bias and thwart, not answering the aim</line>
<line>And that unbodied figure of the thought</line>
<line>That gave&#8217;t surmised shape. Why then, you princes,</line>
<line>Do you with cheeks abash&#8217;d behold our works,</line>
<line>And call them shames which are indeed nought else</line>
<line>But the protractive trials of great Jove</line>
<line>To find persistive constancy in men?</line>
<line>The fineness of which metal is not found</line>
<line>In fortune&#8217;s love; for then the bold and coward,</line>
<line>The wise and fool, the artist and unread,</line>
<line>The hard and soft, seem all affin&#8217;d and kin;</line>
<line>But in the wind and tempest of her frown,</line>
<line>Distinction, with a broad and powerful fan,</line>
<line>Puffing at all, winnows the light away,</line>
<line>And what hath mass or matter, by itself</line>
<line>Lies rich in virtue and unmingled.</line>

<line>With due observance of thy godlike seat,</line>
<line>Great Agamemnon, Nestor shall apply</line>
<line>Thy latest words. In the reproof of chance</line>
<line>Lies the true proof of men: the sea being smooth,</line>
<line>How many shallow bauble boats dare sail</line>
<line>Upon her patient breast, making their way</line>
<line>With those of nobler bulk!</line>
<line>But let the ruffian Boreas once enrage</line>
<line>The gentle Thetis, and anon behold</line>
<line>The strong-ribb&#8217;d bark through liquid mountains cut,</line>
<line>Bounding between the two moist elements,</line>
<line>Like Perseus&#8217; horse. Where&#8217;s then the saucy boat</line>
<line>Whose weak untimber&#8217;d sides but even now</line>
<line>Corrivall&#8217;d greatness? Either to harbor fled,</line>
<line>Or made a toast for Neptune. Even so</line>
<line>Doth valor&#8217;s show and valor&#8217;s worth divide</line>
<line>In storms of fortune; for in her ray and brightness</line>
<line>The herd hath more annoyance by the breeze</line>
<line>Than by the tiger; but when the splitting wind</line>
<line>Makes flexible the knees of knotted oaks,</line>
<line>And flies fled under shade, why then the thing of courage,</line>
<line>As rous&#8217;d with rage, with rage doth sympathize,</line>

<speaker long="Ulysses">ULYSS.</speaker>
<line>Troy, yet upon his bases, had been down,</line>
<line>And the great Hector&#8217;s sword had lack&#8217;d a master,</line>
<line>But for these instances:</line>
<line>The specialty of rule hath been neglected,</line>
<line>And look how many Grecian tents do stand</line>
<line>Hollow upon this plain, so many hollow factions.</line>
<line>When that the general is not like the hive</line>
<line>To whom the foragers shall all repair,</line>
<line>What honey is expected? Degree being vizarded,</line>
<line>Th&#8217; unworthiest shows as fairly in the mask.</line>
<line>The heavens themselves, the planets, and this centre</line>
<line>Observe degree, priority, and place,</line>
<line>Insisture, course, proportion, season, form,</line>
<line>Office, and custom, in all line of order;</line>
<line>And therefore is the glorious planet Sol</line>
<line>In noble eminence enthron&#8217;d and spher&#8217;d</line>
<line>Amidst the other; whose med&#8217;cinable eye</line>
<line>Corrects the ill aspects of planets evil,</line>
<line>And posts like the commandment of a king,</line>
<line>Sans check, to good and bad. But when the planets</line>
<line>In evil mixture to disorder wander,</line>
<line>What plagues and what portents, what mutiny!</line>
<line>What raging of the sea, shaking of earth!</line>
<line>Commotion in the winds!, frights, changes, horrors</line>
<line>Divert and crack, rend and deracinate</line>
<line>The unity and married calm of states</line>
<line>Quite from their fixure! O, when degree is shak&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Which is the ladder of all high designs,</line>
<line>The enterprise is sick. How could communities,</line>
<line>Degrees in schools, and brotherhoods in cities,</line>
<line>Peaceful commerce from dividable shores,</line>
<line>The primogenity and due of birth,</line>
<line>Prerogative of age, crowns, sceptres, laurels,</line>
<line>But by degree stand in authentic place?</line>
<line>Take but degree away, untune that string,</line>
<line>And hark what discord follows. Each thing meets</line>
<line>In mere oppugnancy: the bounded waters</line>
<line>Should lift their bosoms higher than the shores,</line>
<line>And make a sop of all this solid globe;</line>
<line>Strength should be lord of imbecility,</line>
<line>And the rude son should strike his father dead;</line>
<line>Force should be right, or rather, right and wrong</line>
<line>(Between whose endless jar justice resides)</line>
<line>Should lose their names, and so should justice too!</line>
<line>Then every thing include itself in power,</line>
<line>Power into will, will into appetite,</line>
<line>And appetite, an universal wolf</line>
<line>(So doubly seconded with will and power),</line>
<line>Must make perforce an universal prey,</line>
<line>And last eat up himself. Great Agamemnon,</line>
<line>This chaos, when degree is suffocate,</line>
<line>Follows the choking,</line>
<line>And this neglection of degree it is</line>
<line>That by a pace goes backward with a purpose</line>
<line>It hath to climb. The general&#8217;s disdain&#8217;d</line>
<line>By him one step below, he by the next,</line>
<line>That next by him beneath; so every step,</line>
<line>Exampled by the first pace that is sick</line>
<line>Of his superior, grows to an envious fever</line>
<line>Of pale and bloodless emulation,</line>
<line>And &#8217;tis this fever that keeps Troy on foot,</line>
<line>Not her own sinews. To end a tale of length,</line>
<line>Troy in our weakness stands, not in her strength.</line>

<line>The nature of the sickness found, Ulysses,</line>
<line>What is the remedy?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Ulysses">ULYSS.</speaker>
<line>The great Achilles, whom opinion crowns</line>
<line>The sinow and the forehand of our host,</line>
<line>Having his ear full of his airy fame,</line>
<line>Grows dainty of his worth, and in his tent</line>
<line>Lies mocking our designs. With him Patroclus</line>
<line>Upon a lazy bed the livelong day</line>
<line>Breaks scurril jests,</line>
<line>And with ridiculous and awkward action,</line>
<line>Which, slanderer, he imitation calls,</line>
<line>He pageants us. Sometime, great Agamemnon,</line>
<line>Thy topless deputation he puts on,</line>
<line>And like a strutting player, whose conceit</line>
<line>Lies in his hamstring, and doth think it rich</line>
<line>To hear the wooden dialogue and sound</line>
<line>&#8217;Twixt his stretch&#8217;d footing and the scaffoldage,</line>
<line>Such to-be-pitied and o&#8217;er-wrested seeming</line>
<line>He acts thy greatness in; and when he speaks,</line>
<line>&#8217;Tis like a chime a-mending, with terms unsquar&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Which from the tongue of roaring Typhon dropp&#8217;d</line>
<line>Would seem hyperboles. At this fusty stuff</line>
<line>The large Achilles, on his press&#8217;d bed lolling,</line>
<line>From his deep chest laughs out a loud applause,</line>
<line>Cries, &#8220;Excellent! &#8217;Tis Agamemnon right!</line>
<line>Now play me Nestor, hem, and stroke thy beard,</line>
<line>As he being dress&#8217;d to some oration.&#8221;</line>
<line>That&#8217;s done, as near as the extremest ends</line>
<line>Of parallels, as like as Vulcan and his wife;</line>
<line>Yet god Achilles still cries, &#8220;Excellent!</line>
<line>&#8217;Tis Nestor right. Now play him me, Patroclus,</line>
<line>Arming to answer in a night alarm.&#8221;</line>
<line>And then forsooth the faint defects of age</line>
<line>Must be the scene of mirth; to cough and spit,</line>
<line>And with a palsy fumbling on his gorget,</line>
<line>Shake in and out the rivet; and at this sport</line>
<line>Sir Valor dies; cries, &#8220;O, enough, Patroclus,</line>
<line>Or give me ribs of steel! I shall split all</line>
<line>In pleasure of my spleen.&#8221; And in this fashion,</line>
<line>All our abilities, gifts, natures, shapes,</line>
<line>Severals and generals of grace exact,</line>
<line>Achievements, plots, orders, preventions,</line>
<line>Excitements to the field, or speech for truce,</line>
<line>Success or loss, what is or is not, serves</line>

<line>And in the imitation of these twain&#8212;</line>
<line>Who, as Ulysses says, opinion crowns</line>

<line>Ajax is grown self-will&#8217;d, and bears his head</line>
<line>In such a rein, in full as proud a place</line>
<line>As broad Achilles; keeps his tent like him,</line>
<line>Makes factious feasts, rails on our state of war,</line>
<line>Bold as an oracle, and sets Thersites,</line>
<line>A slave whose gall coins slanders like a mint,</line>
<line>To match us in comparisons with dirt,</line>
<line>To weaken or discredit our exposure,</line>
<line>How rank soever rounded in with danger.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Ulysses">ULYSS.</speaker>
<line>They tax our policy, and call it cowardice,</line>
<line>Count wisdom as no member of the war,</line>
<line>Forestall prescience, and esteem no act</line>
<line>But that of hand. The still and mental parts,</line>
<line>That do contrive how many hands shall strike</line>
<line>When fitness calls them on, and know by measure</line>
<line>Of their observant toil the enemies&#8217; weight&#8212;</line>
<line>Why, this hath not a finger&#8217;s dignity.</line>
<line>They call this bed-work, mapp&#8217;ry, closet-war,</line>
<line>So that the ram that batters down the wall,</line>
<line>For the great swinge and rudeness of his poise,</line>
<line>They place before his hand that made the engine,</line>
<line>Or those that with the fineness of their souls</line>
<line>By reason guide his execution.</line>

<line>What glory our Achilles shares from Hector,</line>
<line>Were he not proud, we all should share with him.</line>
<line>But he already is too insolent;</line>
<line>And it were better parch in Afric sun</line>

<line>Should he scape Hector fair. If he were foil&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Why then we do our main opinion crush</line>
<line>In taint of our best man. No, make a lott&#8217;ry,</line>
<line>And by device let blockish Ajax draw</line>
<line>The sort to fight with Hector; among ourselves</line>
<line>Give him allowance for the better man,</line>
<line>For that will physic the great Myrmidon,</line>
<line>Who broils in loud applause, and make him fall</line>
<line>His crest that prouder than blue Iris bends.</line>
<line>If the dull brainless Ajax come safe off,</line>
<line>We&#8217;ll dress him up in voices; if he fail,</line>
<line>Yet go we under our opinion still</line>
<line>That we have better men. But hit or miss,</line>

<line>Paris and Troilus, you have both said well,</line>

<line>Have gloz&#8217;d, but superficially, not much</line>
<line>Unlike young men, whom Aristotle thought</line>
<line>Unfit to hear moral philosophy.</line>
<line>The reasons you allege do more conduce</line>
<line>To the hot passion of distemp&#8217;red blood</line>
<line>Than to make up a free determination</line>
<line>&#8217;Twixt right and wrong; for pleasure and revenge</line>
<line>Have ears more deaf than adders to the voice</line>
<line>Of any true decision. Nature craves</line>
<line>All dues be rend&#8217;red to their owners: now,</line>
<line>What nearer debt in all humanity</line>
<line>Than wife is to the husband? If this law</line>
<line>Of nature be corrupted through affection,</line>
<line>And that great minds, of partial indulgence</line>
<line>To their benumbed wills, resist the same,</line>
<line>There is a law in each well-order&#8217;d nation</line>
<line>To curb those raging appetites that are</line>
<line>Most disobedient and refractory.</line>
<line>If Helen then be wife to Sparta&#8217;s king,</line>
<line>As it is known she is, these moral laws</line>
<line>Of nature and of nations speak aloud</line>
<line>To have her back return&#8217;d. Thus to persist</line>
<line>In doing wrong extenuates not wrong,</line>
<line>But makes it much more heavy. Hector&#8217;s opinion</line>

<line>How now, Thersites? What, lost in the labyrinth of thy fury? Shall the elephant Ajax carry it thus? He beats me, and I rail at him. O worthy satisfaction! 
Would it were otherwise: that I could beat him, whilst he rail&#8217;d at me. &#8217;Sfoot, I&#8217;ll learn to conjure and raise devils, but I&#8217;ll see some issue of my spiteful execrations. Then there&#8217;s Achilles, a rare enginer! If Troy be not taken till these two undermine it, the walls will stand till they fall of themselves. 
O thou great thunder-darter of Olympus, forget that thou art Jove, the king of gods, and, Mercury, lose all the serpentine craft of thy caduceus, if ye take not that little little less than little wit from them that they have, which short-arm&#8217;d ignorance itself knows is so abundant scarce, it will not in circumvention deliver a fly from a spider, without drawing their massy irons and cutting the web! After this, the vengeance on the whole camp! Or rather, the Neapolitan bone-ache! For that methinks is the curse depending on those that war for a placket. I have said my prayers, and devil Envy say amen.

<line>The beauty that is borne here in the face</line>

<line>I do not strain at the position&#8212;</line>
<line>It is familiar&#8212;but at the author&#8217;s drift,</line>
<line>Who in his circumstance expressly proves</line>
<line>That no man is the lord of any thing,</line>

<line>Where th&#8217; are extended; who like an arch reverb&#8217;rate</line>
<line>The voice again, or like a gate of steel,</line>
<line>Fronting the sun, receives and renders back</line>
<line>His figure and his heat. I was much rapt in this,</line>
<line>And apprehended here immediately</line>
<line>Th&#8217; unknown Ajax.</line>
<line>Heavens, what a man is there! A very horse,</line>
<line>That has he knows not what. Nature, what things there are</line>
<line>Most abject in regard, and dear in use!</line>
<line>What things again most dear in the esteem,</line>
<line>And poor in worth! Now shall we see tomorrow&#8212;</line>
<line>An act that very chance doth throw upon him&#8212;</line>
<line>Ajax renown&#8217;d! O heavens, what some men do,</line>
<line>While some men leave to do!</line>
<line>How some men creep in skittish Fortune&#8217;s hall,</line>
<line>Whiles others play the idiots in her eyes!</line>
<line>How one man eats into another&#8217;s pride,</line>
<line>While pride is fasting in his wantonness!</line>
<line>To see these Grecian lords!&#8212;why, even already</line>
<line>They clap the lubber Ajax on the shoulder,</line>
<line>As if his foot were on brave Hector&#8217;s breast,</line>
<line>And great Troy shrieking.</line>

<line>I do believe it, for they pass&#8217;d by me</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker long="Ulysses">ULYSS.</speaker>
<line>Time hath, my lord, a wallet at his back,</line>
<line>Wherein he puts alms for oblivion,</line>
<line>A great-siz&#8217;d monster of ingratitudes.</line>
<line>Those scraps are good deeds past, which are devour&#8217;d</line>
<line>As fast as they are made, forgot as soon</line>
<line>As done. Perseverance, dear my lord,</line>
<line>Keeps honor bright; to have done is to hang</line>
<line>Quite out of fashion, like a rusty mail</line>
<line>In monumental mock&#8217;ry. Take the instant way,</line>
<line>For honor travels in a strait so narrow,</line>
<line>Where one but goes abreast. Keep then the path,</line>
<line>For emulation hath a thousand sons</line>
<line>That one by one pursue. If you give way,</line>
<line>Or hedge aside from the direct forthright,</line>
<line>Like to an ent&#8217;red tide, they all rush by</line>
<line>And leave you hindmost;</line>
<line>Or like a gallant horse fall&#8217;n in first rank,</line>
<line>Lie there for pavement to the abject rear,</line>
<line>O&#8217;errun and trampled on. Then what they do in present,</line>
<line>Though less than yours in past, must o&#8217;ertop yours;</line>
<line>For Time is like a fashionable host</line>
<line>That slightly shakes his parting guest by th&#8217; hand,</line>
<line>And with his arms outstretch&#8217;d as he would fly,</line>
<line>Grasps in the comer. The welcome ever smiles,</line>
<line>And farewell goes out sighing. Let not virtue seek</line>
<line>Remuneration for the thing it was;</line>
<line>For beauty, wit,</line>
<line>High birth, vigor of bone, desert in service,</line>
<line>Love, friendship, charity, are subjects all</line>
<line>To envious and calumniating Time.</line>
<line>One touch of nature makes the whole world kin,</line>
<line>That all with one consent praise new-born gawds,</line>
<line>Though they are made and moulded of things past,</line>
<line>And give to dust, that is a little gilt,</line>
<line>More laud than gilt o&#8217;erdusted.</line>
<line>The present eye praises the present object.</line>
<line>Then marvel not, thou great and complete man,</line>
<line>That all the Greeks begin to worship Ajax;</line>
<line>Since things in motion sooner catch the eye</line>
<line>Than what stirs not. The cry went once on thee,</line>
<line>And still it might, and yet it may again,</line>
<line>If thou wouldst not entomb thyself alive</line>
<line>And case thy reputation in thy tent,</line>
<line>Whose glorious deeds but in these fields of late</line>

<line>Which hath an operation more divine</line>
<line>Than breath or pen can give expressure to.</line>
<line>All the commerce that you have had with Troy</line>
<line>As perfectly is ours as yours, my lord,</line>

<line>&#8220;Great Hector&#8217;s sister did Achilles win,</line>

<line>Why, &#8217;a stalks up and down like a peacock&#8212;a stride and a stand; ruminates like an hostess that hath no arithmetic but her brain to set down her reckoning; bites his lip with a politic regard, as who should say there were wit in this head and &#8217;twould out&#8212;and so there is; but it lies as coldly in him as fire in a flint, which will not show without knocking. 
The man&#8217;s undone forever, for if Hector break not his neck i&#8217; th&#8217; combat, he&#8217;ll break&#8217;t himself in vainglory. He knows not me. I said, &#8220;Good morrow, Ajax&#8221;; and he replies, &#8220;Thanks, Agamemnon.&#8221; 
What think you of this man that takes me for the general? He&#8217;s grown a very land-fish, languageless, a monster. A plague of opinion! A man may wear it on both sides, like a leather jerkin.</line>

<line>With too much blood and too little brain, these two may run mad, but, if with too much brain and too little blood they do, I&#8217;ll be a curer of madmen. Here&#8217;s Agamemnon, an honest fellow enough, and one that loves quails, but he has not so much brain as ear-wax; and the goodly transformation of Jupiter there, his brother, the bull, the primitive statue and oblique memorial of cuckolds, a thrifty shoeing-horn in a chain, hanging at his brother&#8217;s leg&#8212;to what form but that he is, should wit larded with malice, and malice fac&#8217;d with wit, turn him to? To an ass, were nothing, he is both ass and ox; to an ox, were nothing, he is both ox and ass. To be a dog, a moile, a cat, a fitchook, a toad, a lezard, an owl, a puttock, or a herring without a roe, I would not care; but to be Menelaus, I would conspire against destiny. Ask me not what I would be if I were not Thersites, for I care not to be the louse of a lazar, so I were not Menelaus. Hey-day! Sprites and fires!</line>
