<stanza num="1">
<line number="1" rhyme="a">From off a hill whose concave womb reworded</line>
<line number="2" rhyme="b">A plaintful story from a sist&#8217;ring vale,</line>
<line number="3" rhyme="a">My spirits t&#8217; attend this double voice accorded,</line>
<line number="4" rhyme="b">And down I laid to list the sad-tun&#8217;d tale,</line>
<line number="5" rhyme="b">Ere long espied a fickle maid full pale</line>
<line number="6" rhyme="c">Tearing of papers, breaking rings a-twain,</line>
<line number="7" rhyme="c">Storming her world with sorrow&#8217;s wind and rain.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza num="2">
<line number="8" rhyme="a">Upon her head a platted hive of straw,</line>
<line number="9" rhyme="b">Which fortified her visage from the sun,</line>
<line number="10" rhyme="a">Whereon the thought might think sometime it saw</line>
<line number="11" rhyme="b">The carcass of a beauty spent and done.</line>
<line number="12" rhyme="b">Time had not scythed all that youth begun,</line>
<line number="13" rhyme="c">Nor youth all quit, but spite of heaven&#8217;s fell rage,</line>
<line number="14" rhyme="c">Some beauty peep&#8217;d through lettice of sear&#8217;d age.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza num="3">
<line number="15" rhyme="a">Oft did she heave her napkin to her eyne,</line>
<line number="16" rhyme="b">Which on it had conceited characters,</line>
<line number="17" rhyme="a">Laund&#8217;ring the silken figures in the brine</line>
<line number="18" rhyme="b">That seasoned woe had pelleted in tears,</line>
<line number="19" rhyme="b">And often reading what contents it bears;</line>
<line number="20" rhyme="c">As often shriking undistinguish&#8217;d woe,</line>
<line number="21" rhyme="c">In clamors of all size, both high and low.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza num="4">
<line number="22" rhyme="a">Sometimes her levell&#8217;d eyes their carriage ride,</line>
<line number="23" rhyme="b">As they did batt&#8217;ry to the spheres intend;</line>
<line number="24" rhyme="a">Sometime diverted their poor balls are tied</line>
<line number="25" rhyme="b">To th&#8217; orbed earth; sometimes they do extend</line>
<line number="26" rhyme="b">Their view right on; anon their gazes lend</line>
<line number="27" rhyme="c">To every place at once, and no where fix&#8217;d,</line>
<line number="28" rhyme="c">The mind and sight distractedly commix&#8217;d.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza num="5">
<line number="29" rhyme="a">Her hair, nor loose nor tied in formal plat,</line>
<line number="30" rhyme="b">Proclaim&#8217;d in her a careless hand of pride;</line>
<line number="31" rhyme="a">For some untuck&#8217;d descended her sheav&#8217;d hat,</line>
<line number="32" rhyme="b">Hanging her pale and pined cheek beside;</line>
<line number="33" rhyme="b">Some in her threaden fillet still did bide,</line>
<line number="34" rhyme="c">And true to bondage would not break from thence,</line>
<line number="35" rhyme="c">Though slackly braided in loose negligence.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza num="6">
<line number="36" rhyme="a">A thousand favors from a maund she drew,</line>
<line number="37" rhyme="b">Of amber, crystal, and of beaded jet,</line>
<line number="38" rhyme="a">Which one by one she in a river threw,</line>
<line number="39" rhyme="b">Upon whose weeping margent she was set,</line>
<line number="40" rhyme="b">Like usury applying wet to wet,</line>
<line number="41" rhyme="c">Or monarch&#8217;s hands that lets not bounty fall</line>
<line number="42" rhyme="c">Where want cries some, but where excess begs all.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza num="7">
<line number="43" rhyme="a">Of folded schedules had she many a one,</line>
<line number="44" rhyme="b">Which she perus&#8217;d, sigh&#8217;d, tore, and gave the flood,</line>
<line number="45" rhyme="a">Crack&#8217;d many a ring of posied gold and bone,</line>
<line number="46" rhyme="b">Bidding them find their sepulchres in mud,</line>
<line number="47" rhyme="b">Found yet more letters sadly penn&#8217;d in blood,</line>
<line number="48" rhyme="c">With sleided silk feat and affectedly</line>
<line number="49" rhyme="c">Enswath&#8217;d and seal&#8217;d to curious secrecy.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza num="8">
<line number="50" rhyme="a">These often bath&#8217;d she in her fluxive eyes,</line>
<line number="51" rhyme="b">And often kiss&#8217;d, and often gan to tear;</line>
<line number="52" rhyme="a">Cried, &#8220;O false blood, thou register of lies,</line>
<line number="53" rhyme="b">What unapproved witness dost thou bear!</line>
<line number="54" rhyme="b">Ink would have seem&#8217;d more black and damned here!&#8221;</line>
<line number="55" rhyme="c">This said, in top of rage the lines she rents,</line>
<line number="56" rhyme="c">Big discontent so breaking their contents.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza num="9">
<line number="57" rhyme="a">A reverend man that graz&#8217;d his cattle nigh,</line>
<line number="58" rhyme="b">Sometime a blusterer that the ruffle knew</line>
<line number="59" rhyme="a">Of court, of city, and had let go by</line>
<line number="60" rhyme="b">The swiftest hours, observed as they flew,</line>
<line number="61" rhyme="b">Towards this afflicted fancy fastly drew,</line>
<line number="62" rhyme="c">And privileg&#8217;d by age desires to know</line>
<line number="63" rhyme="c">In brief the grounds and motives of her woe.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza num="10">
<line number="64" rhyme="a">So slides he down upon his grained bat,</line>
<line number="65" rhyme="b">And comely distant sits he by her side,</line>
<line number="66" rhyme="a">When he again desires her, being sat,</line>
<line number="67" rhyme="b">Her grievance with his hearing to divide:</line>
<line number="68" rhyme="b">If that from him there may be aught applied</line>
<line number="69" rhyme="c">Which may her suffering ecstasy assuage,</line>
<line number="70" rhyme="c">&#8217;Tis promis&#8217;d in the charity of age.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza num="11">
<line number="71" rhyme="a">&#8220;Father,&#8221; she says, &#8220;though in me you behold</line>
<line number="72" rhyme="b">The injury of many a blasting hour,</line>
<line number="73" rhyme="a">Let it not tell your judgment I am old,</line>
<line number="74" rhyme="b">Not age, but sorrow, over me hath power;</line>
<line number="75" rhyme="b">I might as yet have been a spreading flower,</line>
<line number="76" rhyme="c">Fresh to myself, if I had self-applied</line>
<line number="77" rhyme="c">Love to myself, and to no love beside.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza num="12">
<line number="78" rhyme="a">&#8220;But woe is me, too early I attended</line>
<line number="79" rhyme="b">A youthful suit&#8212;it was to gain my grace;</line>
<line number="80" rhyme="a">O, one by nature&#8217;s outwards so commended</line>
<line number="81" rhyme="b">That maidens&#8217; eyes stuck over all his face.</line>
<line number="82" rhyme="b">Love lack&#8217;d a dwelling and made him her place;</line>
<line number="83" rhyme="c">And when in his fair parts she did abide,</line>
<line number="84" rhyme="c">She was new lodg&#8217;d and newly deified.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza num="13">
<line number="85" rhyme="a">&#8220;His browny locks did hang in crooked curls,</line>
<line number="86" rhyme="b">And every light occasion of the wind</line>
<line number="87" rhyme="a">Upon his lips their silken parcels hurls.</line>
<line number="88" rhyme="b">What&#8217;s sweet to do, to do will aptly find:</line>
<line number="89" rhyme="b">Each eye that saw him did enchant the mind,</line>
<line number="90" rhyme="c">For on his visage was in little drawn</line>
<line number="91" rhyme="c">What largeness thinks in Paradise was sawn.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza num="14">
<line number="92" rhyme="a">&#8220;Small show of man was yet upon his chin,</line>
<line number="93" rhyme="b">His phoenix down began but to appear</line>
<line number="94" rhyme="a">Like unshorn velvet on that termless skin,</line>
<line number="95" rhyme="b">Whose bare outbragg&#8217;d the web it seem&#8217;d to wear;</line>
<line number="96" rhyme="b">Yet showed his visage by that cost more dear,</line>
<line number="97" rhyme="c">And nice affections wavering stood in doubt</line>
<line number="98" rhyme="c">If best were as it was, or best without.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza num="15">
<line number="99" rhyme="a">&#8220;His qualities were beauteous as his form,</line>
<line number="100" rhyme="b">For maiden-tongu&#8217;d he was, and thereof free;</line>
<line number="101" rhyme="a">Yet if men mov&#8217;d him, was he such a storm</line>
<line number="102" rhyme="b">As oft &#8217;twixt May and April is to see,</line>
<line number="103" rhyme="b">When winds breathe sweet, unruly though they be.</line>
<line number="104" rhyme="c">His rudeness so with his authoriz&#8217;d youth</line>
<line number="105" rhyme="c">Did livery falseness in a pride of truth.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza num="16">
<line number="106" rhyme="a">&#8220;Well could he ride, and often men would say,</line>
<line number="107" rhyme="b">&#8216;That horse his mettle from his rider takes;</line>
<line number="108" rhyme="a">Proud of subjection, noble by the sway,</line>
<line number="109" rhyme="b">What rounds, what bounds, what course, what stop he makes!&#8217;</line>
<line number="110" rhyme="b">And controversy hence a question takes,</line>
<line number="111" rhyme="c">Whether the horse by him became his deed,</line>
<line number="112" rhyme="c">Or he his manage by th&#8217; well-doing steed.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza num="17">
<line number="113" rhyme="a">&#8220;But quickly on this side the verdict went:</line>
<line number="114" rhyme="b">His real habitude gave life and grace</line>
<line number="115" rhyme="a">To appertainings and to ornament,</line>
<line number="116" rhyme="b">Accomplish&#8217;d in himself, not in his case;</line>
<line number="117" rhyme="b">All aids, themselves made fairer by their place,</line>
<line number="118" rhyme="c">Came for additions, yet their purpos&#8217;d trim</line>
<line number="119" rhyme="c">Piec&#8217;d not his grace but were all grac&#8217;d by him.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza num="18">
<line number="120" rhyme="a">&#8220;So on the tip of his subduing tongue</line>
<line number="121" rhyme="b">All kind of arguments and question deep,</line>
<line number="122" rhyme="a">All replication prompt and reason strong,</line>
<line number="123" rhyme="b">For his advantage still did wake and sleep.</line>
<line number="124" rhyme="b">To make the weeper laugh, the laugher weep,</line>
<line number="125" rhyme="c">He had the dialect and different skill,</line>
<line number="126" rhyme="c">Catching all passions in his craft of will,</line>
</stanza>

<stanza num="19">
<line number="127" rhyme="a">&#8220;That he did in the general bosom reign</line>
<line number="128" rhyme="b">Of young, of old, and sexes both enchanted,</line>
<line number="129" rhyme="a">To dwell with him in thoughts, or to remain</line>
<line number="130" rhyme="b">In personal duty, following where he haunted.</line>
<line number="131" rhyme="b">Consents bewitch&#8217;d, ere he desire, have granted,</line>
<line number="132" rhyme="c">And dialogu&#8217;d for him what he would say,</line>
<line number="133" rhyme="c">Ask&#8217;d their own wills and made their wills obey.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza num="20">
<line number="134" rhyme="a">&#8220;Many there were that did his picture get</line>
<line number="135" rhyme="b">To serve their eyes, and in it put their mind,</line>
<line number="136" rhyme="a">Like fools that in th&#8217; imagination set</line>
<line number="137" rhyme="b">The goodly objects which abroad they find</line>
<line number="138" rhyme="b">Of lands and mansions, theirs in thought assign&#8217;d,</line>
<line number="139" rhyme="c">And laboring in more pleasures to bestow them</line>
<line number="140" rhyme="c">Than the true gouty landlord which doth owe them.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza num="21">
<line number="141" rhyme="a">&#8220;So many have that never touch&#8217;d his hand</line>
<line number="142" rhyme="b">Sweetly suppos&#8217;d them mistress of his heart.</line>
<line number="143" rhyme="a">My woeful self that did in freedom stand,</line>
<line number="144" rhyme="b">And was my own fee-simple (not in part),</line>
<line number="145" rhyme="b">What with his art in youth and youth in art,</line>
<line number="146" rhyme="c">Threw my affections in his charmed power,</line>
<line number="147" rhyme="c">Reserv&#8217;d the stalk and gave him all my flower.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza num="22">
<line number="148" rhyme="a">&#8220;Yet did I not as some my equals did</line>
<line number="149" rhyme="b">Demand of him, nor being desired yielded;</line>
<line number="150" rhyme="a">Finding myself in honor so forbid,</line>
<line number="151" rhyme="b">With safest distance I mine honor shielded.</line>
<line number="152" rhyme="b">Experience for me many bulwarks builded</line>
<line number="153" rhyme="c">Of proofs new-bleeding which remain&#8217;d the foil</line>
<line number="154" rhyme="c">Of this false jewel, and his amorous spoil.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza num="23">
<line number="155" rhyme="a">&#8220;But ah, who ever shunn&#8217;d by precedent</line>
<line number="156" rhyme="b">The destin&#8217;d ill she must herself assay,</line>
<line number="157" rhyme="a">Or forc&#8217;d examples &#8217;gainst her own content</line>
<line number="158" rhyme="b">To put the by-past perils in her way?</line>
<line number="159" rhyme="b">Counsel may stop a while what will not stay;</line>

<line number="161" rhyme="c">By blunting us to make our wits more keen.</line>

<stanza num="24">

<stanza num="25">
<line number="169" rhyme="a">&#8220;For further I could say this man&#8217;s untrue,</line>

<line number="171" rhyme="a">Heard where his plants in others&#8217; orchards grew,</line>
<line number="172" rhyme="b">Saw how deceits were gilded in his smiling,</line>
<line number="173" rhyme="b">Knew vows were ever brokers to defiling,</line>

<subtitle>The Argument</subtitle>
<line type="argument">Lucius Tarquinius (for his excessive pride surnamed Superbus), after he had caused his own father-in-law Servius Tullius to be cruelly murd&#8217;red, and contrary to the Roman laws and customs, not requiring or staying for the people&#8217;s suffrages, had possessed himself of the kingdom, went, accompanied with his sons and other noblemen of Rome, to besiege Ardea; during which siege, the principal men of the army meeting one evening at the tent of Sextus Tarquinius, the King&#8217;s son, in their discourses after supper every one commended the virtues of his own wife; among whom Collatinus extolled the incomparable chastity of his wife Lucretia. In that pleasant humor they all posted to Rome, and intending by their secret and sudden arrival to make trial of that which every one had before avouched, only Collatinus finds his wife (though it were late in the night) spinning amongest her maids; the other ladies were all found dancing and revelling, or in several disports; whereupon the noblemen yielded Collatinus the victory, and his wife the fame. At that time Sextus Tarquinius being inflamed with Lucrece&#8217; beauty, yet smothering his passions for the present, departed with the rest back to the camp; from whence he shortly after privily withdrew himself, and was (according to his estate) royally entertained and lodged by Lucrece at Collatium. The same night he treacherously stealeth into her chamber, violently ravish&#8217;d her, and early in the morning speedeth away. Lucrece, in this lamentable plight, hastily dispatcheth messengers, one to Rome for her father, another to the camp for Collatine. They came, the one accompanied with Junius Brutus, the other with Publius Valerius; and finding Lucrece attired in mourning habit, demanded the cause of her sorrow. She, first taking an oath of them for her revenge, revealed the actor, and whole manner of his dealing, and withal suddenly stabbed herself. Which done, with one consent they all vowed to root out the whole hated family of the Tarquins; and bearing the dead body to Rome, Brutus acquainted the people with the doer and manner of the vile deed; with a bitter invective against the tyranny of the King, wherewith the people were so moved, that with one consent and a general acclamation the Tarquins were all exiled, and the state government changed from kings to consuls.</line>

<stanza num="1">
<line number="1" rhyme="a">From the besieged Ardea all in post,</line>
<line number="2" rhyme="b">Borne by the trustless wings of false desire,</line>
<line number="3" rhyme="a">Lust-breathed Tarquin leaves the Roman host,</line>
<line number="4" rhyme="b">And to Collatium bears the lightless fire,</line>
<line number="5" rhyme="b">Which in pale embers hid, lurks to aspire,</line>
<couplet>
<line number="6" rhyme="c">And girdle with embracing flames the waist</line>
<line number="7" rhyme="c">Of Collatine&#8217;s fair love, Lucrece the chaste.</line>
</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza num="2">
<line number="8" rhyme="a">Happ&#8217;ly that name of &#8220;chaste&#8221; unhapp&#8217;ly set</line>
<line number="9" rhyme="b">This bateless edge on his keen appetite;</line>
<line number="10" rhyme="a">When Collatine unwisely did not let</line>
<line number="11" rhyme="b">To praise the clear unmatched red and white</line>
<line number="12" rhyme="b">Which triumph&#8217;d in that sky of his delight;</line>
<couplet>
<line number="13" rhyme="c">Where mortal stars as bright as heaven&#8217;s beauties,</line>
<line number="14" rhyme="c">With pure aspects did him peculiar duties.</line>
</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza num="3">
<line number="15" rhyme="a">For he the night before, in Tarquin&#8217;s tent,</line>
<line number="16" rhyme="b">Unlock&#8217;d the treasure of his happy state;</line>
<line number="17" rhyme="a">What priceless wealth the heavens had him lent</line>
<line number="18" rhyme="b">In the possession of his beauteous mate;</line>
<line number="19" rhyme="b">Reck&#8217;ning his fortune at such high proud rate</line>
<couplet>
<line number="20" rhyme="c">That kings might be espoused to more fame,</line>
<line number="21" rhyme="c">But king nor peer to such a peerless dame.</line>
</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza num="4">
<line number="22" rhyme="a">O happiness enjoy&#8217;d but of a few,</line>
<line number="23" rhyme="b">And if possess&#8217;d, as soon decay&#8217;d and done</line>
<line number="24" rhyme="a">As is the morning&#8217;s silver melting dew</line>
<line number="25" rhyme="b">Against the golden splendor of the sun!</line>
<line number="26" rhyme="b">An expir&#8217;d date, cancell&#8217;d ere well begun.</line>

<line number="27" rhyme="c">Honor and beauty, in the owner&#8217;s arms,</line>

</stanza>

<stanza num="5">
<line number="29" rhyme="a">Beauty itself doth of itself persuade</line>

<line number="31" rhyme="a">What needeth then apology be made</line>
<line number="32" rhyme="b">To set forth that which is so singular?</line>
<line number="33" rhyme="b">Or why is Collatine the publisher</line>

</stanza>

<stanza num="6">
<line number="36" rhyme="a">Perchance his boast of Lucrece&#8217; sov&#8217;reignty</line>
<line number="37" rhyme="b">Suggested this proud issue of a king;</line>

<line number="39" rhyme="b">Perchance that envy of so rich a thing,</line>
<line number="40" rhyme="b">Braving compare, disdainfully did sting</line>
<couplet>
<line number="41" rhyme="c">His high-pitch&#8217;d thoughts, that meaner men should vaunt</line>
<line number="42" rhyme="c">That golden hap which their superiors want.</line>
</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza num="7">
<line number="43" rhyme="a">But some untimely thought did instigate</line>
<line number="44" rhyme="b">His all too timeless speed, if none of those.</line>
<line number="45" rhyme="a">His honor, his affairs, his friends, his state,</line>
<line number="46" rhyme="b">Neglected all, with swift intent he goes</line>
<line number="47" rhyme="b">To quench the coal which in his liver glows.</line>
<couplet>
<line number="48" rhyme="c">O rash false heat, wrapp&#8217;d in repentant cold,</line>
<line number="49" rhyme="c">Thy hasty spring still blasts and ne&#8217;er grows old!</line>
</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza num="8">
<line number="50" rhyme="a">When at Collatium this false lord arrived,</line>

<line number="53" rhyme="b">Which of them both should underprop her fame.</line>
<line number="54" rhyme="b">When virtue bragg&#8217;d, beauty would blush for shame;</line>
<couplet>
<line number="55" rhyme="c">When beauty boasted blushes, in despite</line>
<line number="56" rhyme="c">Virtue would stain that o&#8217;er with silver white.</line>
</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza num="9">
<line number="57" rhyme="a">But beauty, in that white entituled</line>
<line number="58" rhyme="b">From Venus&#8217; doves, doth challenge that fair field;</line>
<line number="59" rhyme="a">Then virtue claims from beauty beauty&#8217;s red,</line>
<line number="60" rhyme="b">Which virtue gave the golden age to gild</line>
<line number="61" rhyme="b">Their silver cheeks, and call&#8217;d it then their shield,</line>
<couplet>
<line number="62" rhyme="c">Teaching them thus to use it in the fight,</line>
<line number="63" rhyme="c">When shame assail&#8217;d, the red should fence the white.</line>
</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza num="10">
<line number="64" rhyme="a">This heraldry in Lucrece&#8217; face was seen,</line>

<line number="67" rhyme="b">Proving from world&#8217;s minority their right;</line>
<line number="68" rhyme="b">Yet their ambition makes them still to fight,</line>

</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza num="11">
<line number="71" rhyme="a">This silent war of lilies and of roses,</line>

<line number="74" rhyme="b">Where lest between them both it should be kill&#8217;d,</line>
<line number="75" rhyme="b">The coward captive vanquished doth yield</line>
<couplet>
<line number="76" rhyme="c">To those two armies that would let him go,</line>
<line number="77" rhyme="c">Rather than triumph in so false a foe.</line>
</couplet>
</stanza>

<stanza num="12">
<line number="78" rhyme="a">Now thinks he that her husband&#8217;s shallow tongue,</line>

<line number="80" rhyme="a">In that high task hath done her beauty wrong,</line>

<line number="82" rhyme="b">Therefore that praise which Collatine doth owe,</line>
<couplet>
<line number="83" rhyme="c">Enchanted Tarquin answers with surmise,</line>
<line number="84" rhyme="c">In silent wonder of still-gazing eyes.</line>

<stanza num="13">
<line number="85" rhyme="a">This earthly saint, adored by this devil,</line>

But if the first heire of my inuention proue deformed, I shall be sorie it had so noble a god-father: and neuer after eare so barren a land, for feare it yeeld me still so bad a haruest, I leaue it to your Honourable suruey, and your Honor to your hearts content, which I wish may alwaies answere your owne wish, and the worlds hopefull expectation.</line>
<line>Your Honors in all dutie,</line>
