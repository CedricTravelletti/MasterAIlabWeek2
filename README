High-quality XML versions of the complete works of Shakespeare

A number of conventions were used in the creation of the Complete Works XML:

1. Acts are wrapped in <act> which includes the act title <acttitle>. All acts are wrapped in <PLAY>.

2. Scenes are wrapped in <scene>, which includes the scene title <scenetitle>, scene location <scenelocation>, and the scene personae <scenepersonae>. Scenes are always wrapped within <act>.

3. Character speeches are wrapped in <speech>, which includes the speaker's name <speaker> (the short version) and the lines <line> spoken.

4. Stage directions are identified with <stagedir>. Sometimes they stand on their own within a scene and sometimes they are within a character's <speech> depending on when the action occurs.

5. The entire play is wrapped in <play> which include the full title <title>, the short version of the title <titleshort>, and the playwright <playwright>.

6. Offsets were used to identify where short lines are shared lines: <line offset="X">, where X is the number of syllables spoken before that line begins.

7. When a character is singing or incanting, the line is identified with <line type="lyric">.

8. When a character is reading or reciting, the passage is identified with <recite>

9, Foreign language words are wrapped in their respective language tags: <latin xml:lang="la">, <french xml:lang="fr">, <italian xml:lang="it">, <dutch xml:lang="nl">

10. Where formal titles of works (play names, song titles) are mentioned, they are wrapped in <titleref> or <nameref>.

11. Sometimes characters change names over the course of a play. When that happens, there's an alias in that character's lines indicating their former character: <speaker alias="L. GREY.">Q. ELIZ.</speaker>.

12. Where multiple characters are speaking at once, the same speaker alias is used or the characters are identified in the <speaker> tag.

13. Stage directions are identified by type: exit, entrance, aside, song, action, death, fight. They are also identified by the person(s) performing them or the recipient of the action using the short version of their name ( <dir type="speak">To Helena.</dir><actor>BER.</actor><recipient>HEL.</recipient> ). All "exit" attributes indicate the character exiting. All "exeunt" tags indicate all characters exit unless a character name is within the <actor> tags. Any <actor> tag with "ALL." in it indicate all characters currently present in a scene perform that action.

14. Lines are identified as prose, verse or rhyming verse (verse, rhyme, prose) in the form of <line form="verse">. 

15. The license and author information is at the bottom of each play and wrapped in <sourcedetails>. This information may be hidden using XSL/CSS, but may not be removed.
