    <PERSONA>
      <NAME short="">Joan de Pucelle</NAME>
      <DESCRIPTION>Joan de Pucelle is history&#8217;s Joan of Arc, though she is no saint in this play. An plain-spoken woman with no doubts whatsoever, she breezes through all difficulties, seeing at once that Reignier is not the Dolphin, convincing the French to follow her, vanquishing the English, talking her way out of blame, vanquishing again, and convincing the Duke of Burgundy to join the French cause. She is an excellent fighter, better at swordplay than Charles is. Other than all-out assault, she is also adept at tricking her way into advantageous situations and capturing cities that way. Though she claims to be a maid and helped by the Virgin Mary, it turns out that she actually talks with demons, and probably sleeps with the entirety of the French leadership. She has a sharp tongue, mocking the English well, and swearing with great effect when she is captured. She grows more and more full of herself as time goes on, and in the end refuses to recognize her father, insisting that she is in fact nobly born. Desperate to avoid death, she swears that she is a virgin and then that she is pregnant, but cannot decide on an identity for the father. She is burned alive at the stake.</DESCRIPTION>
    </PERSONA>
    <PERSONA>
      <NAME short="">Countess of Auvergne</NAME>
      <DESCRIPTION>Countess of Auvergne is a patriotic Frenchwoman who thinks she will be able to deal a terrible blow to the English by capturing Talbot, and not incidentally become very famous. Unfortunately for her, he sees through her trick before he even meets her. She is bemused to find him a physically unimpressive man, and quite seduced by him once he tricks her &#8212; unless, of course, she is merely flattering out of fear for her life.</DESCRIPTION>
    </PERSONA>
    <PERSONA>
      <NAME short="">Margaret</NAME>
      <DESCRIPTION>Margaret is Reignier of Anjou&#8217;s daughter, and sets stock by his empty claim to be a King. Captured by Suffolk, she is oblivious to the fact that he falls in love with her on sight, though she feels more than a twinge in the same direction herself. She attempts to immediately get down to business with him and to work out a ransom, and becomes impatient with his lack of attention to her. She is proud, though not unaware of the poverty of her position. She agrees to marry King Henry, though with no great passion. Where this leads may be discovered in <NAMEREF>Henry VI, Part Two</NAMEREF>.</DESCRIPTION>

      <DESCRIPTION>Master Gunner is in charge of the French artillery at Orl&amp;eacute;ans. He wishes to accomplish a great act that will bring him to the attention of the French leadership, and for that purpose has aimed a gun at a point where the English noblemen will come to look at the town. After three days of waiting for them, he is exhausted and sets his son to watch instead, which as far as his hopes of gaining recognition go is a mistake.</DESCRIPTION>

    <PERSONA>
      <NAME short="">Reignier, Duke of Anjou</NAME>
      <DESCRIPTION>Reignier, Duke of Anjou is an impoverished French nobleman who holds the purely cosmetic title of King of Naples. One of Charles&#8217;s main generals, he is as willing as his master to let Joan de Pucelle save their skins. When his daughter Margaret is captured by Suffolk, he is at first worried, but when the Englishman asks to have her married to King Henry, Reignier is quick to agree so long as the English stop attacking him. He is vainglorious and not particularly intelligent, though he does counsel Charles to take the peace treaty that makes him King and ends the war.</DESCRIPTION>

He is himself a bit of a coward, reneging on his word not to run away until he sees that he actually is in danger of death. He does not like taking responsibility and is quick to blame others. He is happily hypocritical when need be, swearing to a peace treaty he has no intention of keeping, and is a bit of a lightweight. Historically he is the same as the Dauphin of <NAMEREF>Henry V</NAMEREF>.</DESCRIPTION>

When brawling breaks out yet again, he has no option but to beg the King for help. He is an ordinary civilian, more concerned with commerce than with the in-fighting of the nobility or the war in France.</DESCRIPTION>

      <NAME short="">Sir Thomas Gargrave</NAME>
      <DESCRIPTION>Sir Thomas Gargrave is an English knight who is part of the force besieging Orl&amp;eacute;ans and is an expert on artillery placement, though he disagrees with the other expert, Glansdale.

    <PERSONA>
      <NAME short="">Sir John Falstaff</NAME>

He was part of a rebellion against the latter which failed, after which he was sent to jail (see <NAMEREF>Henry IV, Part One</NAMEREF>). Knowing himself to be dying, he calls his nephew Richard Plantagenet to his side to tell him of all this and let the young man know that he has more right to the throne than does the current King.

He is a courageous fighter, and bests Charles the Dolphin in combat, but his temper gets the best of him and he plunges into the fiercest part of the battle, where he is killed.</DESCRIPTION>
    </PERSONA>
    <PERSONA>
      <NAME short="">Lord Talbot</NAME>
      <DESCRIPTION>Lord Talbot, the Earl of Shrewsbury, is the greatest of the English generals in France, a man whose successes are so great that the mention of his name alone is enough to make the French run away. Though not a physically impressive man, he has great presence and commands intense loyalty from his men. He is a larger-than-life character, raging, proud, and with a great sense of humor and mockery. He is aware of how much he owes to his men, and regards them highly. He is distraught at being bested by Joan. He is not taken in by the Countess of Auvergne, suspecting a trap as soon as he receives her invitation. He is the ideal of English knighthood and knows it; he stands up for it and enforces its standards on those around him, punishing Falstaff for failing them. He loves his son and tries to make him leave their final battle, but fails. He holds as long as he can before falling in battle.</DESCRIPTION>
    </PERSONA>
    <PERSONA>
      <NAME short="">Earl of Suffolk</NAME>
      <DESCRIPTION>The Earl of Suffolk (William de la Pole), of the Lancastrian party, is a young English nobleman, a friend of Somerset&#8217;s.

      <NAME short="">Earl of Warwick</NAME>
      <DESCRIPTION>Earl of Warwick, of the Yorkist party, is a young English lord, a friend of Richard Plantagenet&#8217;s. Asked to mediate in the quarrel between Richard and the Duke of Somerset, he takes Richard&#8217;s side; he also presents the petition to the King that restores Richard to his inheritance. He acts as a restraint on Richard&#8217;s more violent instincts, holding him back from saying anything unforgivable. His further adventures are chronicled in <NAMEREF>Henry VI, Part Two</NAMEREF>.</DESCRIPTION>
    </PERSONA>
    <PERSONA>
      <NAME short="">Richard Plantagenet</NAME>
      <DESCRIPTION>Richard Plantagenet, head of the Yorkist party, is the son of the Earl of Cambridge, who attempted to assassinate the King&#8217;s father (see <NAMEREF>Henry V</NAMEREF>). His father&#8217;s action left Richard deprived of all his wealth and titles until these are officially returned to him by the King, making him Duke of York. Richard feels the shame of this deeply, and is very touchy on the subject; his quarrel with Somerset on the matter leads to a breach that will turn into the War of the Roses. He is convinced that he has a better right to the throne than Henry VI does, and in law he does, as he is descended from an elder branch of the royal family. Named to a combined command of the army in France with Somerset, he lets his quarrel with the latter overbear the good of the country, and refuses to send aid to the beleaguered Talbot, thus causing the hero&#8217;s death; he refuses to accept any responsibility for this. He has the luck to capture Joan de Pucelle, and has her burnt alive, mocking her brutally beforehand. Richard can be pitiless, and is enraged when he hears of peace behind declared between England and France. He is ambitios and does not always manage to disguise this fact. His further adventures are chronicled in <NAMEREF>Henry VI, Part Two</NAMEREF>.</DESCRIPTION>
    </PERSONA>
    <PERSONA>
      <NAME short="">John Beauford, Duke of Somerset</NAME>
      <DESCRIPTION>The Duke of Somerset, of the Lancastrian party, is a young and haughty lord, who despises Richard Plantagenet for being the son of a traitor, and is incensed when the latter is restored to his father&#8217;s lands and named Duke of York. His quarrel with Richard on this matter leads to a breach that will become the War of the Roses; he does not hold to his word to give in if more people side against him than with him. Named to an equal command with the new Duke of York in France, he refuses to collaborate with him, thereby leaving Talbot without help and causing his death. He refuses to accept any blame for Talbot&#8217;s demise. He cares only for his own good, nothing for the kingdom. He returns in <NAMEREF>Henry VI, Part Two</NAMEREF>.</DESCRIPTION>
    </PERSONA>
    <PERSONA>
      <NAME short="">Henry Beauford, Bishop of Winchester</NAME>
      <DESCRIPTION>The Bishop of Winchester is the bastard son of the King&#8217;s great-grandfather. He is a crafty, hypocritical, sly man of high ambitions, who has a permanent feud with the Duke of Gloucester. He pretends to be highly pious but in fact acts only for his own material gain, and to become the most powerful man in the kingdom he plans to abduct the King from Gloucester&#8217;s care. Failing, he swears to be friends with the Duke, but doesn&#8217;t mean it. He bribes the Pope into naming him a cardinal, which gives him equal rank with Dukes, and is sent by the King to treat for peace with the French. He returns in <NAMEREF>Henry VI, Part Two</NAMEREF>.</DESCRIPTION>

    <PERSONA>
      <NAME short="">Thomas Beauford, Duke of Exeter</NAME>

A fierce and warlike man, he is charged with the young King&#8217;s personal safety. He sees all too clearly what the quarrels between the various English aristocrats portend, and does not wish to live to see himself proved right. He is a member of the old guard, devoted to the memory of Henry V.</DESCRIPTION>

    <PERSONA>
      <NAME short="">Duke of Bedford</NAME>
      <DESCRIPTION>Duke of Bedford is Regent of France, in charge of continuing the war against the French and safeguarding Henry V&#8217;s conquests. An older man, he is impatient with the quarreling of the other English lords, being more concerned with the war than with their squabbling. He has a hard time believing that a woman could have any military ability. He falls ill as the fortune of battle shifts and shifts again, but forces himself to stay alive long enough to witness Roan being re-taken from the French.</DESCRIPTION>

    <PERSONA>
      <NAME short="">Duke of Gloucester</NAME>
      <DESCRIPTION>Duke of Gloucester is King Henry&#8217;s uncle and Lord Protector, charged with the safety of the King in his youth and the government of the realm until he comes of age. Historically he is the same as the Gloucester of Henry V. He has an all-abiding hatred of the Bishop of Winchester and carries on an endless feud with him, no matter how much it may harm the kingdom. Due to this hatred, he has little regard for the Church. The King is greatly dependent on him, a fact that Gloucester is used to; he is appalled when the King disregards his advice on the matter of his marriage. He is willing to be convinced to calm down his quarreling with the Bishop, but still loses his temper every time he is in the prelate&#8217;s presence. Though loyal, he is more concerned with himself and his ward than for the realm itself. He returns in <NAMEREF>Henry VI, Part Two</NAMEREF>.</DESCRIPTION>
    </PERSONA>
    <PERSONA>
      <NAME short="">King Henry the Sixth</NAME>
      <DESCRIPTION>King Henry VI is a very young, rather simple-minded monarch, of excessive piety and naivet&amp;eacute;, who relies almost entirely on his uncle the Duke of Gloucester. Becoming King while still a child, he is wide-eyed at the scuffles between his uncles, and cannot command as a King should; rather he begs, and occasionally cries. His greatest desire is for peace among his noblemen, though he believes entirely in his right to the French throne. He has absolutely no political sense, and agrees to Suffolk&#8217;s proposal that he should marry Margaret without considering any of the arguments against the match. He is generally a passive character, reacting to events rather than causing them. He returns in <NAMEREF>Henry VI, Part Two</NAMEREF>.</DESCRIPTION>
