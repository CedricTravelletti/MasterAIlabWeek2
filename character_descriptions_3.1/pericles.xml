    <PERSONA>
      <NAME short="">Gower</NAME>
      <DESCRIPTION>Gower is the English poet John Gower, whose work Confessio Amantis provided part of the plot of the play. Speaking in an old verse-form that signifies authority, he guides the audience through the play, most likely reading at times from a book. He sums up matters that would take too much time to show and offers the morals that should be taken away.</DESCRIPTION>
    </PERSONA>
    <PERSONA>
      <NAME short="">Antiochus</NAME>
      <DESCRIPTION>Antiochus is the King of Antioch. He is an evil man who sleeps with his daughter and wants to keep her all to himself. As such he devises a riddle that any man wishing to marry her must solve; when they do not, he gets to cut off their heads. He is one of the most powerful men of the region, but does not go to war when poisoning an enemy will serve just as well. His realization that Pericles has guessed his secret sets the prince off on his wanderings. He dies when he is hit with a bolt of lightning.</DESCRIPTION>
    </PERSONA>
    <PERSONA>
      <NAME short="">Pericles</NAME>
      <DESCRIPTION>Pericles is the Prince and King of Tyre. A passive man who mostly reacts to events rather than causing them, he leads a rather doom-laden life, each blow leading him a little lower until he sinks into catatonic depression. He can be subject to dark moods in which he is dangerous, and his councilors know it. He is a good fighter and a physically brave man, willing to risk death in the hopes of achieving the hand of Antiochus&#8217;s daughter, but when he solves the riddle and realizes that Antiochus is aware that he has, he flees. Conscious of the danger to his realm from Antiochus if he stays there, he takes to the seas to visit Tarsus, though in the long run this will endanger his throne. Though a decent, honest man, he does not appear to be the most communicative of monarchs, often forgetting to let his councilors know that he&#8217;s still alive when he&#8217;s travelling. Shipwrecked in Pentapolis, he hides his identity as King until Antiochus is dead. He is deeply in love with his wife Thaisa, and mourns her death deeply. Having almost lost his throne when spending too far away without giving news of himself after his first shipwreck, after the second he spends the next fourteen years in Tyre. He leaves his daughter Marina with some friends on the other side of the sea, swearing not to cut his hair until she is married. He is distraught at the news of her death, fourteen years later, at which point he is very hairy indeed. This final blow leaves him almost comatose with depression, unspeaking and unresponsive, until he is brought back to life by the singing and talk of a young lady who turns out to be his not-dead daughter. At this point he hears the music of the spheres, and Diana the goddess of chastity appears to him in a vision. Obedient to her, he recounts his story at her temple at Ephesus, where he is reunited with his also-living wife, at which stage it would seem that his troubles are at an end. Though he apostrophizes the heavens, he never blames them, only begging for mercy. The list of his misfortunes &#8212; in danger of assassination, shipwrecked, almost shipwrecked again, wife dead in childbirth, daughter dead &#8212; lead one to wonder what exactly he&#8217;s done to deserve them; the answer is nothing. He is a very average sort of monarch, something of an Everyman to whom bad things happen.</DESCRIPTION>
    </PERSONA>
    <PERSONA>
      <NAME short="">Helicanus</NAME>
      <DESCRIPTION>Helicanus is a counselor of Pericles&#8217;s, one who refuses to flatter him even when he is in a dangerous mood. Pericles trusts him enough to reveal to him why he has fled Antioch. He advises Pericles to travel to evade Antiochus&#8217;s assassins, and is named governor of Tyre during its lord&#8217;s absence. He is a deeply loyal man, who is shocked when some lords suggest that he take the crown, though he agrees that the lack of news from Pericles is troubling, and that if too much time passes, for the good of the country he will take the throne. He is relieved when Pericles returns. When the latter learns of his daughter&#8217;s death and sinks into depression, Helicanus follows him on his ship, for three months unsuccessfully attempting to get a response out of him. He is known as a wise man.</DESCRIPTION>

      <NAME short="">Simonides</NAME>
      <DESCRIPTION>King Simonides of Pentapolis is a monarch with a taste for show and practical jokes. He is beloved by his subjects as well as by his daughter Thaisa. He organizes a huge tournament as a birthday present for her. He wishes to absolutely certain that Thaisa and Pericles are genuinely in love with each other before he allows them to wed, and so pretends to be a jealous father to test them. He is erudite, and a benevolent man, the antithesis of Antiochus.</DESCRIPTION>
    </PERSONA>
    <PERSONA>
      <NAME short="">Cleon</NAME>
      <DESCRIPTION>Cleon is the Governor of Tarsus. A weak and passive man who tends to let things happen, and is under his wife Dionyza&#8217;s thumb. He accepts to look after Pericles&#8217;s daughter when the latter leaves Marina with him, but however horrified he is fourteen years later when Dionyza has the girl killed, he does nothing other than expostulate a little. When Marina turns out to be alive and it becomes known what has happened, his people rise against him and burn him alive with his wife in his palace.</DESCRIPTION>
    </PERSONA>
    <PERSONA>
      <NAME short="">Lysimachus</NAME>
      <DESCRIPTION>Lysimachus is the Governor of Mytilene, and not unknown to the brothels, though he is cautious and insists that the prostitutes he takes are disease-free. He is kind to the women he pays for there, and affected enough to not want to admit to what the trade they ply is. Like all the other men exposed to Marina, he is quickly converted from his lecherous ways and is very generous to her for it. He is intrigued when a ship decked in mourning approached his port and goes out to meet it. His opinion of Marina is by this time high enough that he agrees she may be able to cure the catatonic Pericles. Apparently he never tells Pericles that he first met Marina in a brothel, as he is able to convince the Prince of Tyre to let him marry his daughter.</DESCRIPTION>
    </PERSONA>

He has very few doubts about his own skill.</DESCRIPTION>

    <PERSONA>
      <NAME short="">Thaliard</NAME>
      <DESCRIPTION>Thaliard is a lord of Antioch who is ordered by Antiochus to poison Pericles, on pain of his own execution. He follows Pericles to Tyre. He is not particularly pleased at his mission, and seems happy that Pericles has gone to sea and that he will therefore not be faced with the necessity of killing him immediately.</DESCRIPTION>

He once parted two people fighting, and was hurt in the process. He is not however brave enough to face up to a brace of pirates. Before returning to claim that she is dead, he makes sure that the pirates do indeed carry her off rather than simply raping her and leaving her be.</DESCRIPTION>

      <NAME short="">Pander</NAME>
      <DESCRIPTION>Pander is a pimp running a brothel in Mytilene. He sends Boult to buy new women at the market, as those he already has are all rotted with venereal diseases. He lets his wife the Bawd take care of the prostitutes, while he looks after the money. He is unsentimental and makes no pretences about his job. Purchasing Marina for the high price he can get for selling her virginity, he is soon driven to distraction by how she instead turns all of his best and richest clients into virtuous men.</DESCRIPTION>

      <NAME short="">Boult</NAME>
      <DESCRIPTION>Boult is the doorkeeper at the brothel, and the third-in-command. Among his tasks are procuring new women at the slave market and advertising the new arrivals, and one of the perks of the job is his right to have a free go at the ladies on occasion. He is very taken with Marina and receives permission to sleep with her once she has been deprived of her virginity by a paying client. As she begins to convert the clients from whoring, he becomes convinced that there&#8217;s nothing for it but for him to take that task upon himself. Possessing the Pander and Bawd&#8217;s confidence, he is nevertheless bribable, and on being paid by Marina is able to convince them to follow the girl&#8217;s plan to be hired out as a teacher and singer. A bit of a crawler, he begs clients for tips as they leave, and knows them all. He is a realistic man, considering that the low morality of his job is still better than being mutilated in a war.</DESCRIPTION>

      <DESCRIPTION>Dionyza is Cleon&#8217;s wife. Though she swears to Pericles to bring up Marina with as much care as her own daughter Philoten, she soon grows envious of Marina for being just a bit better at everything than Philoten. This envy grows until she decides to have Marina murdered. She is excellent at acting kind to the girl in the meantime, however. Brusque and unsentimental, she has her husband completely under her thumb, and considers him a weakling. When Marina turns out to be alive and it becomes known what has happened, his people rise against Cleon and herself and burn them alive in their palace.</DESCRIPTION>
    </PERSONA>
    <PERSONA>
      <NAME short="">Thaisa</NAME>
      <DESCRIPTION>Thaisa is Simonides&#8217;s daughter. A beautiful girl, she is courted by princes from all over the world, but falls completely in love with the seemingly humble knight Pericles, who wins her birthday tournament. Insisting to her father that she will marry no-one else, no matter the cost, she passes his testing of her with flying colors. Though educated enough to read, she shows no great signs of intelligence. Appearing to die in childbirth, she is thrown overboard, only to be revived by Cerimon when he finds her. She then decides become a nun, for some reason never trying to find out if her husband is still alive. She is overjoyed to find him still living fourteen years later, and to meet her daughter Marina. She has a beautiful voice, good posture, and straight eyebrows.</DESCRIPTION>
    </PERSONA>
    <PERSONA>
      <NAME short="">Marina</NAME>
      <DESCRIPTION>Marina is Pericles and Thaisa&#8217;s daughter, born at sea in the middle of a storm. With her father mourning the death of his wife, she is left with his friends Cleon and Dionyza, who promise to bring her up along with their daughter Philoten. Trained in all the maidenly arts, she is an excellent weaver, embroiderer, musician, singer, dancer, little realizing that her superiority to Philoten in these matters enrages Dinoyza. A very innocent fourteen-year-old, she mourns the death of her nurse Lychorida deeply, and is stunned to discover that Leonine has been ordered to murder her. Captured by pirates and sold to a brothel, her almost pathological chastity makes her less of a bargain that the owners expected. Simply by talking, she is able to convince all the clients who want to pay for her to stop whoring. By bribing Boult, she gets him both to not rape her and to propose to the Bawd and Pander that she be hired out as a teacher rather than as a whore. Her fame growing, she is called upon to attempt to reach the catatonic man on a newly-arrived ship, who turns out to be her father. She looks very much like her mother, as well as having her voice, eyes, and straight-backed posture. Beautiful, obedient, accomplished, and chaste, she is every father&#8217;s ideal daughter. She marries Lysimachus, who first met her in the brothel.</DESCRIPTION>

    <PERSONA>
      <NAME short="">Bawd</NAME>

If one of the prostitutes has a child, she brings it up until it&#8217;s of an age to join the trade. She is impressed by Marina&#8217;s possibilities, though she thinks her an impossible goody-two-shoes. An excellent businesswoman, she has a good sense of marketing as well as connections, particularly her trading with the governor, Lysimachus. Marina&#8217;s converting the latter is the last straw for her, and she orders Boult to rape the girl and get things over with. She finally agrees to hire out Marina as a teacher and singer rather than as a prostitute, and that way finally begins to make some profit on her investment.</DESCRIPTION>
