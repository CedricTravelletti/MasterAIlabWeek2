<stagedir>Enter Richard Duke of Gloucester solus.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>Now is the winter of our discontent</line>
<line>Made glorious summer by this son of York;</line>
<line>And all the clouds that low&#8217;r&#8217;d upon our house</line>
<line>In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.</line>
<line>Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths,</line>
<line>Our bruised arms hung up for monuments,</line>
<line>Our stern alarums chang&#8217;d to merry meetings,</line>
<line>Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.</line>
<line>Grim-visag&#8217;d War hath smooth&#8217;d his wrinkled front;</line>
<line>And now, in stead of mounting barbed steeds</line>
<line>To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,</line>
<line>He capers nimbly in a lady&#8217;s chamber</line>
<line>To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.</line>
<line>But I, that am not shap&#8217;d for sportive tricks,</line>
<line>Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;</line>
<line>I, that am rudely stamp&#8217;d, and want love&#8217;s majesty</line>
<line>To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;</line>
<line>I, that am curtail&#8217;d of this fair proportion,</line>
<line>Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,</line>
<line>Deform&#8217;d, unfinish&#8217;d, sent before my time</line>
<line>Into this breathing world, scarce half made up,</line>
<line>And that so lamely and unfashionable</line>
<line>That dogs bark at me as I halt by them&#8212;</line>
<line>Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,</line>
<line>Have no delight to pass away the time,</line>
<line>Unless to see my shadow in the sun</line>
<line>And descant on mine own deformity.</line>
<line>And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover</line>
<line>To entertain these fair well-spoken days,</line>
<line>I am determined to prove a villain</line>
<line>And hate the idle pleasures of these days.</line>
<line>Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,</line>
<line>By drunken prophecies, libels, and dreams,</line>
<line>To set my brother Clarence and the King</line>
<line>In deadly hate the one against the other;</line>
<line>And if King Edward be as true and just</line>
<line>As I am subtle, false, and treacherous,</line>
<line>This day should Clarence closely be mew&#8217;d up</line>
<line>About a prophecy, which says that G</line>
<line>Of Edward&#8217;s heirs the murderer shall be.</line>
<line>Dive, thoughts, down to my soul, here Clarence comes!</line>

<stagedir>Enter Clarence, guarded, and Brakenbury, Lieutenant of the Tower.</stagedir>
<line>Brother, good day. What means this armed guard</line>
<line>That waits upon your Grace?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CLAR.</speaker>
<line offset="6">His Majesty,</line>
<line>Tend&#8217;ring my person&#8217;s safety, hath appointed</line>
<line>This conduct to convey me to the Tower.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>Upon what cause?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CLAR.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Because my name is George.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>Alack, my lord, that fault is none of yours;</line>
<line>He should for that commit your godfathers.</line>
<line>O, belike his Majesty hath some intent</line>
<line>That you should be new christ&#8217;ned in the Tower.</line>
<line>But what&#8217;s the matter, Clarence, may I know?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CLAR.</speaker>
<line>Yea, Richard, when I know; but I protest</line>
<line>As yet I do not. But, as I can learn,</line>
<line>He hearkens after prophecies and dreams,</line>
<line>And from the cross-row plucks the letter G,</line>
<line>And says a wizard told him that by G</line>
<line>His issue disinherited should be;</line>
<line>And for my name of George begins with G,</line>
<line>It follows in his thought that I am he.</line>
<line>These (as I learn) and such-like toys as these</line>
<line>Hath mov&#8217;d his Highness to commit me now.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>Why, this it is, when men are rul&#8217;d by women:</line>
<line>&#8217;Tis not the King that sends you to the Tower;</line>
<line>My Lady Grey his wife, Clarence, &#8217;tis she</line>
<line>That tempers him to this extremity.</line>
<line>Was it not she, and that good man of worship,</line>
<line>Anthony Woodvile, her brother there,</line>
<line>That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower,</line>
<line>From whence this present day he is delivered?</line>
<line>We are not safe, Clarence, we are not safe.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CLAR.</speaker>
<line>By heaven, I think there is no man is secure</line>
<line>But the Queen&#8217;s kindred, and night-walking heralds</line>
<line>That trudge betwixt the King and Mistress Shore.</line>
<line>Heard you not what an humble suppliant</line>
<line>Lord Hastings was to her for his delivery?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>Humbly complaining to her deity</line>
<line>Got my Lord Chamberlain his liberty.</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll tell you what, I think it is our way,</line>
<line>If we will keep in favor with the King,</line>
<line>To be her men and wear her livery.</line>
<line>The jealous o&#8217;erworn widow and herself,</line>
<line>Since that our brother dubb&#8217;d them gentlewomen,</line>
<line>Are mighty gossips in our monarchy.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BRAK.</speaker>
<line>I beseech your Graces both to pardon me:</line>
<line>His Majesty hath straitly given in charge</line>
<line>That no man shall have private conference</line>
<line>(Of what degree soever) with your brother.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>Even so? And please your worship, Brakenbury,</line>
<line>You may partake of any thing we say:</line>
<line>We speak no treason, man. We say the King</line>
<line>Is wise and virtuous, and his noble queen</line>
<line>Well strook in years, fair, and not jealious;</line>
<line>We say that Shore&#8217;s wife hath a pretty foot,</line>
<line>A cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue;</line>
<line>And that the Queen&#8217;s kindred are made gentlefolks.</line>
<line>How say you, sir? Can you deny all this?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BRAK.</speaker>
<line>With this, my lord, myself have nought to do.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>Naught to do with Mistress Shore? I tell thee, fellow,</line>
<line>He that doth naught with her (excepting one)</line>
<line>Were best to do it secretly alone.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BRAK.</speaker>
<line>What one, my lord?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>Her husband, knave. Wouldst thou betray me?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BRAK.</speaker>
<line>I do beseech your Grace to pardon me, and withal</line>
<line>Forbear your conference with the noble Duke.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CLAR.</speaker>
<line>We know thy charge, Brakenbury, and will obey.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>We are the Queen&#8217;s abjects, and must obey.</line>
<line>Brother, farewell, I will unto the King,</line>
<line>And whatsoe&#8217;er you will employ me in,</line>
<line>Were it to call King Edward&#8217;s widow sister,</line>
<line>I will perform it to enfranchise you.</line>
<line>Mean time, this deep disgrace in brotherhood</line>
<line>Touches me deeper than you can imagine.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CLAR.</speaker>
<line>I know it pleaseth neither of us well.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>Well, your imprisonment shall not be long,</line>
<line>I will deliver you, or else lie for you.</line>
<line>Mean time, have patience.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CLAR.</speaker>
<line offset="6">I must perforce. Farewell.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit Clarence with Brakenbury and Guard.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>Go tread the path that thou shalt ne&#8217;er return:</line>
<line>Simple plain Clarence, I do love thee so</line>
<line>That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven,</line>
<line>If heaven will take the present at our hands.</line>
<line>But who comes here? The new-delivered Hastings?</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Lord Hastings.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>HAST.</speaker>
<line>Good time of day unto my gracious lord!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>As much unto my good Lord Chamberlain!</line>
<line>Well are you welcome to the open air.</line>
<line>How hath your lordship brook&#8217;d imprisonment?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HAST.</speaker>
<line>With patience, noble lord, as prisoners must;</line>
<line>But I shall live, my lord, to give them thanks</line>
<line>That were the cause of my imprisonment.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>No doubt, no doubt, and so shall Clarence too,</line>
<line>For they that were your enemies are his,</line>
<line>And have prevail&#8217;d as much on him as you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HAST.</speaker>
<line>More pity that the eagles should be mew&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Whiles kites and buzzards prey at liberty.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>What news abroad?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HAST.</speaker>
<line>No news so bad abroad as this at home:</line>
<line>The King is sickly, weak, and melancholy,</line>
<line>And his physicians fear him mightily.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>Now by Saint John, that news is bad indeed!</line>
<line>O, he hath kept an evil diet long,</line>
<line>And overmuch consum&#8217;d his royal person:</line>
<line>&#8217;Tis very grievous to be thought upon.</line>
<line>Where is he? In his bed?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HAST.</speaker>
<line>He is.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>Go you before, and I will follow you.</line>

<stagedir>Exit Hastings.</stagedir>
<line>He cannot live, I hope, and must not die</line>
<line>Till George be pack&#8217;d with post-horse up to heaven.</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll in, to urge his hatred more to Clarence</line>
<line>With lies well steel&#8217;d with weighty arguments,</line>
<line>And if I fail not in my deep intent,</line>
<line>Clarence hath not another day to live:</line>
<line>Which done, God take King Edward to his mercy,</line>
<line>And leave the world for me to bustle in!</line>
<line>For then I&#8217;ll marry Warwick&#8217;s youngest daughter.</line>
<line>What though I kill&#8217;d her husband and her father?</line>
<line>The readiest way to make the wench amends</line>
<line>Is to become her husband and her father:</line>
<line>The which will I, not all so much for love</line>
<line>As for another secret close intent</line>
<line>By marrying her which I must reach unto.</line>
<line>But yet I run before my horse to market:</line>
<line>Clarence still breathes, Edward still lives and reigns;</line>
<line>When they are gone, then must I count my gains.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit.</stagedir>

<scenelocation>The same. Another street.</scenelocation>
<scenepersonae>(Henry the Sixth, Halberds, Lady Anne, Tressel, Berkeley, Richard Duke of Gloucester)</scenepersonae>

<stagedir>Enter the corpse of Henry the Sixth, with Halberds to guard it, Lady Anne being the mourner, attended by Tressel and Berkeley.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>ANNE.</speaker>
<line>Set down, set down your honorable load,</line>
<line>If honor may be shrouded in a hearse,</line>
<line>Whilst I awhile obsequiously lament</line>
<line>Th&#8217; untimely fall of virtuous Lancaster.</line>
<line>Poor key-cold figure of a holy king,</line>
<line>Pale ashes of the house of Lancaster,</line>
<line>Thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood,</line>
<line>Be it lawful that I invocate thy ghost</line>
<line>To hear the lamentations of poor Anne,</line>
<line>Wife to thy Edward, to thy slaught&#8217;red son,</line>
<line>Stabb&#8217;d by the self-same hand that made these wounds!</line>
<line>Lo, in these windows that let forth thy life</line>
<line>I pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes.</line>
<line>O, cursed be the hand that made these holes!</line>
<line>Cursed the heart that had the heart to do it!</line>
<line>Cursed the blood that let this blood from hence!</line>
<line>More direful hap betide that hated wretch</line>
<line>That makes us wretched by the death of thee</line>
<line>Than I can wish to wolves&#8212;to spiders, toads,</line>
<line>Or any creeping venom&#8217;d thing that lives!</line>
<line>If ever he have child, abortive be it,</line>
<line>Prodigious, and untimely brought to light,</line>
<line>Whose ugly and unnatural aspect</line>
<line>May fright the hopeful mother at the view,</line>
<line>And that be heir to his unhappiness!</line>
<line>If ever he have wife, let her be made</line>
<line>More miserable by the life of him</line>
<line>Than I am made by my young lord and thee!</line>
<line>Come now towards Chertsey with your holy load,</line>
<line>Taken from Paul&#8217;s to be interred there;</line>
<line>And still as you are weary of this weight,</line>
<line>Rest you, whiles I lament King Henry&#8217;s corse.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Richard Duke of Gloucester.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>Stay, you that bear the corse, and set it down.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANNE.</speaker>
<line>What black magician conjures up this fiend</line>
<line>To stop devoted charitable deeds?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>Villains, set down the corse, or, by Saint Paul,</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll make a corse of him that disobeys.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GENTLEMAN.</speaker>
<line>My lord, stand back, and let the coffin pass.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>Unmanner&#8217;d dog, stand thou when I command.</line>
<line>Advance thy halberd higher than my breast,</line>
<line>Or by Saint Paul I&#8217;ll strike thee to my foot,</line>
<line>And spurn upon thee, beggar, for thy boldness.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANNE.</speaker>
<line>What do you tremble? Are you all afraid?</line>
<line>Alas, I blame you not, for you are mortal,</line>
<line>And mortal eyes cannot endure the devil.&#8212;</line>
<line>Avaunt, thou dreadful minister of hell!</line>
<line>Thou hadst but power over his mortal body,</line>
<line>His soul thou canst not have. Therefore be gone.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>Sweet saint, for charity, be not so curst.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANNE.</speaker>
<line>Foul devil, for God&#8217;s sake hence, and trouble us not,</line>
<line>For thou hast made the happy earth thy hell,</line>
<line>Fill&#8217;d it with cursing cries and deep exclaims.</line>
<line>If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds,</line>
<line>Behold this pattern of thy butcheries.</line>
<line>O gentlemen, see, see dead Henry&#8217;s wounds</line>
<line>Open their congeal&#8217;d mouths and bleed afresh!</line>
<line>Blush, blush, thou lump of foul deformity;</line>
<line>For &#8217;tis thy presence that exhales this blood</line>
<line>From cold and empty veins where no blood dwells.</line>
<line>Thy deeds inhuman and unnatural</line>
<line>Provokes this deluge most unnatural.</line>
<line>O God! Which this blood mad&#8217;st, revenge his death!</line>
<line>O earth! Which this blood drink&#8217;st, revenge his death!</line>
<line>Either heav&#8217;n with lightning strike the murth&#8217;rer dead;</line>
<line>Or earth gape open wide and eat him quick,</line>
<line>As thou dost swallow up this good king&#8217;s blood,</line>
<line>Which his hell-govern&#8217;d arm hath butchered!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>Lady, you know no rules of charity,</line>
<line>Which renders good for bad, blessings for curses.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANNE.</speaker>
<line>Villain, thou know&#8217;st nor law of God nor man:</line>
<line>No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>But I know none, and therefore am no beast.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANNE.</speaker>
<line>O wonderful, when devils tell the troth!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>More wonderful, when angels are so angry.</line>
<line>Vouchsafe, divine perfection of a woman,</line>
<line>Of these supposed crimes, to give me leave</line>
<line>By circumstance but to acquit myself.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANNE.</speaker>
<line>Vouchsafe, defus&#8217;d infection of a man,</line>
<line>Of these known evils, but to give me leave</line>
<line>By circumstance t&#8217; accuse thy cursed self.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have</line>
<line>Some patient leisure to excuse myself.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANNE.</speaker>
<line>Fouler than heart can think thee, thou canst make</line>
<line>No excuse current but to hang thyself.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>By such despair I should accuse myself.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANNE.</speaker>
<line>And by despairing shalt thou stand excused</line>
<line>For doing worthy vengeance on thyself,</line>
<line>That didst unworthy slaughter upon others.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>Say that I slew them not?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANNE.</speaker>
<line>Then say they were not slain.</line>
<line>But dead they are, and, devilish slave, by thee.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>I did not kill your husband.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANNE.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Why then he is alive.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>Nay, he is dead, and slain by Edward&#8217;s hands.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANNE.</speaker>
<line>In thy foul throat thou li&#8217;st! Queen Margaret saw</line>
<line>Thy murd&#8217;rous falchion smoking in his blood;</line>
<line>The which thou once didst bend against her breast,</line>
<line>But that thy brothers beat aside the point.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>I was provoked by her sland&#8217;rous tongue,</line>
<line>That laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANNE.</speaker>
<line>Thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind,</line>
<line>That never dream&#8217;st on aught but butcheries.</line>
<line>Didst thou not kill this king?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line offset="7">I grant ye.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANNE.</speaker>
<line>Dost grant me, hedgehog? Then God grant me too</line>
<line>Thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed!</line>
<line>O, he was gentle, mild, and virtuous!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>The better for the King of Heaven that hath him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANNE.</speaker>
<line>He is in heaven, where thou shalt never come.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>Let him thank me that holp to send him thither;</line>
<line>For he was fitter for that place than earth.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANNE.</speaker>
<line>And thou unfit for any place, but hell.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>Yes, one place else, if you will hear me name it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANNE.</speaker>
<line>Some dungeon.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Your bedchamber.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANNE.</speaker>
<line>Ill rest betide the chamber where thou liest!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>So will it, madam, till I lie with you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANNE.</speaker>
<line>I hope so.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>I know so. But, gentle Lady Anne,</line>
<line>To leave this keen encounter of our wits</line>
<line>And fall something into a slower method:</line>
<line>Is not the causer of the timeless deaths</line>
<line>Of these Plantagenets, Henry and Edward,</line>
<line>As blameful as the executioner?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANNE.</speaker>
<line>Thou wast the cause, and most accurs&#8217;d effect.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>Your beauty was the cause of that effect&#8212;</line>
<line>Your beauty, that did haunt me in my sleep</line>
<line>To undertake the death of all the world,</line>
<line>So I might live one hour in your sweet bosom.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANNE.</speaker>
<line>If I thought that, I tell thee, homicide,</line>
<line>These nails should rent that beauty from my cheeks.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>These eyes could not endure that beauty&#8217;s wrack;</line>
<line>You should not blemish it, if I stood by:</line>
<line>As all the world is cheered by the sun,</line>
<line>So I by that; it is my day, my life.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANNE.</speaker>
<line>Black night o&#8217;ershade thy day, and death thy life!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>Curse not thyself, fair creature&#8212;thou art both.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANNE.</speaker>
<line>I would I were, to be reveng&#8217;d on thee.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>It is a quarrel most unnatural,</line>
<line>To be reveng&#8217;d on him that loveth thee.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANNE.</speaker>
<line>It is a quarrel just and reasonable,</line>
<line>To be reveng&#8217;d on him that kill&#8217;d my husband.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>He that bereft thee, lady, of thy husband,</line>
<line>Did it to help thee to a better husband.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANNE.</speaker>
<line>His better doth not breathe upon the earth.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>He lives, that loves thee better than he could.</line>

<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>Thine eyes, sweet lady, have infected mine.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANNE.</speaker>
<line>Would they were basilisks, to strike thee dead!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>I would they were, that I might die at once;</line>
<line>For now they kill me with a living death.</line>
<line>Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears,</line>
<line>Sham&#8217;d their aspects with store of childish drops:</line>
<line>These eyes, which never shed remorseful tear&#8212;</line>
<line>No, when my father York and Edward wept</line>
<line>To hear the piteous moan that Rutland made</line>
<line>When black-fac&#8217;d Clifford shook his sword at him;</line>
<line>Nor when thy warlike father, like a child,</line>
<line>Told the sad story of my father&#8217;s death,</line>
<line>And twenty times made pause to sob and weep,</line>
<line>That all the standers-by had wet their cheeks</line>
<line>Like trees bedash&#8217;d with rain&#8212;in that sad time</line>
<line>My manly eyes did scorn an humble tear;</line>
<line>And what these sorrows could not thence exhale,</line>
<line>Thy beauty hath, and made them blind with weeping.</line>
<line>I never sued to friend nor enemy;</line>
<line>My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word;</line>
<line>But now thy beauty is propos&#8217;d my fee,</line>
<line>My proud heart sues, and prompts my tongue to speak.</line>
<stagedir>She looks scornfully at him.</stagedir>
<line>Teach not thy lip such scorn; for it was made</line>
<line>For kissing, lady, not for such contempt.</line>
<line>If thy revengeful heart cannot forgive,</line>
<line>Lo here I lend thee this sharp-pointed sword,</line>
<line>Which if thou please to hide in this true breast,</line>
<line>And let the soul forth that adoreth thee,</line>
<line>I lay it naked to the deadly stroke,</line>
<line>And humbly beg the death upon my knee.</line>
<stagedir>He lays his breast open: she offers at it with his sword.</stagedir>
<line>Nay, do not pause: for I did kill King Henry&#8212;</line>
<line>But &#8217;twas thy beauty that provoked me.</line>
<line>Nay, now dispatch: &#8217;twas I that stabb&#8217;d young Edward</line>
<line>But &#8217;twas thy heavenly face that set me on.</line>
<stagedir>She falls the sword.</stagedir>
<line>Take up the sword again, or take up me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANNE.</speaker>
<line>Arise, dissembler! Though I wish thy death,</line>
<line>I will not be thy executioner.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>Then bid me kill myself, and I will do it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANNE.</speaker>
<line>I have already.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line offset="5">That was in thy rage.</line>
<line>Speak it again, and even with the word</line>
<line>This hand, which for thy love did kill thy love,</line>
<line>Shall for thy love kill a far truer love;</line>
<line>To both their deaths shalt thou be accessary.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANNE.</speaker>
<line>I would I knew thy heart.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>&#8217;Tis figur&#8217;d in my tongue.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANNE.</speaker>
<line>I fear me both are false.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>Then never was man true.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANNE.</speaker>
<line>Well, well, put up your sword.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>Say then my peace is made.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANNE.</speaker>
<line>That shalt thou know hereafter.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>But shall I live in hope?</line>

<speech>
<speaker>ANNE.</speaker>
<line>All men, I hope, live so.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>Vouchsafe to wear this ring.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANNE.</speaker>
<line>To take is not to give.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Gloucester slips the ring on her finger.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>Look how my ring encompasseth thy finger,</line>
<line>Even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart:</line>
<line>Wear both of them, for both of them are thine.</line>
<line>And if thy poor devoted servant may</line>
<line>But beg one favor at thy gracious hand,</line>
<line>Thou dost confirm his happiness forever.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANNE.</speaker>
<line>What is it?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>That it may please you leave these sad designs</line>
<line>To him that hath most cause to be a mourner,</line>
<line>And presently repair to Crosby House;</line>
<line>Where (after I have solemnly interr&#8217;d</line>
<line>At Chertsey monast&#8217;ry this noble king,</line>
<line>And wet his grave with my repentant tears)</line>
<line>I will with all expedient duty see you.</line>
<line>For divers unknown reasons, I beseech you,</line>
<line>Grant me this boon.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANNE.</speaker>
<line>With all my heart, and much it joys me too,</line>
<line>To see you are become so penitent.</line>
<line>Tressel and Berkeley, go along with me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>Bid me farewell.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANNE.</speaker>
<line offset="6">&#8217;Tis more than you deserve;</line>
<line>But since you teach me how to flatter you,</line>

<line>No; to White-Friars, there attend my coming.</line>

<stagedir>Exit corse with Halberds.</stagedir>
<line>Was ever woman in this humor woo&#8217;d?</line>
<line>Was ever woman in this humor won?</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll have her, but I will not keep her long.</line>
<line>What? I, that kill&#8217;d her husband and his father,</line>
<line>To take her in her heart&#8217;s extremest hate,</line>
<line>With curses in her mouth, tears in her eyes,</line>
<line>The bleeding witness of my hatred by,</line>
<line>Having God, her conscience, and these bars against me,</line>
<line>And I no friends to back my suit at all</line>
<line>But the plain devil and dissembling looks?</line>
<line>And yet to win her! All the world to nothing!</line>
<line>Hah!</line>
<line>Hath she forgot already that brave prince,</line>
<line>Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since,</line>
<line>Stabb&#8217;d in my angry mood at Tewksbury?</line>
<line>A sweeter and a lovelier gentleman,</line>
<line>Fram&#8217;d in the prodigality of nature&#8212;</line>
<line>Young, valiant, wise, and (no doubt) right royal&#8212;</line>
<line>The spacious world cannot again afford.</line>
<line>And will she yet abase her eyes on me,</line>
<line>That cropp&#8217;d the golden prime of this sweet prince</line>
<line>And made her widow to a woeful bed?</line>
<line>On me, whose all not equals Edward&#8217;s moi&#8217;ty?</line>
<line>On me, that halts and am misshapen thus?</line>
<line>My dukedom to a beggarly denier,</line>
<line>I do mistake my person all this while!</line>
<line>Upon my life, she finds (although I cannot)</line>
<line>Myself to be a marv&#8217;llous proper man.</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll be at charges for a looking-glass,</line>
<line>And entertain a score or two of tailors</line>
<line>To study fashions to adorn my body:</line>
<line>Since I am crept in favor with myself,</line>
<line>I will maintain it with some little cost.</line>
<line>But first I&#8217;ll turn yon fellow in his grave,</line>
<line>And then return lamenting to my love.</line>
<line>Shine out, fair sun, till I have bought a glass,</line>
<line>That I may see my shadow as I pass.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>RIV.</speaker>
<line>Have patience, madam, there&#8217;s no doubt his Majesty</line>
<line>Will soon recover his accustom&#8217;d health.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GREY.</speaker>
<line>In that you brook it ill, it makes him worse;</line>
<line>Therefore for God&#8217;s sake entertain good comfort,</line>
<line>And cheer his Grace with quick and merry eyes.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. ELIZ.</speaker>
<line>If he were dead, what would betide on me?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GREY.</speaker>
<line>No other harm but loss of such a lord.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. ELIZ.</speaker>
<line>The loss of such a lord includes all harms.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GREY.</speaker>
<line>The heavens have blest you with a goodly son</line>
<line>To be your comforter when he is gone.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. ELIZ.</speaker>
<line>Ah! He is young; and his minority</line>
<line>Is put unto the trust of Richard Gloucester,</line>
<line>A man that loves not me, nor none of you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>RIV.</speaker>
<line>Is it concluded he shall be Protector?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. ELIZ.</speaker>
<line>It is determin&#8217;d, not concluded yet;</line>
<line>But so it must be, if the King miscarry.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Buckingham and Lord Stanley, Earl of Derby.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>GREY.</speaker>
<line>Here come the lords of Buckingham and Derby.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BUCK.</speaker>
<line>Good time of day unto your royal Grace!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>STAN.</speaker>
<line>God make your Majesty joyful, as you have been!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. ELIZ.</speaker>
<line>The Countess Richmond, good my Lord of Derby,</line>
<line>To your good prayer will scarcely say amen.</line>
<line>Yet, Derby, notwithstanding she&#8217;s your wife</line>
<line>And loves not me, be you, good lord, assur&#8217;d</line>
<line>I hate not you for her proud arrogance.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>STAN.</speaker>
<line>I do beseech you, either not believe</line>
<line>The envious slanders of her false accusers;</line>
<line>Or if she be accus&#8217;d on true report,</line>
<line>Bear with her weakness, which I think proceeds</line>
<line>From wayward sickness and no grounded malice.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. ELIZ.</speaker>
<line>Saw you the King today, my Lord of Derby?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>STAN.</speaker>
<line>But now the Duke of Buckingham and I</line>
<line>Are come from visiting his Majesty.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. ELIZ.</speaker>
<line>What likelihood of his amendment, lords?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BUCK.</speaker>
<line>Madam, good hope, his Grace speaks cheerfully.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. ELIZ.</speaker>
<line>God grant him health! Did you confer with him?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BUCK.</speaker>
<line>Ay, madam, he desires to make atonement</line>
<line>Between the Duke of Gloucester and your brothers,</line>
<line>And between them and my Lord Chamberlain,</line>
<line>And sent to warn them to his royal presence.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. ELIZ.</speaker>
<line>Would all were well! But that will never be:</line>
<line>I fear our happiness is at the height.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Richard Duke of Gloucester and Lord Hastings.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>They do me wrong, and I will not endure it!</line>
<line>Who is it that complains unto the King</line>
<line>That I, forsooth, am stern, and love them not?</line>
<line>By holy Paul, they love his Grace but lightly</line>
<line>That fill his ears with such dissentious rumors.</line>
<line>Because I cannot flatter and look fair,</line>
<line>Smile in men&#8217;s faces, smooth, deceive, and cog,</line>
<line>Duck with French nods and apish courtesy,</line>
<line>I must be held a rancorous enemy.</line>
<line>Cannot a plain man live and think no harm,</line>
<line>But thus his simple truth must be abus&#8217;d</line>
<line>With silken, sly, insinuating Jacks?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GREY.</speaker>
<line>To who in all this presence speaks your Grace?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>To thee, that hast nor honesty nor grace:</line>
<line>When have I injur&#8217;d thee? When done thee wrong?</line>
<line>Or thee? Or thee? Or any of your faction?</line>
<line>A plague upon you all! His royal Grace</line>
<line>(Whom God preserve better than you would wish!)</line>
<line>Cannot be quiet scarce a breathing while</line>
<line>But you must trouble him with lewd complaints.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. ELIZ.</speaker>
<line>Brother of Gloucester, you mistake the matter:</line>
<line>The King, on his own royal disposition</line>
<line>(And not provok&#8217;d by any suitor else),</line>
<line>Aiming, belike, at your interior hatred,</line>
<line>That in your outward action shows itself</line>
<line>Against my children, brothers, and myself,</line>
<line>Makes him to send, that he may learn the ground.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>I cannot tell, the world is grown so bad</line>
<line>That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch.</line>
<line>Since every Jack became a gentleman,</line>
<line>There&#8217;s many a gentle person made a Jack.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. ELIZ.</speaker>
<line>Come, come, we know your meaning, brother Gloucester;</line>
<line>You envy my advancement and my friends&#8217;.</line>
<line>God grant we never may have need of you!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>Mean time, God grants that I have need of you.</line>
<line>Our brother is imprison&#8217;d by your means,</line>
<line>Myself disgrac&#8217;d, and the nobility</line>
<line>Held in contempt, while great promotions</line>
<line>Are daily given to ennoble those</line>
<line>That scarce some two days since were worth a noble.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. ELIZ.</speaker>
<line>By Him that rais&#8217;d me to this careful height</line>
<line>From that contented hap which I enjoy&#8217;d,</line>
<line>I never did incense his Majesty</line>
<line>Against the Duke of Clarence, but have been</line>
<line>An earnest advocate to plead for him.</line>
<line>My lord, you do me shameful injury</line>
<line>Falsely to draw me in these vile suspects.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>You may deny that you were not the mean</line>
<line>Of my Lord Hastings&#8217; late imprisonment.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>RIV.</speaker>
<line>She may, my lord, for&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>She may, Lord Rivers! Why, who knows not so?</line>
<line>She may do more, sir, than denying that:</line>
<line>She may help you to many fair preferments,</line>
<line>And then deny her aiding hand therein</line>
<line>And lay those honors on your high desert.</line>
<line>What may she not, she may, ay, marry, may she.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>RIV.</speaker>
<line>What, marry, may she?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>What, marry, may she? Marry with a king,</line>
<line>A bachelor, and a handsome stripling too:</line>
<line>Iwis your grandam had a worser match.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. ELIZ.</speaker>
<line>My Lord of Gloucester, I have too long borne</line>
<line>Your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs.</line>
<line>By heaven, I will acquaint his Majesty</line>
<line>Of those gross taunts that oft I have endur&#8217;d.</line>
<line>I had rather be a country servant maid</line>
<line>Than a great queen with this condition,</line>
<line>To be so baited, scorn&#8217;d, and stormed at.</line>

<stagedir>Enter old Queen Margaret behind.</stagedir>
<line>Small joy have I in being England&#8217;s queen.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. MAR.</speaker>
<stagedir>Aside.</stagedir>
<line>And less&#8217;ned be that small, God I beseech him!</line>
<line>Thy honor, state, and seat is due to me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>What? Threat you me with telling of the King?</line>
<line>Tell him, and spare not. Look what I have said,</line>
<line>I will avouch&#8217;t in presence of the King.</line>
<line>I dare adventure to be sent to th&#8217; Tow&#8217;r.</line>
<line>&#8217;Tis time to speak, my pains are quite forgot.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. MAR.</speaker>
<stagedir>Aside.</stagedir>
<line>Out, devil! I do remember them too well:</line>
<line>Thou kill&#8217;dst my husband Henry in the Tower,</line>
<line>And Edward, my poor son, at Tewksbury.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>Ere you were queen, ay, or your husband king,</line>
<line>I was a pack-horse in his great affairs:</line>
<line>A weeder-out of his proud adversaries,</line>
<line>A liberal rewarder of his friends;</line>
<line>To royalize his blood I spent mine own.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. MAR.</speaker>
<stagedir>Aside.</stagedir>
<line>Ay, and much better blood than his or thine.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>In all which time you and your husband Grey</line>
<line>Were factious for the house of Lancaster;</line>
<line>And, Rivers, so were you. Was not your husband</line>
<line>In Margaret&#8217;s battle at Saint Albons slain?</line>
<line>Let me put in your minds, if you forget,</line>
<line>What you have been ere this, and what you are;</line>
<line>Withal, what I have been, and what I am.</line>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Q. MAR.</speaker>
<stagedir>Aside.</stagedir>
<line>A murth&#8217;rous villain, and so still thou art.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>Poor Clarence did forsake his father, Warwick,</line>
<line>Ay, and forswore himself&#8212;which Jesu pardon!&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. MAR.</speaker>
<stagedir>Aside.</stagedir>
<line>Which God revenge!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>To fight on Edward&#8217;s party for the crown,</line>
<line>And for his meed, poor lord, he is mewed up.</line>
<line>I would to God my heart were flint, like Edward&#8217;s,</line>
<line>Or Edward&#8217;s soft and pitiful, like mine:</line>
<line>I am too childish-foolish for this world.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. MAR.</speaker>
<stagedir>Aside.</stagedir>
<line>Hie thee to hell for shame, and leave this world,</line>
<line>Thou cacodemon, there thy kingdom is.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>RIV.</speaker>
<line>My Lord of Gloucester, in those busy days,</line>
<line>Which here you urge to prove us enemies,</line>
<line>We follow&#8217;d then our lord, our sovereign king.</line>
<line>So should we you, if you should be our king.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>If I should be? I had rather be a pedlar:</line>
<line>Far be it from my heart, the thought thereof!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. ELIZ.</speaker>
<line>As little joy, my lord, as you suppose</line>
<line>You should enjoy, were you this country&#8217;s king&#8212;</line>
<line>As little joy you may suppose in me</line>
<line>That I enjoy, being the queen thereof.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. MAR.</speaker>
<stagedir>Aside.</stagedir>
<line>A little joy enjoys the queen thereof,</line>
<line>For I am she, and altogether joyless.</line>
<line>I can no longer hold me patient.</line>

<stagedir>Comes forward.</stagedir>
<line>Hear me, you wrangling pirates, that fall out</line>
<line>In sharing that which you have pill&#8217;d from me!</line>
<line>Which of you trembles not that looks on me?</line>
<line>If not, that I am queen, you bow like subjects,</line>
<line>Yet that, by you depos&#8217;d, you quake like rebels?</line>
<line>Ah, gentle villain, do not turn away!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>Foul wrinkled witch, what mak&#8217;st thou in my sight?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. MAR.</speaker>
<line>But repetition of what thou hast marr&#8217;d,</line>
<line>That will I make before I let thee go.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>Wert thou not banished on pain of death?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. MAR.</speaker>
<line>I was; but I do find more pain in banishment</line>
<line>Than death can yield me here by my abode.</line>
<line>A husband and a son thou ow&#8217;st to me&#8212;</line>
<line>And thou a kingdom&#8212;all of you allegiance.</line>
<line>This sorrow that I have, by right is yours,</line>
<line>And all the pleasures you usurp are mine.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>The curse my noble father laid on thee</line>
<line>When thou didst crown his warlike brows with paper,</line>
<line>And with thy scorns drew&#8217;st rivers from his eyes,</line>
<line>And then, to dry them, gav&#8217;st the Duke a clout</line>
<line>Steep&#8217;d in the faultless blood of pretty Rutland&#8212;</line>
<line>His curses then, from bitterness of soul</line>
<line>Denounc&#8217;d against thee, are all fall&#8217;n upon thee;</line>
<line>And God, not we, hath plagu&#8217;d thy bloody deed.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. ELIZ.</speaker>
<line>So just is God, to right the innocent.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HAST.</speaker>
<line>O, &#8217;twas the foulest deed to slay that babe,</line>
<line>And the most merciless, that e&#8217;er was heard of!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>RIV.</speaker>
<line>Tyrants themselves wept when it was reported.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DOR.</speaker>
<line>No man but prophesied revenge for it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BUCK.</speaker>
<line>Northumberland, then present, wept to see it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. MAR.</speaker>
<line>What? Were you snarling all before I came,</line>
<line>Ready to catch each other by the throat,</line>
<line>And turn you all your hatred now on me?</line>
<line>Did York&#8217;s dread curse prevail so much with heaven</line>
<line>That Henry&#8217;s death, my lovely Edward&#8217;s death,</line>
<line>Their kingdom&#8217;s loss, my woeful banishment,</line>
<line>Should all but answer for that peevish brat?</line>
<line>Can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven?</line>
<line>Why then give way, dull clouds, to my quick curses!</line>
<line>Though not by war, by surfeit die your king,</line>
<line>As ours by murder, to make him a king!</line>
<line>Edward thy son, that now is Prince of Wales,</line>
<line>For Edward our son, that was Prince of Wales,</line>

<line>Long die thy happy days before thy death,</line>

<line>Die neither mother, wife, nor England&#8217;s queen!</line>
<line>Rivers and Dorset, you were standers-by,</line>
<line>And so wast thou, Lord Hastings, when my son</line>

<line>Peace, Master Marquess, you are malapert,</line>
<line>Your fire-new stamp of honor is scarce current.</line>
<line>O that your young nobility could judge</line>
<line>What &#8217;twere to lose it and be miserable!</line>

<line>Uncharitably with me have you dealt,</line>

<line>I never did her any to my knowledge.</line>

<line>Yet you have all the vantage of her wrong.</line>
<line>I was too hot to do somebody good</line>
<line>That is too cold in thinking of it now.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>I do the wrong, and first begin to brawl.</line>
<line>The secret mischiefs that I set abroach</line>
<line>I lay unto the grievous charge of others.</line>
<line>Clarence, who I indeed have cast in darkness,</line>
<line>I do beweep to many simple gulls&#8212;</line>
<line>Namely, to Derby, Hastings, Buckingham&#8212;</line>
<line>And tell them &#8217;tis the Queen and her allies</line>
<line>That stir the King against the Duke my brother.</line>
<line>Now they believe it, and withal whet me</line>
<line>To be reveng&#8217;d on Rivers, Dorset, Grey.</line>
<line>But then I sigh, and, with a piece of scripture,</line>
<line>Tell them that God bids us do good for evil:</line>
<line>And thus I clothe my naked villainy</line>
<line>With odd old ends stol&#8217;n forth of holy writ,</line>
<line>And seem a saint, when most I play the devil.</line>

<stagedir>Enter two Murderers.</stagedir>
<line>But soft, here come my executioners.</line>

<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>Well thought upon, I have it here about me.</line>

<stagedir>Gives the warrant.</stagedir>
<line>When you have done, repair to Crosby Place.</line>
<line>But, sirs, be sudden in the execution,</line>
<line>Withal obdurate, do not hear him plead;</line>
<line>For Clarence is well-spoken, and perhaps</line>
<line>May move your hearts to pity if you mark him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. MUR.</speaker>
<line>Tut, tut, my lord, we will not stand to prate;</line>
<line>Talkers are no good doers. Be assur&#8217;d;</line>

<stagedir>Enter Clarence and Keeper.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>KEEP.</speaker>
<line>Why looks your Grace so heavily today?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CLAR.</speaker>
<line>O, I have pass&#8217;d a miserable night,</line>
<line>So full of fearful dreams, of ugly sights,</line>
<line>That, as I am a Christian faithful man,</line>
<line>I would not spend another such a night</line>
<line>Though &#8217;twere to buy a world of happy days&#8212;</line>
<line>So full of dismal terror was the time.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KEEP.</speaker>
<line>What was your dream, my lord? I pray you tell me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CLAR.</speaker>
<line>Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower</line>
<line>And was embark&#8217;d to cross to Burgundy,</line>
<line>And in my company my brother Gloucester,</line>
<line>Who from my cabin tempted me to walk</line>
<line>Upon the hatches. Thence we look&#8217;d toward England,</line>
<line>And cited up a thousand heavy times,</line>
<line>During the wars of York and Lancaster,</line>
<line>That had befall&#8217;n us. As we pac&#8217;d along</line>
<line>Upon the giddy footing of the hatches,</line>
<line>Methought that Gloucester stumbled, and in falling</line>
<line>Strook me (that thought to stay him) overboard</line>
<line>Into the tumbling billows of the main.</line>
<line>O Lord, methought what pain it was to drown!</line>
<line>What dreadful noise of waters in my ears!</line>
<line>What sights of ugly death within my eyes!</line>
<line>Methoughts I saw a thousand fearful wracks;</line>
<line>A thousand men that fishes gnaw&#8217;d upon;</line>
<line>Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,</line>
<line>Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels,</line>
<line>All scatt&#8217;red in the bottom of the sea:</line>
<line>Some lay in dead men&#8217;s skulls, and in the holes</line>
<line>Where eyes did once inhabit, there were crept</line>
<line>(As &#8217;twere in scorn of eyes) reflecting gems,</line>
<line>That woo&#8217;d the slimy bottom of the deep,</line>
<line>And mock&#8217;d the dead bones that lay scatt&#8217;red by.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KEEP.</speaker>
<line>Had you such leisure in the time of death</line>
<line>To gaze upon these secrets of the deep?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CLAR.</speaker>
<line>Methought I had, and often did I strive</line>
<line>To yield the ghost; but still the envious flood</line>
<line>Stopp&#8217;d in my soul, and would not let it forth</line>
<line>To find the empty, vast, and wand&#8217;ring air,</line>
<line>But smother&#8217;d it within my panting bulk,</line>
<line>Who almost burst to belch it in the sea.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KEEP.</speaker>
<line>Awak&#8217;d you not in this sore agony?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CLAR.</speaker>
<line>No, no, my dream was lengthen&#8217;d after life.</line>
<line>O then began the tempest to my soul!</line>
<line>I pass&#8217;d (methought) the melancholy flood,</line>
<line>With that sour ferryman which poets write of,</line>
<line>Unto the kingdom of perpetual night.</line>
<line>The first that there did greet my stranger soul</line>
<line>Was my great father-in-law, renowned Warwick,</line>
<line>Who spake aloud, &#8220;What scourge for perjury</line>
<line>Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence?&#8221;</line>
<line>And so he vanish&#8217;d. Then came wand&#8217;ring by</line>
<line>A shadow like an angel, with bright hair</line>
<line>Dabbled in blood, and he shriek&#8217;d out aloud,</line>
<line>&#8220;Clarence is come&#8212;false, fleeting, perjur&#8217;d Clarence,</line>
<line>That stabb&#8217;d me in the field by Tewksbury:</line>
<line>Seize on him, Furies, take him unto torment!&#8221;</line>
<line>With that (methoughts) a legion of foul fiends</line>
<line>Environ&#8217;d me, and howled in mine ears</line>
<line>Such hideous cries that with the very noise</line>
<line>I, trembling, wak&#8217;d, and for a season after</line>
<line>Could not believe but that I was in hell,</line>
<line>Such terrible impression made my dream.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KEEP.</speaker>
<line>No marvel, lord, though it affrighted you;</line>
<line>I am afraid (methinks) to hear you tell it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KEEP.</speaker>
<line>Ah, Keeper, Keeper, I have done these things</line>
<line>(That now give evidence against my soul)</line>
<line>For Edward&#8217;s sake, and see how he requites me!</line>
<line>O God! If my deep pray&#8217;rs cannot appease thee,</line>
<line>But thou wilt be aveng&#8217;d on my misdeeds,</line>
<line>Yet execute thy wrath in me alone!</line>
<line>O, spare my guiltless wife and my poor children!</line>
<line>Keeper, I prithee sit by me awhile.</line>
<line>My soul is heavy, and I fain would sleep.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KEEP.</speaker>
<line>I will, my lord. God give your Grace good rest!</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Clarence sleeps.</stagedir>

<stagedir>Enter Brakenbury, the Lieutenant.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>BRAK.</speaker>
<line>Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours,</line>
<line>Makes the night morning and the noontide night:</line>
<line>Princes have but their titles for their glories,</line>
<line>An outward honor for an inward toil,</line>
<line>And for unfelt imaginations</line>
<line>They often feel a world of restless cares;</line>
<line>So that between their titles and low name</line>
<line>There&#8217;s nothing differs but the outward fame.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter two Murderers.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>1. MUR.</speaker>
<line>Ho, who&#8217;s here?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BRAK.</speaker>
<line>What wouldst thou, fellow? And how cam&#8217;st thou hither?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. MUR.</speaker>
<line>I would speak with Clarence, and I came hither on my legs.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BRAK.</speaker>
<line>What, so brief?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. MUR.</speaker>
<line>&#8217;Tis better, sir, than to be tedious. Let him see our commission, and talk no more.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Brakenbury reads it.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>BRAK.</speaker>
<line>I am in this commanded to deliver</line>
<line>The noble Duke of Clarence to your hands.</line>
<line>I will not reason what is meant hereby,</line>
<line>Because I will be guiltless from the meaning.</line>
<line>There lies the Duke asleep, and there the keys.</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll to the King and signify to him</line>
<line>That thus I have resign&#8217;d to you my charge.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. MUR.</speaker>
<line>You may, sir, &#8217;tis a point of wisdom. Fare you well.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit Brakenbury with Keeper.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>2. MUR.</speaker>
<line>What, shall I stab him as he sleeps?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. MUR.</speaker>
<line>No, he&#8217;ll say &#8217;twas done cowardly when he wakes.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. MUR.</speaker>
<line>Why, he shall never wake until the great Judgment Day.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. MUR.</speaker>
<line>Why, then he&#8217;ll say we stabb&#8217;d him sleeping.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. MUR.</speaker>
<line>The urging of that word &#8220;judgment&#8221; hath bred a kind of remorse in me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. MUR.</speaker>
<line>What? Art thou afraid?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. MUR.</speaker>
<line>Not to kill him, having a warrant, but to be damn&#8217;d for killing him, from the which no warrant can defend me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. MUR.</speaker>
<line>I thought thou hadst been resolute.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. MUR.</speaker>
<line>So I am&#8212;to let him live.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. MUR.</speaker>
<line>I&#8217;ll back to the Duke of Gloucester and tell him so.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. MUR.</speaker>
<line>Nay, I prithee stay a little. I hope this passionate humor of mine will change. It was wont to hold me but while one tells twenty.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. MUR.</speaker>
<line>How dost thou feel thyself now?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. MUR.</speaker>
<line>Faith, some certain dregs of conscience are yet within me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. MUR.</speaker>
<line>Remember our reward when the deed&#8217;s done.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. MUR.</speaker>
<line>&#8217;Zounds, he dies! I had forgot the reward.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. MUR.</speaker>
<line>Where&#8217;s thy conscience now?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. MUR.</speaker>
<line>O, in the Duke of Gloucester&#8217;s purse.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. MUR.</speaker>
<line>When he opens his purse to give us our reward, thy conscience flies out.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. MUR.</speaker>
<line>&#8217;Tis no matter, let it go. There&#8217;s few or none will entertain it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. MUR.</speaker>
<line>What if it come to thee again?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. MUR.</speaker>
<line>I&#8217;ll not meddle with it, it makes a man a coward. A man cannot steal, but it accuseth him; a man cannot swear, but it checks him; a man cannot lie with his neighbor&#8217;s wife, but it detects him. &#8217;Tis a blushing shame-fac&#8217;d spirit that mutinies in a man&#8217;s bosom. It fills a man full of obstacles. It made me once restore a purse of gold that (by chance) I found. It beggars any man that keeps it. It is turn&#8217;d out of towns and cities for a dangerous thing, and every man that means to live well endeavors to trust to himself and live without it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. MUR.</speaker>
<line>&#8217;Zounds, &#8217;tis even now at my elbow, persuading me not to kill the Duke.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. MUR.</speaker>
<line>Take the devil in thy mind, and believe him not; he would insinuate with thee but to make thee sigh.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. MUR.</speaker>
<line>I am strong-fram&#8217;d, he cannot prevail with me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. MUR.</speaker>
<line>Spoke like a tall man that respects thy reputation. Come, shall we fall to work?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. MUR.</speaker>
<line>Take him on the costard with the hilts of thy sword, and then throw him into the malmsey-butt in the next room.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. MUR.</speaker>
<line>O excellent device! And make a sop of him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. MUR.</speaker>
<line>Soft, he wakes.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. MUR.</speaker>
<line>Strike!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. MUR.</speaker>
<line>No, we&#8217;ll reason with him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CLAR.</speaker>
<line>Where art thou, Keeper? Give me a cup of wine.</line>

<line>In God&#8217;s name, what art thou?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. MUR.</speaker>
<line>A man, as you are.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CLAR.</speaker>
<line>But not, as I am, royal.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. MUR.</speaker>
<line>Nor you, as we are, loyal.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CLAR.</speaker>
<line>Thy voice is thunder, but thy looks are humble.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. MUR.</speaker>
<line>My voice is now the King&#8217;s, my looks mine own.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CLAR.</speaker>
<line>How darkly and how deadly dost thou speak!</line>
<line>Your eyes do menace me. Why look you pale?</line>
<line>Who sent you hither? Wherefore do you come?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BOTH. 1. MUR. AND 2. MUR.</speaker>
<line>To, to, to&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CLAR.</speaker>
<line>To murder me?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BOTH. 1. MUR. AND 2. MUR.</speaker>
<line>Ay, ay.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CLAR.</speaker>
<line>You scarcely have the hearts to tell me so,</line>
<line>And therefore cannot have the hearts to do it.</line>
<line>Wherein, my friends, have I offended you?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. MUR.</speaker>
<line>Offended us you have not, but the King.</line>

<line>Never, my lord, therefore prepare to die.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CLAR.</speaker>
<line>Are you drawn forth among a world of men</line>
<line>To slay the innocent? What is my offense?</line>
<line>Where is the evidence that doth accuse me?</line>
<line>What lawful quest have given their verdict up</line>
<line>Unto the frowning judge? Or who pronounc&#8217;d</line>
<line>The bitter sentence of poor Clarence&#8217; death?</line>
<line>Before I be convict by course of law,</line>
<line>To threaten me with death is most unlawful.</line>
<line>I charge you, as you hope to have redemption</line>
<line>By Christ&#8217;s dear blood shed for our grievous sins,</line>
<line>That you depart, and lay no hands on me.</line>
<line>The deed you undertake is damnable.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. MUR.</speaker>
<line>What we will do, we do upon command.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. MUR.</speaker>
<line>And he that hath commanded is our King.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CLAR.</speaker>
<line>Erroneous vassals, the great King of kings</line>
<line>Hath in the table of his law commanded</line>
<line>That thou shalt do no murder. Will you then</line>
<line>Spurn at his edict, and fulfill a man&#8217;s?</line>
<line>Take heed; for he holds vengeance in his hand,</line>
<line>To hurl upon their heads that break his law.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. MUR.</speaker>
<line>And that same vengeance doth he hurl on thee</line>
<line>For false forswearing and for murder too.</line>
<line>Thou didst receive the sacrament to fight</line>
<line>In quarrel of the house of Lancaster.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. MUR.</speaker>
<line>And like a traitor to the name of God</line>
<line>Didst break that vow, and with thy treacherous blade</line>
<line>Unrip&#8217;st the bowels of thy sov&#8217;reign&#8217;s son.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. MUR.</speaker>

<line>How canst thou urge God&#8217;s dreadful law to us,</line>
<line>When thou hast broke it in such dear degree?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CLAR.</speaker>
<line>Alas! For whose sake did I that ill deed?</line>
<line>For Edward, for my brother, for his sake.</line>
<line>He sends you not to murder me for this,</line>
<line>For in that sin he is as deep as I.</line>
<line>If God will be avenged for the deed,</line>
<line>O, know you yet he doth it publicly.</line>
<line>Take not the quarrel from his pow&#8217;rful arm;</line>
<line>He needs no indirect or lawless course</line>
<line>To cut off those that have offended him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. MUR.</speaker>
<line>Who made thee then a bloody minister,</line>
<line>When gallant-springing brave Plantagenet,</line>
<line>That princely novice, was struck dead by thee?</line>

<line>My brother&#8217;s love, the devil, and my rage.</line>

<line>Thy brother&#8217;s love, our duty, and thy faults</line>
<line>Provoke us hither now to slaughter thee.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CLAR.</speaker>
<line>O, if you love my brother, hate not me!</line>
<line>I am his brother and I love him well.</line>
<line>If you are hir&#8217;d for meed, go back again,</line>
<line>And I will send you to my brother Gloucester,</line>
<line>Who shall reward you better for my life</line>
<line>Than Edward will for tidings of my death.</line>

<line>You are deceiv&#8217;d, your brother Gloucester hates you.</line>

<line offset="5">Ay, so we will.</line>

<line>Tell him, when that our princely father York</line>
<line>Blest his three sons with his victorious arm,</line>
<line>And charg&#8217;d us from his soul to love each other,)</line>
<line>He little thought of this divided friendship.</line>
<line>Bid Gloucester think of this, and he will weep.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. MUR.</speaker>
<line>Ay, millstones, as he lesson&#8217;d us to weep.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CLAR.</speaker>
<line>O, do not slander him, for he is kind.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. MUR.</speaker>
<line>Right, as snow in harvest. Come, you deceive yourself,</line>
<line>&#8217;Tis he that sends us to destroy you here.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CLAR.</speaker>
<line>It cannot be, for he bewept my fortune,</line>
<line>And hugg&#8217;d me in his arms, and swore with sobs</line>
<line>That he would labor my delivery.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. MUR.</speaker>
<line>Why, so he doth, when he delivers you</line>
<line>From this earth&#8217;s thralldom to the joys of heaven.</line>

<speech>

<line>Make peace with God, for you must die, my lord.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>CLAR.</speaker>
<line>Have you that holy feeling in your souls</line>
<line>To counsel me to make my peace with God,</line>
<line>And are you yet to your own souls so blind</line>
<line>That you will war with God by murd&#8217;ring me?</line>
<line>O, sirs, consider, they that set you on</line>
<line>To do this deed will hate you for the deed.</line>

<line>Would not entreat for life?</line>

<line>Relent? No: &#8217;tis cowardly and womanish.</line>

<line>Who sued to me for him? Who (in my wrath)</line>
<line>Kneel&#8217;d at my feet and bid me be advis&#8217;d?</line>
<line>Who spoke of brotherhood? Who spoke of love?</line>
<line>Who told me how the poor soul did forsake</line>
<line>The mighty Warwick and did fight for me?</line>
<line>Who told me, in the field at Tewksbury,</line>
<line>When Oxford had me down, he rescued me,</line>
<line>And said, &#8220;Dear brother, live, and be a king&#8221;?</line>
<line>Who told me, when we both lay in the field</line>
<line>Frozen (almost) to death, how he did lap me</line>
<line>Even in his own garments, and did give himself</line>
<line>(All thin and naked) to the numb cold night?</line>
<line>All this from my remembrance brutish wrath</line>
<line>Sinfully pluck&#8217;d, and not a man of you</line>
<line>Had so much grace to put it in my mind.</line>
<line>But when your carters or your waiting vassals</line>
<line>Have done a drunken slaughter, and defac&#8217;d</line>

<line>You straight are on your knees for pardon, pardon,</line>
<line>And I (unjustly too) must grant it you.</line>

<stagedir>Stanley rises.</stagedir>
<line>But for my brother not a man would speak,</line>
<line>Nor I (ungracious) speak unto myself</line>
<line>For him, poor soul. The proudest of you all</line>
<line>Have been beholding to him in his life;</line>
<line>Yet none of you would once beg for his life.</line>
<line>O God! I fear thy justice will take hold</line>
<line>On me and you, and mine and yours, for this.</line>
<line>Come, Hastings, help me to my closet. Ah, poor Clarence!</line>

<speech>
<speaker>EDW.</speaker>
<line>Good grandam, tell us, is our father dead?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUCH.</speaker>
<line>No, boy.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MARG.</speaker>
<line>Why do you weep so oft, and beat your breast,</line>
<line>And cry, &#8220;O Clarence, my unhappy son!&#8221;?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>EDW.</speaker>
<line>Why do you look on us, and shake your head,</line>
<line>And call us orphans, wretches, castaways,</line>
<line>If that our noble father were alive?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUCH.</speaker>
<line>My pretty cousins, you mistake me both:</line>
<line>I do lament the sickness of the King,</line>
<line>As loath to lose him, not your father&#8217;s death;</line>
<line>It were lost sorrow to wail one that&#8217;s lost.</line>

<line>Peace, children, peace, the King doth love you well.</line>
<line>Incapable and shallow innocents,</line>
<line>You cannot guess who caus&#8217;d your father&#8217;s death.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>EDW.</speaker>
<line>Grandam, we can; for my good uncle Gloucester</line>
<line>Told me the King, provok&#8217;d to it by the Queen,</line>
<line>Devis&#8217;d impeachments to imprison him;</line>
<line>And when my uncle told me so, he wept,</line>
<line>And pitied me, and kindly kiss&#8217;d my cheek;</line>
<line>Bade me rely on him as on my father,</line>
<line>And he would love me dearly as a child.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUCH.</speaker>
<line>Ah! That deceit should steal such gentle shape,</line>
<line>And with a virtuous visor hide deep vice!</line>
<line>He is my son&#8212;ay, and therein my shame,</line>
<line>Yet from my dugs he drew not this deceit.</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. ELIZ.</speaker>
<line>To make an act of tragic violence.</line>
<line>Edward, my lord, thy son, our king, is dead!</line>
<line>Why grow the branches when the root is gone?</line>
<line>Why wither not the leaves that want their sap?</line>
<line>If you will live, lament; if die, be brief,</line>
<line>That our swift-winged souls may catch the King&#8217;s,</line>
<line>Or like obedient subjects follow him</line>
<line>To his new kingdom of ne&#8217;er-changing night.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUCH.</speaker>
<line>Ah, so much interest have I in thy sorrow</line>
<line>As I had title in thy noble husband!</line>
<line>I have bewept a worthy husband&#8217;s death,</line>
<line>And liv&#8217;d with looking on his images;</line>
<line>But now two mirrors of his princely semblance</line>
<line>Are crack&#8217;d in pieces by malignant death,</line>
<line>And I for comfort have but one false glass,</line>
<line>That grieves me when I see my shame in him.</line>
<line>Thou art a widow; yet thou art a mother,</line>
<line>And hast the comfort of thy children left;</line>
<line>But death hath snatch&#8217;d my husband from mine arms,</line>
<line>And pluck&#8217;d two crutches from my feeble hands,</line>
<line>Clarence and Edward. O, what cause have I</line>
<line>(Thine being but a moi&#8217;ty of my moan)</line>
<line>To overgo thy woes and drown thy cries!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>EDW.</speaker>
<line>Ah, aunt! You wept not for our father&#8217;s death;</line>
<line>How can we aid you with our kindred tears?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MARG.</speaker>
<line>Our fatherless distress was left unmoan&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Your widow-dolor likewise be unwept!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. ELIZ.</speaker>
<line>Give me no help in lamentation,</line>
<line>I am not barren to bring forth complaints.</line>
<line>All springs reduce their currents to mine eyes,</line>
<line>That I being govern&#8217;d by the watery moon,</line>
<line>May send forth plenteous tears to drown the world!</line>
<line>Ah for my husband, for my dear Lord Edward!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CHIL.</speaker>
<line>Ah for our father, for our dear Lord Clarence!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUCH.</speaker>
<line>Alas for both, both mine, Edward and Clarence!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. ELIZ.</speaker>
<line>What stay had I but Edward? And he&#8217;s gone.</line>
</speech>

<line>What stay had we but Clarence? And he&#8217;s gone.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. ELIZ.</speaker>
<line>Was never widow had so dear a loss.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CHIL.</speaker>
<line>Were never orphans had so dear a loss.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUCH.</speaker>
<line>Was never mother had so dear a loss.</line>
<line>Alas! I am the mother of these griefs:</line>
<line>Their woes are parcell&#8217;d, mine is general.</line>
<line>She for an Edward weeps, and so do I;</line>
<line>I for a Clarence weep, so doth not she;</line>
<line>These babes for Clarence weep, and so do I;</line>
<line>I for an Edward weep, so do not they.</line>
<line>Alas! You three on me, threefold distress&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Pour all your tears. I am your sorrow&#8217;s nurse,</line>
<line>And I will pamper it with lamentation.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DOR.</speaker>
<line>Comfort, dear mother, God is much displeas&#8217;d</line>
<line>That you take with unthankfulness his doing.</line>
<line>In common worldly things &#8217;tis call&#8217;d ungrateful</line>
<line>With dull unwillingness to repay a debt,</line>
<line>Which with a bounteous hand was kindly lent;</line>
<line>Much more to be thus opposite with heaven,</line>
<line>For it requires the royal debt it lent you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>RIV.</speaker>
<line>Madam, bethink you like a careful mother</line>
<line>Of the young Prince your son. Send straight for him,</line>
<line>Let him be crown&#8217;d, in him your comfort lives.</line>
<line>Drown desperate sorrow in dead Edward&#8217;s grave,</line>

<line>Sister, have comfort. All of us have cause</line>
<line>To wail the dimming of our shining star;</line>
<line>But none can help our harms by wailing them.</line>
<line>Madam, my mother, I do cry you mercy,</line>
<line>I did not see your Grace. Humbly on my knee</line>
<line>I crave your blessing.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUCH.</speaker>
<line>God bless thee, and put meekness in thy breast,</line>

<line>Amen!&#8212;</line>
<stagedir>Aside.</stagedir>
<line offset="2">And make me die a good old man!</line>
<line>That is the butt-end of a mother&#8217;s blessing.</line>
<line>I marvel that her Grace did leave it out.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BUCK.</speaker>
<line>You cloudy princes and heart-sorrowing peers</line>
<line>That bear this heavy mutual load of moan,</line>
<line>Now cheer each other in each other&#8217;s love.</line>
<line>Though we have spent our harvest of this king,</line>
<line>We are to reap the harvest of his son.</line>
<line>The broken rancor of your high-swoll&#8217;n hates,</line>
<line>But lately splinter&#8217;d, knit, and join&#8217;d together,</line>
<line>Must gently be preserv&#8217;d, cherish&#8217;d, and kept.</line>
<line>Me seemeth good that, with some little train,</line>
<line>Forthwith from Ludlow the young Prince be fet</line>
<line>Hither to London, to be crown&#8217;d our king.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>RIV.</speaker>
<line>Why with some little train, my Lord of Buckingham?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BUCK.</speaker>
<line>Marry, my lord, lest by a multitude</line>
<line>The new-heal&#8217;d wound of malice should break out,</line>
<line>Which would be so much the more dangerous,</line>
<line>By how much the estate is green and yet ungovern&#8217;d.</line>
<line>Where every horse bears his commanding rein</line>
<line>And may direct his course as please himself,</line>
<line>As well the fear of harm, as harm apparent,</line>
<line>In my opinion, ought to be prevented.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>I hope the King made peace with all of us,</line>
<line>And the compact is firm and true in me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>RIV.</speaker>
<line>And so in me, and so (I think) in all.</line>
<line>Yet since it is but green, it should be put</line>
<line>To no apparent likelihood of breach,</line>
<line>Which haply by much company might be urg&#8217;d;</line>
<line>Therefore I say with noble Buckingham,</line>
<line>That it is meet so few should fetch the Prince.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HAST.</speaker>
<line>And so say I.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>Then be it so, and go we to determine</line>
<line>Who they shall be that straight shall post to Ludlow.</line>
<line>Madam, and you, my sister, will you go</line>
<line>To give your censures in this business?</line>
</speech>

<speech>

<line>With all our hearts.</line>

<stagedir>Exeunt. Manent Buckingham and Richard.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>BUCK.</speaker>
<line>My lord, whoever journeys to the Prince,</line>
<line>For God sake let not us two stay at home;</line>
<line>For by the way, I&#8217;ll sort occasion,</line>
<line>As index to the story we late talk&#8217;d of,</line>
<line>To part the Queen&#8217;s proud kindred from the Prince.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>My other self, my counsel&#8217;s consistory,</line>
<line>My oracle, my prophet, my dear cousin,</line>
<line>I, as a child, will go by thy direction.</line>

<line>No doubt shall then, and till then, govern well.</line>
</speech>

<line>So stood the state when Henry the Sixth</line>
<line>Was crown&#8217;d in Paris but at nine months old.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>3. CIT.</speaker>
<line>Stood the state so? No, no, good friends, God wot,</line>
<line>For then this land was famously enrich&#8217;d</line>
<line>With politic grave counsel; then the King</line>
<line>Had virtuous uncles to protect his Grace.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. CIT.</speaker>
<line>Why, so hath this, both by his father and mother.</line>
</speech>

<line>Better it were they all came by his father,</line>

<line>O, full of danger is the Duke of Gloucester,</line>

<line>When great leaves fall, then winter is at hand;</line>

<line>Before the days of change, still is it so.</line>

<line>I long with all my heart to see the Prince.</line>
<line>I hope he is much grown since last I saw him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. ELIZ.</speaker>
<line>But I hear no; they say my son of York</line>
<line>Has almost overta&#8217;en him in his growth.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>YORK.</speaker>
<line>Ay, mother, but I would not have it so.</line>

<speech>

<line>Why, my good cousin, it is good to grow.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>YORK.</speaker>
<line>Grandam, one night as we did sit at supper,</line>
<line>My uncle Rivers talk&#8217;d how I did grow</line>

<line>&#8220;Small herbs have grace, great weeds do grow apace.&#8221;</line>
<line>And since, methinks I would not grow so fast,</line>
<line>Because sweet flow&#8217;rs are slow and weeds make haste.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUCH.</speaker>
<line>Good faith, good faith, the saying did not hold</line>
<line>In him that did object the same to thee:</line>
<line>He was the wretched&#8217;st thing when he was young,</line>
<line>So long a-growing and so leisurely</line>

<line>Now by my troth, if I had been rememb&#8217;red,</line>

<line>Welcome, dear cousin, my thoughts&#8217; sovereign,</line>
<line>The weary way hath made you melancholy.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>PRINCE.</speaker>
<line>No, uncle, but our crosses on the way</line>
<line>Have made it tedious, wearisome, and heavy.</line>
<line>I want more uncles here to welcome me.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>Sweet Prince, the untainted virtue of your years</line>
<line>Hath not yet div&#8217;d into the world&#8217;s deceit;</line>
<line>Nor more can you distinguish of a man</line>
<line>Than of his outward show, which, God he knows,</line>
<line>Seldom or never jumpeth with the heart.</line>
<line>Those uncles which you want were dangerous;</line>
<line>Your Grace attended to their sug&#8217;red words,</line>
<line>But look&#8217;d not on the poison of their hearts.</line>
<line>God keep you from them, and from such false friends!</line>

<line>God keep me from false friends!&#8212;but they were none.</line>

<speaker>PRINCE.</speaker>
<line>Welcome, my lord. What, will our mother come?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HAST.</speaker>
<line>On what occasion, God he knows, not I,</line>
<line>The Queen your mother and your brother York</line>
<line>Have taken sanctuary. The tender Prince</line>
<line>Would fain have come with me to meet your Grace,</line>
<line>But by his mother was perforce withheld.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BUCK.</speaker>
<line>Fie, what an indirect and peevish course</line>
<line>Is this of hers! Lord Cardinal, will your Grace</line>
<line>Persuade the Queen to send the Duke of York</line>
<line>Unto his princely brother presently?</line>
<line>If she deny, Lord Hastings, go with him,</line>
<line>And from her jealous arms pluck him perforce.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CARD.</speaker>
<line>My Lord of Buckingham, if my weak oratory</line>
<line>Can from his mother win the Duke of York,</line>
<line>Anon expect him here; but if she be obdurate</line>
<line>To mild entreaties, God in heaven forbid</line>
<line>We should infringe the holy privilege</line>
<line>Of blessed sanctuary! Not for all this land</line>
<line>Would I be guilty of so deep a sin.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BUCK.</speaker>
<line>You are too senseless-obstinate, my lord,</line>
<line>Too ceremonious and traditional.</line>
<line>Weigh it but with the grossness of this age,</line>
<line>You break not sanctuary in seizing him.</line>
<line>The benefit thereof is always granted</line>
<line>To those whose dealings have deserv&#8217;d the place</line>
<line>And those who have the wit to claim the place.</line>
<line>This prince hath neither claim&#8217;d it nor deserv&#8217;d it,</line>
<line>And therefore, in mine opinion, cannot have it.</line>
<line>Then taking him from thence that is not there,</line>
<line>You break no privilege nor charter there.</line>
<line>Oft have I heard of sanctuary men,</line>
<line>But sanctuary children never till now.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CARD.</speaker>
<line>My lord, you shall overrule my mind for once.</line>
<line>Come on, Lord Hastings, will you go with me?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HAST.</speaker>
<line>I go, my lord.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRINCE.</speaker>
<line>Good lords, make all the speedy haste you may.</line>

<stagedir>Exeunt Cardinal and Hastings.</stagedir>
<line>Say, uncle Gloucester, if our brother come,</line>
<line>Where shall we sojourn till our coronation?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>Where it seems best unto your royal self.</line>
<line>If I may counsel you, some day or two</line>
<line>Your Highness shall repose you at the Tower;</line>
<line>Then where you please, and shall be thought most fit</line>
<line>For your best health and recreation.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRINCE.</speaker>
<line>I do not like the Tower, of any place.</line>
<line>Did Julius Caesar build that place, my lord?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BUCK.</speaker>
<line>He did, my gracious lord, begin that place,</line>
<line>Which, since, succeeding ages have re-edified.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRINCE.</speaker>
<line>Is it upon record, or else reported</line>
<line>Successively from age to age, he built it?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BUCK.</speaker>
<line>Upon record, my gracious lord.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRINCE.</speaker>
<line>But say, my lord, it were not regist&#8217;red,</line>
<line>Methinks the truth should live from age to age,</line>
<line>As &#8217;twere retail&#8217;d to all posterity,</line>
<line>Even to the general all-ending day.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<stagedir>Aside.</stagedir>
<line>So wise so young, they say do never live long.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRINCE.</speaker>
<line>What say you, uncle?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>I say, without characters fame lives long.</line>
<stagedir>Aside.</stagedir>
<line>Thus, like the formal Vice, Iniquity,</line>
<line>I moralize two meanings in one word.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRINCE.</speaker>
<line>That Julius Caesar was a famous man;</line>
<line>With what his valor did enrich his wit,</line>
<line>His wit set down to make his valure live.</line>
<line>Death makes no conquest of this conqueror,</line>
<line>For now he lives in fame though not in life.</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll tell you what, my cousin Buckingham&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BUCK.</speaker>
<line>What, my gracious lord?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRINCE.</speaker>
<line>And if I live until I be a man,</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll win our ancient right in France again,</line>
<line>Or die a soldier as I liv&#8217;d a king.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<stagedir>Aside.</stagedir>
<line>Short summers lightly have a forward spring.</line>

<stagedir>Enter young York, Hastings, Cardinal Bourchier.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>BUCK.</speaker>
<line>Now in good time, here comes the Duke of York.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRINCE.</speaker>
<line>Richard of York, how fares our loving brother?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>YORK.</speaker>
<line>Well, my dread lord&#8212;so must I call you now.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRINCE.</speaker>
<line>Ay, brother, to our grief, as it is yours.</line>
<line>Too late he died that might have kept that title,</line>
<line>Which by his death hath lost much majesty.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>How fares our cousin, noble Lord of York?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>YORK.</speaker>
<line>I thank you, gentle uncle. O my lord,</line>
<line>You said that idle weeds are fast in growth:</line>
<line>The Prince my brother hath outgrown me far.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>He hath, my lord.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>YORK.</speaker>
<line>And therefore is he idle?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>O my fair cousin, I must not say so.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>YORK.</speaker>
<line>Then he is more beholding to you than I.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>He may command me as my sovereign,</line>
<line>But you have power in me as in a kinsman.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>YORK.</speaker>
<line>I pray you, uncle, give me this dagger.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>My dagger, little cousin? With all my heart.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRINCE.</speaker>
<line>A beggar, brother?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>YORK.</speaker>
<line>Of my kind uncle, that I know will give,</line>
<line>And being but a toy, which is no grief to give.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>A greater gift than that I&#8217;ll give my cousin.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>YORK.</speaker>
<line>A greater gift? O, that&#8217;s the sword to it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>Ay, gentle cousin, were it light enough.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>YORK.</speaker>
<line>O then I see you will part but with light gifts!</line>
<line>In weightier things You&#8217;ll say a beggar nay.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>It is too heavy for your Grace to wear.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>YORK.</speaker>
<line>I weigh it lightly, were it heavier.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>What, would you have my weapon, little lord?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>YORK.</speaker>
<line>I would, that I might thank you as you call me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>How?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>YORK.</speaker>
<line>Little.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRINCE.</speaker>
<line>My Lord of York will still be cross in talk.</line>
<line>Uncle, your Grace knows how to bear with him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>YORK.</speaker>
<line>You mean, to bear me, not to bear with me.</line>
<line>Uncle, my brother mocks both you and me:</line>
<line>Because that I am little, like an ape,</line>
<line>He thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BUCK.</speaker>
<stagedir>Aside to Hastings.</stagedir>
<line>With what a sharp-provided wit he reasons!</line>
<line>To mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle,</line>
<line>He prettily and aptly taunts himself:</line>
<line>So cunning and so young is wonderful.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>My lord, will&#8217;t please you pass along?</line>
<line>Myself and my good cousin Buckingham</line>
<line>Will to your mother, to entreat of her</line>
<line>To meet you at the Tower and welcome you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>YORK.</speaker>
<line>What, will you go unto the Tower, my lord?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRINCE.</speaker>
<line>My Lord Protector needs will have it so.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>YORK.</speaker>
<line>I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>Why, what should you fear?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>YORK.</speaker>
<line>Marry, my uncle Clarence&#8217; angry ghost.</line>
<line>My grandam told me he was murd&#8217;red there.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRINCE.</speaker>
<line>I fear no uncles dead.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>Nor none that live, I hope.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRINCE.</speaker>
<line>And if they live, I hope I need not feat.</line>
<line>But come, my lord; with a heavy heart,</line>
<line>Thinking on them, go I unto the Tower.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>A sennet. Exeunt Prince Edward, York, Hastings, Cardinal Bourchier, and others. Manent Richard, Buckingham, and Catesby.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>BUCK.</speaker>
<line>Think you, my lord, this little prating York</line>
<line>Was not incensed by his subtile mother</line>
<line>To taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>No doubt, no doubt. O, &#8217;tis a perilous boy,</line>
<line>Bold, quick, ingenious, forward, capable:</line>
<line>He is all the mother&#8217;s, from the top to toe.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BUCK.</speaker>
<line>Well, let them rest. Come hither, Catesby.</line>
<line>Thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intend</line>
<line>As closely to conceal what we impart.</line>
<line>Thou know&#8217;st our reasons urg&#8217;d upon the way;</line>
<line>What think&#8217;st thou? Is it not an easy matter</line>
<line>To make William Lord Hastings of our mind</line>
<line>For the installment of this noble Duke</line>
<line>In the seat royal of this famous isle?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CATE.</speaker>
<line>He for his father&#8217;s sake so loves the Prince</line>
<line>That he will not be won to aught against him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BUCK.</speaker>
<line>What think&#8217;st thou then of Stanley? Will not he?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CATE.</speaker>
<line>He will do all in all as Hastings doth.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BUCK.</speaker>
<line>Well then, no more but this: go, gentle Catesby,</line>
<line>And as it were far off, sound thou Lord Hastings</line>
<line>How he doth stand affected to our purpose,</line>
<line>And summon him tomorrow to the Tower</line>
<line>To sit about the coronation.</line>
<line>If thou dost find him tractable to us,</line>
<line>Encourage him, and tell him all our reasons;</line>
<line>If he be leaden, icy, cold, unwilling,</line>
<line>Be thou so too, and so break off the talk,</line>
<line>And give us notice of his inclination;</line>
<line>For we tomorrow hold divided Councils,</line>
<line>Wherein thyself shalt highly be employ&#8217;d.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>Commend me to Lord William. Tell him, Catesby,</line>
<line>His ancient knot of dangerous adversaries</line>
<line>Tomorrow are let blood at Pomfret Castle,</line>
<line>And bid my lord, for joy of this good news,</line>
<line>Give Mistress Shore one gentle kiss the more.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BUCK.</speaker>
<line>Good Catesby, go effect this business soundly.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CATE.</speaker>
<line>My good lords both, with all the heed I can.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>Shall we hear from you, Catesby, ere we sleep?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CATE.</speaker>
<line>You shall, my lord.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>At Crosby House, there shall you find us both.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit Catesby.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>BUCK.</speaker>
<line>Now, my lord, what shall we do if we perceive</line>
<line>Lord Hastings will not yield to our complots?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>Chop off his head! Something we will determine.</line>
<line>And look when I am king, claim thou of me</line>
<line>The earldom of Herford, and all the moveables</line>
<line>Whereof the King my brother was possess&#8217;d.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BUCK.</speaker>
<line>I&#8217;ll claim that promise at your Grace&#8217;s hand.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>And look to have it yielded with all kindness.</line>
<line>Come, let us sup betimes, that afterwards</line>
<line>We may digest our complots in some form.</line>

<stagedir>Enter a Messenger to the door of Hastings.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>STAN. MESS.</speaker>
<line>My lord! My lord!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HAST.</speaker>
<stagedir>Within.</stagedir>
<line>Who knocks?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>STAN. MESS.</speaker>
<line>One from the Lord Stanley.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HAST.</speaker>
<stagedir>Within.</stagedir>
<line>What is&#8217;t a&#8217; clock?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>STAN. MESS.</speaker>
<line>Upon the stroke of four.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Lord Hastings.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>HAST.</speaker>
<line>Cannot my Lord Stanley sleep these tedious nights?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>STAN. MESS.</speaker>
<line>So it appears by that I have to say:</line>
<line>First, he commends him to your noble self.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HAST.</speaker>
<line>What then?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>STAN. MESS.</speaker>
<line>Then certifies your lordship that this night</line>
<line>He dreamt the boar had rased off his helm.</line>
<line>Besides, he says there are two Councils kept;</line>
<line>And that may be determin&#8217;d at the one</line>
<line>Which may make you and him to rue at th&#8217; other.</line>
<line>Therefore he sends to know your lordship&#8217;s pleasure,</line>
<line>If you will presently take horse with him,</line>
<line>And with all speed post with him toward the north,</line>
<line>To shun the danger that his soul divines.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HAST.</speaker>
<line>Go, fellow, go, return unto thy lord,</line>
<line>Bid him not fear the separated Council:</line>
<line>His honor and myself are at the one,</line>
<line>And at the other is my good friend Catesby;</line>
<line>Where nothing can proceed that toucheth us</line>
<line>Whereof I shall not have intelligence.</line>
<line>Tell him his fears are shallow, without instance;</line>
<line>And for his dreams, I wonder he&#8217;s so simple</line>
<line>To trust the mock&#8217;ry of unquiet slumbers.</line>
<line>To fly the boar before the boar pursues</line>
<line>Were to incense the boar to follow us,</line>
<line>And make pursuit where he did mean no chase.</line>
<line>Go, bid thy master rise and come to me,</line>
<line>And we will both together to the Tower,</line>
<line>Where he shall see the boar will use us kindly.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>STAN. MESS.</speaker>
<line>I&#8217;ll go, my lord, and tell him what you say.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit.</stagedir>

<stagedir>Enter Catesby.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>CATE.</speaker>
<line>Many good morrows to my noble lord!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HAST.</speaker>
<line>Good morrow, Catesby, you are early stirring.</line>
<line>What news, what news, in this our tott&#8217;ring state?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CATE.</speaker>
<line>It is a reeling world indeed, my lord,</line>
<line>And I believe will never stand upright</line>
<line>Till Richard wear the garland of the realm.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HAST.</speaker>
<line>How? Wear the garland? Dost thou mean the crown?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CATE.</speaker>
<line>Ay, my good lord.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HAST.</speaker>
<line>I&#8217;ll have this crown of mine cut from my shoulders</line>
<line>Before I&#8217;ll see the crown so foul misplac&#8217;d.</line>
<line>But canst thou guess that he doth aim at it?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CATE.</speaker>
<line>Ay, on my life, and hopes to find you forward</line>
<line>Upon his party for the gain thereof;</line>
<line>And thereupon he sends you this good news,</line>
<line>That this same very day your enemies,</line>
<line>The kindred of the Queen, must die at Pomfret.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HAST.</speaker>
<line>Indeed I am no mourner for that news,</line>
<line>Because they have been still my adversaries;</line>
<line>But that I&#8217;ll give my voice on Richard&#8217;s side</line>
<line>To bar my master&#8217;s heirs in true descent,</line>
<line>God knows I will not do it, to the death!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CATE.</speaker>
<line>God keep your lordship in that gracious mind!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HAST.</speaker>
<line>But I shall laugh at this a twelvemonth hence,</line>
<line>That they which brought me in my master&#8217;s hate,</line>
<line>I live to look upon their tragedy.</line>
<line>Well, Catesby, ere a fortnight make me older,</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll send some packing that yet think not on&#8217;t.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CATE.</speaker>
<line>&#8217;Tis a vile thing to die, my gracious lord,</line>
<line>When men are unprepar&#8217;d and look not for it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HAST.</speaker>
<line>O monstrous, monstrous! And so falls it out</line>
<line>With Rivers, Vaughan, Grey; and so &#8217;twill do</line>
<line>With some men else, that think themselves as safe</line>
<line>As thou and I, who (as thou know&#8217;st) are dear</line>
<line>To princely Richard and to Buckingham.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CATE.</speaker>
<line>The princes both make high account of you&#8212;</line>

<stagedir>Aside.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>HAST.</speaker>
<line>I know they do, and I have well deserv&#8217;d it.</line>

<stagedir>Enter Lord Stanley.</stagedir>
<line>Come on, come on, where is your boar-spear, man?</line>
<line>Fear you the boar, and go so unprovided?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>STAN.</speaker>
<line>My lord, good morrow, good morrow, Catesby.</line>
<line>You may jest on, but, by the holy rood,</line>
<line>I do not like these several Councils, I.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HAST.</speaker>
<line>My lord,</line>
<line>I hold my life as dear as you do yours,</line>
<line>And never in my days, I do protest,</line>
<line>Was it so precious to me as &#8217;tis now.</line>
<line>Think you, but that I know our state secure,</line>
<line>I would be so triumphant as I am?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>STAN.</speaker>
<line>The lords at Pomfret, when they rode from London,</line>
<line>Were jocund, and suppos&#8217;d their states were sure,</line>
<line>And they indeed had no cause to mistrust;</line>
<line>But yet you see how soon the day o&#8217;ercast.</line>
<line>This sudden stab of rancor I misdoubt;</line>
<line>Pray God, I say, I prove a needless coward!</line>
<line>What, shall we toward the Tower? The day is spent.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HAST.</speaker>
<line>Come, come, have with you. Wot you what, my lord?</line>
<line>Today the lords you talk&#8217;d of are beheaded.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>STAN.</speaker>
<line>They, for their truth, might better wear their heads</line>
<line>Than some that have accus&#8217;d them wear their hats.</line>
<line>But come, my lord, let&#8217;s away.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter a Pursuivant, also named Hastings.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>HAST.</speaker>
<line>Go on before, I&#8217;ll talk with this good fellow.</line>

<stagedir>Exeunt Lord Stanley and Catesby.</stagedir>
<line>How now, sirrah? How goes the world with thee?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PURS.</speaker>
<line>The better that your lordship please to ask.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HAST.</speaker>
<line>I tell thee, man, &#8217;tis better with me now</line>
<line>Than when thou met&#8217;st me last where now we meet.</line>
<line>Then was I going prisoner to the Tower,</line>
<line>By the suggestion of the Queen&#8217;s allies;</line>
<line>But now I tell thee (keep it to thyself)</line>
<line>This day those enemies are put to death,</line>
<line>And I in better state than e&#8217;er I was.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PURS.</speaker>
<line>God hold it, to your honor&#8217;s good content!</line>

<line>Your friends at Pomfret, they do need the priest,</line>

<speech>
<speaker>HAST.</speaker>
<line>Good faith, and when I met this holy man</line>
<line>The men you talk of came into my mind.</line>
<line>What, go you toward the Tower?</line>

<speech>

<line>I do, my lord, but long I cannot stay there.</line>

<line>I thank his Grace, I know he loves me well;</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BUCK.</speaker>
<line>Had you not come upon your cue, my lord,</line>
<line>William Lord Hastings had pronounc&#8217;d your part,</line>

<line>My Lord of Ely, when I was last in Holborn,</line>
<line>I saw good strawberries in your garden there.</line>

<line>Catesby hath sounded Hastings in our business,</line>
<line>And finds the testy gentleman so hot</line>

<line>His Grace looks cheerfully and smooth this morning;</line>

<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>Then be your eyes the witness of their evil.</line>
<line>Look how I am bewitch&#8217;d; behold, mine arm</line>

<line>Woe, woe for England, not a whit for me!</line>
<line>For I, too fond, might have prevented this.</line>
<line>Stanley did dream the boar did rase our helms,</line>
<line>And I did scorn it and disdain to fly.</line>
<line>Three times today my foot-cloth horse did scumble,</line>
<line>And started when he look&#8217;d upon the Tower,</line>
<line>As loath to bear me to the slaughter-house.</line>
<line>O now I need the priest that spake to me!</line>
<line>I now repent I told the pursuivant,</line>
<line>As too triumphing, how mine enemies</line>
<line>Today at Pomfret bloodily were butcher&#8217;d,</line>
<line>And I myself secure, in grace and favor.</line>
<line>O Margaret, Margaret, now thy heavy curse</line>

<line>Lives like a drunken sailor on a mast,</line>
<line>Ready with every nod to tumble down</line>

<line>Come, come, dispatch, &#8217;tis bootless to exclaim.</line>

<line>I prophesy the fearfull&#8217;st time to thee</line>

<line>So dear I lov&#8217;d the man that I must weep.</line>
<line>I took him for the plainest harmless creature</line>
<line>That breath&#8217;d upon the earth a Christian;</line>
<line>Made him my book, wherein my soul recorded</line>
<line>The history of all her secret thoughts.</line>
<line>So smooth he daub&#8217;d his vice with show of virtue</line>
<line>That, his apparent open guilt omitted&#8212;</line>
<line>I mean, his conversation with Shore&#8217;s wife&#8212;</line>
<line>He liv&#8217;d from all attainder of suspects.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BUCK.</speaker>
<line>Well, well, he was the covert&#8217;st shelt&#8217;red traitor</line>
<line>That ever liv&#8217;d. Look ye, my Lord Mayor,</line>
<line>Would you imagine, or almost believe,</line>
<line>Were&#8217;t not that by great preservation</line>
<line>We live to tell it, that the subtile traitor</line>
<line>This day had plotted, in the Council-house,</line>
<line>To murder me and my good Lord of Gloucester?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MAY.</speaker>
<line>Had he done so?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>What? Think you we are Turks or infidels?</line>
<line>Or that we would, against the form of law,</line>
<line>Proceed thus rashly in the villain&#8217;s death,</line>
<line>But that the extreme peril of the case,</line>
<line>The peace of England, and our persons&#8217; safety,</line>
<line>Enforc&#8217;d us to this execution?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MAY.</speaker>
<line>Now fair befall you! He deserv&#8217;d his death,</line>
<line>And your good Graces both have well proceeded,</line>
<line>To warn false traitors from the like attempts.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BUCK.</speaker>
<line>I never look&#8217;d for better at his hands</line>
<line>After he once fell in with Mistress Shore.</line>
<line>Yet had we not determin&#8217;d he should die</line>
<line>Until your lordship came to see his end,</line>
<line>Which now the loving haste of these our friends,</line>
<line>Something against our meanings, have prevented;</line>
<line>Because, my lord, I would have had you heard</line>
<line>The traitor speak, and timorously confess</line>
<line>The manner and the purpose of his treasons,</line>
<line>That you might well have signified the same</line>
<line>Unto the citizens, who haply may</line>
<line>Misconster us in him and wail his death.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MAY.</speaker>
<line>But, my good lord, your Grace&#8217;s words shall serve</line>
<line>As well as I had seen, and heard him speak;</line>
<line>And do not doubt, right noble princes both,</line>
<line>That I&#8217;ll acquaint our duteous citizens</line>
<line>With all your just proceedings in this cause.</line>

<line>Tell them how Edward put to death a citizen</line>
<line>Only for saying he would make his son</line>
<line>Heir to the Crown&#8212;meaning indeed his house,</line>
<line>Which by the sign thereof was termed so.</line>
<line>Moreover, urge his hateful luxury</line>
<line>And bestial appetite in change of lust,</line>
<line>Which stretch&#8217;d unto their servants, daughters, wives,</line>
<line>Even where his raging eye or savage heart,</line>
<line>Without control, lusted to make a prey.</line>
<line>Nay, for a need, thus far come near my person:</line>
<line>Tell them, when that my mother went with child</line>
<line>Of that insatiate Edward, noble York,</line>
<line>My princely father, then had wars in France,</line>
<line>And by true computation of the time,</line>
<line>Found that the issue was not his begot;</line>
<line>Which well appeared in his lineaments,</line>
<line>Being nothing like the noble Duke my father.</line>

<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>Touch&#8217;d you the bastardy of Edward&#8217;s children?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BUCK.</speaker>
<line>I did, with his contract with Lady Lucy,</line>
<line>And his contract by deputy in France,</line>
<line>Th&#8217; unsatiate greediness of his desire,</line>
<line>And his enforcement of the city wives,</line>
<line>His tyranny for trifles, his own bastardy,</line>
<line>As being got, your father then in France,</line>
<line>And his resemblance, being not like the Duke.</line>
<line>Withal I did infer your lineaments,</line>
<line>Being the right idea of your father,</line>
<line>Both in your form and nobleness of mind;</line>
<line>Laid open all your victories in Scotland,</line>
<line>Your discipline in war, wisdom in peace,</line>
<line>Your bounty, virtue, fair humility;</line>
<line>Indeed, left nothing fitting for your purpose</line>
<line>Untouch&#8217;d or slightly handled in discourse.</line>
<line>And when mine oratory drew to an end,</line>
<line>I bid them that did love their country&#8217;s good</line>
<line>Cry, &#8220;God save Richard, England&#8217;s royal king!&#8221;</line>
</speech>

<line>No, so God help me, they spake not a word,</line>
<line>But like dumb statu&#235;s, or breathing stones,</line>
<line>Star&#8217;d each on other, and look&#8217;d deadly pale;</line>
<line>Which when I saw, I reprehended them,</line>
<line>And ask&#8217;d the Mayor what meant this willful silence.</line>
<line>His answer was, the people were not used</line>
<line>To be spoke to but by the Recorder.</line>
<line>Then he was urg&#8217;d to tell my tale again:</line>
<line>&#8220;Thus saith the Duke, thus hath the Duke inferr&#8217;d&#8221;&#8212;</line>
<line>But nothing spake in warrant from himself.</line>
<line>When he had done, some followers of mine own,</line>
<line>At lower end of the hall, hurl&#8217;d up their caps,</line>
<line>And some ten voices cried, &#8220;God save King Richard!&#8221;</line>
<line>And thus I took the vantage of those few:</line>
<line>&#8220;Thanks, gentle citizens and friends,&#8221; quoth I,</line>

<line>Argues your wisdoms and your love to Richard&#8221;&#8212;</line>

<line>Now, Catesby, what says your lord to my request?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CATE.</speaker>
<line>He doth entreat your Grace, my noble lord,</line>
<line>To visit him tomorrow or next day.</line>
<line>He is within, with two right reverend fathers,</line>
<line>Divinely bent to meditation,</line>
<line>And in no worldly suits would he be mov&#8217;d,</line>
<line>To draw him from his holy exercise.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BUCK.</speaker>
<line>Return, good Catesby, to the gracious Duke,</line>
<line>Tell him, myself, the Mayor and Aldermen,</line>
<line>In deep designs, in matter of great moment,</line>
<line>No less importing than our general good,</line>
<line>Are come to have some conference with his Grace.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CATE.</speaker>
<line>I&#8217;ll signify so much unto him straight.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>BUCK.</speaker>
<line>Ah ha, my lord, this prince is not an Edward!</line>
<line>He is not lulling on a lewd love-bed,</line>
<line>But on his knees at meditation;</line>
<line>Not dallying with a brace of courtezans,</line>
<line>But meditating with two deep divines;</line>
<line>Not sleeping, to engross his idle body,</line>
<line>But praying, to enrich his watchful soul.</line>
<line>Happy were England, would this virtuous prince</line>
<line>Take on his Grace the sovereignty thereof,</line>
<line>But sure I fear we shall not win him to it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MAY.</speaker>
<line>Marry, God defend his Grace should say us nay!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BUCK.</speaker>
<line>I fear he will. Here Catesby comes again.</line>

<stagedir>Enter Catesby.</stagedir>
<line>Now, Catesby, what says his Grace?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CATE.</speaker>
<line>My lord,</line>
<line>He wonders to what end you have assembled</line>
<line>Such troops of citizens to come to him,</line>
<line>His Grace not being warn&#8217;d thereof before:</line>
<line>He fears, my lord, you mean no good to him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BUCK.</speaker>
<line>Sorry I am my noble cousin should</line>
<line>Suspect me that I mean no good to him.</line>
<line>By heaven, we come to him in perfit love,</line>
<line>And so once more return and tell his Grace.</line>

<stagedir>Exit Catesby.</stagedir>
<line>When holy and devout religious men</line>
<line>Are at their beads, &#8217;tis much to draw them thence,</line>
<line>So sweet is zealous contemplation.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Richard of Gloucester aloft, between two Bishops. Catesby returns.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>MAY.</speaker>
<line>See where his Grace stands, &#8217;tween two clergymen!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BUCK.</speaker>
<line>Two props of virtue for a Christian prince,</line>
<line>To stay him from the fall of vanity;</line>
<line>And see, a book of prayer in his hand&#8212;</line>
<line>True ornaments to know a holy man.</line>
<line>Famous Plantagenet, most gracious prince,</line>
<line>Lend favorable ear to our requests,</line>
<line>And pardon us the interruption</line>
<line>Of thy devotion and right Christian zeal.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>My lord, there needs no such apology.</line>
<line>I do beseech your Grace to pardon me,</line>
<line>Who, earnest in the service of my God,</line>
<line>Deferr&#8217;d the visitation of my friends.</line>
<line>But leaving this, what is your Grace&#8217;s pleasure?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BUCK.</speaker>
<line>Even that (I hope) which pleaseth God above</line>
<line>And all good men of this ungovern&#8217;d isle.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>I do suspect I have done some offense</line>
<line>That seems disgracious in the city&#8217;s eye,</line>
<line>And that you come to reprehend my ignorance.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BUCK.</speaker>
<line>You have, my lord. Would it might please your Grace,</line>
<line>On our entreaties, to amend your fault!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>Else wherefore breathe I in a Christian land?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BUCK.</speaker>
<line>Know then, it is your fault that you resign</line>
<line>The supreme seat, the throne majestical,</line>
<line>The sceptred office of your ancestors,</line>
<line>Your state of fortune, and your due of birth,</line>
<line>The lineal glory of your royal house,</line>
<line>To the corruption of a blemish&#8217;d stock;</line>
<line>Whiles in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts,</line>
<line>Which here we waken to our country&#8217;s good,</line>
<line>The noble isle doth want her proper limbs;</line>
<line>Her face defac&#8217;d with scars of infamy,</line>
<line>Her royal stock graft with ignoble plants,</line>
<line>And almost should&#8217;red in the swallowing gulf</line>
<line>Of dark forgetfulness and deep oblivion.</line>
<line>Which to recure, we heartily solicit</line>
<line>Your gracious self to take on you the charge</line>
<line>And kingly government of this your land:</line>
<line>Not as protector, steward, substitute,</line>
<line>Or lowly factor for another&#8217;s gain;</line>
<line>But as successively, from blood to blood,</line>
<line>Your right of birth, your empery, your own.</line>
<line>For this, consorted with the citizens,</line>
<line>Your very worshipful and loving friends,</line>
<line>And by their vehement instigation,</line>
<line>In this just cause come I to move your Grace.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>I cannot tell if to depart in silence,</line>
<line>Or bitterly to speak in your reproof,</line>
<line>Best fitteth my degree or your condition.</line>
<line>If not to answer, you might haply think</line>
<line>Tongue-tied ambition, not replying, yielded</line>
<line>To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty,</line>
<line>Which fondly you would here impose on me.</line>
<line>If to reprove you for this suit of yours,</line>
<line>So season&#8217;d with your faithful love to me,</line>
<line>Then on the other side, I check&#8217;d my friends.</line>
<line>Therefore&#8212;to speak, and to avoid the first,</line>
<line>And then, in speaking, not to incur the last&#8212;</line>
<line>Definitively thus I answer you:</line>
<line>Your love deserves my thanks, but my desert</line>
<line>Unmeritable shuns your high request.</line>
<line>First, if all obstacles were cut away,</line>
<line>And that my path were even to the crown,</line>
<line>As the ripe revenue and due of birth,</line>
<line>Yet so much is my poverty of spirit,</line>
<line>So mighty and so many my defects,</line>
<line>That I would rather hide me from my greatness&#8212;</line>
<line>Being a bark to brook no mighty sea&#8212;</line>
<line>Than in my greatness covet to be hid</line>
<line>And in the vapor of my glory smother&#8217;d.</line>
<line>But God be thank&#8217;d, there is no need of me,</line>
<line>And much I need to help you, were there need:</line>
<line>The royal tree hath left us royal fruit,</line>
<line>Which mellow&#8217;d by the stealing hours of time,</line>
<line>Will well become the seat of majesty,</line>
<line>And make (no doubt) us happy by his reign.</line>
<line>On him I lay that you would lay on me,</line>
<line>The right and fortune of his happy stars,</line>
<line>Which God defend that I should wring from him!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BUCK.</speaker>
<line>My lord, this argues conscience in your Grace,</line>
<line>But the respects thereof are nice and trivial,</line>
<line>All circumstances well considered.</line>
<line>You say that Edward is your brother&#8217;s son:</line>
<line>So say we too, but not by Edward&#8217;s wife;</line>
<line>For first was he contract to Lady Lucy&#8212;</line>
<line>Your mother lives a witness to his vow&#8212;</line>
<line>And afterward by substitute betroth&#8217;d</line>
<line>To Bona, sister to the King of France.</line>
<line>These both put off, a poor petitioner,</line>
<line>A care-craz&#8217;d mother to a many sons,</line>
<line>A beauty-waning and distressed widow,</line>
<line>Even in the afternoon of her best days,</line>
<line>Made prize and purchase of his wanton eye,</line>
<line>Seduc&#8217;d the pitch and height of his degree</line>
<line>To base declension and loath&#8217;d bigamy.</line>
<line>By her, in his unlawful bed, he got</line>
<line>This Edward, whom our manners call the Prince.</line>
<line>More bitterly could I expostulate,</line>
<line>Save that for reverence to some alive,</line>
<line>I give a sparing limit to my tongue.</line>
<line>Then, good my lord, take to your royal self</line>
<line>This proffer&#8217;d benefit of dignity;</line>
<line>If not to bless us and the land withal,</line>
<line>Yet to draw forth your noble ancestry</line>
<line>From the corruption of abusing times</line>
<line>Unto a lineal true-derived course.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MAY.</speaker>
<line>Do, good my lord, your citizens entreat you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BUCK.</speaker>
<line>Refuse not, mighty lord, this proffer&#8217;d love.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CATE.</speaker>
<line>O, make them joyful, grant their lawful suit!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>Alas, why would you heap this care on me?</line>
<line>I am unfit for state and majesty.</line>
<line>I do beseech you take it not amiss,</line>
<line>I cannot nor I will not yield to you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BUCK.</speaker>
<line>If you refuse it&#8212;as, in love and zeal,</line>
<line>Loath to depose the child, your brother&#8217;s son;</line>
<line>As well we know your tenderness of heart</line>
<line>And gentle, kind, effeminate remorse,</line>
<line>Which we have noted in you to your kindred</line>
<line>And egally indeed to all estates&#8212;</line>
<line>Yet know, whe&#8217;er you accept our suit or no,</line>
<line>Your brother&#8217;s son shall never reign our king,</line>
<line>But we will plant some other in the throne,</line>
<line>To the disgrace and downfall of your house;</line>
<line>And in this resolution here we leave you.</line>
<line>Come, citizens. &#8217;Zounds, I&#8217;ll entreat no more.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>O, do not swear, my Lord of Buckingham.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exeunt Buckingham, Mayor, Aldermen, and Citizens.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>CATE.</speaker>
<line>Call him again, sweet prince, accept their suit.</line>
<line>If you deny them, all the land will rue it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>Will you enforce me to a world of cares?</line>
<line>Call them again, I am not made of stones,</line>
<line>But penetrable to your kind entreaties,</line>
<line>Albeit against my conscience and my soul.</line>

<stagedir>Enter Buckingham and the rest.</stagedir>
<line>Cousin of Buckingham, and sage grave men,</line>
<line>Since you will buckle Fortune on my back,</line>
<line>To bear her burden whe&#8217;er I will or no,</line>
<line>I must have patience to endure the load;</line>
<line>But if black scandal or foul-fac&#8217;d reproach</line>
<line>Attend the sequel of your imposition,</line>
<line>Your mere enforcement shall acquittance me</line>
<line>From all the impure blots and stains thereof;</line>
<line>For God doth know, and you may partly see,</line>
<line>How far I am from the desire of this.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MAY.</speaker>
<line>God bless your Grace! We see it and will say it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>In saying so you shall but say the truth.</line>
</speech>

<line>Lo, ere I can repeat this curse again,</line>
<line>Within so small a time, my woman&#8217;s heart</line>
<line>Grossly grew captive to his honey words,</line>
<line>And prov&#8217;d the subject of mine own soul&#8217;s curse,</line>
<line>Which hitherto hath held my eyes from rest;</line>
<line>For never yet one hour in his bed</line>
<line>Did I enjoy the golden dew of sleep,</line>
<line>But with his timorous dreams was still awak&#8217;d.</line>
<line>Besides, he hates me for my father Warwick,</line>

<line>I know a discontented gentleman</line>

<line>Look how thou dream&#8217;st! I say again, give out</line>

<stagedir>Exit Catesby.</stagedir>

<line>The mayor in courtesy show&#8217;d me the castle,</line>

<line>The tyrannous and bloody act is done,</line>

<line>Dighton and Forrest, who I did suborn</line>
<line>To do this piece of ruthless butchery,</line>
<line>Albeit they were flesh&#8217;d villains, bloody dogs,</line>
<line>Melted with tenderness and kind compassion,</line>
<line>Wept like two children in their deaths&#8217; sad story.</line>
<line>&#8220;O, thus,&#8221; quoth Dighton, &#8220;lay the gentle babes.&#8221;</line>
<line>&#8220;Thus, thus,&#8221; quoth Forrest, &#8220;girdling one another</line>
<line>Within their alablaster innocent arms.</line>
<line>Their lips were four red roses on a stalk,</line>
<line>Which in their summer beauty kiss&#8217;d each other.</line>
<line>A book of prayers on their pillow lay,</line>
<line>Which once,&#8221; quoth Forrest, &#8220;almost chang&#8217;d my mind;</line>
<line>But O! The devil&#8221;&#8212;there the villain stopp&#8217;d;</line>
<line>When Dighton thus told on, &#8220;We smothered</line>
<line>The most replenished sweet work of Nature</line>
<line>That from the prime creation e&#8217;er she framed.&#8221;</line>
<line>Hence both are gone with conscience and remorse</line>
<line>They could not speak; and so I left them both,</line>

<line>Thy other Edward dead, to quit my Edward;</line>
<line>Young York he is but boot, because both they</line>

<line>Thy Clarence he is dead that stabb&#8217;d my Edward,</line>

<line>I call&#8217;d thee then poor shadow, painted queen,</line>
<line>The presentation of but what I was;</line>
<line>The flattering index of a direful pageant;</line>
<line>One heav&#8217;d a-high, to be hurl&#8217;d down below;</line>
<line>A mother only mock&#8217;d with two fair babes;</line>
<line>A dream of what thou wast, a garish flag</line>
<line>To be the aim of every dangerous shot;</line>
<line>A sign of dignity, a breath, a bubble;</line>
<line>A queen in jest, only to fill the scene.</line>
<line>Where is thy husband now? Where be thy brothers?</line>
<line>Where be thy two sons? Wherein dost thou joy?</line>
<line>Who sues, and kneels, and says, &#8220;God save the Queen&#8221;?</line>
<line>Where be the bending peers that flattered thee?</line>
<line>Where be the thronging troops that followed thee?</line>
<line>Decline all this, and see what now thou art:</line>
<line>For happy wife, a most distressed widow;</line>
<line>For joyful mother, one that wails the name;</line>
<line>For one being sued to, one that humbly sues;</line>
<line>For queen, a very caitiff crown&#8217;d with care;</line>
<line>For she that scorn&#8217;d at me, now scorn&#8217;d of me;</line>
<line>For she being feared of all, now fearing one;</line>
<line>For she commanding all, obey&#8217;d of none.</line>
<line>Thus hath the course of justice whirl&#8217;d about,</line>
<line>And left thee but a very prey to time,</line>
<line>Having no more but thought of what thou wast</line>
<line>To torture thee the more, being what thou art.</line>
<line>Thou didst usurp my place, and dost thou not</line>
<line>Usurp the just proportion of my sorrow?</line>
<line>Now thy proud neck bears half my burden&#8217;d yoke,</line>
<line>From which even here I slip my weary head,</line>
<line>And leave the burden of it all on thee.</line>
<line>Farewell, York&#8217;s wife, and queen of sad mischance,</line>
<line>These English woes shall make me smile in France.</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. MAR.</speaker>
<line>Forbear to sleep the nights, and fast the days;</line>
<line>Compare dead happiness with living woe;</line>
<line>Think that thy babes were sweeter than they were,</line>
<line>And he that slew them fouler than he is.</line>
<line>Bett&#8217;ring thy loss makes the bad causer worse;</line>
<line>Revolving this will teach thee how to curse.</line>

<line>Where is the gentle Rivers, Vaughan, Grey?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUCH.</speaker>

<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line>A flourish, trumpets! Strike alarum, drums!</line>
<line>Let not the heavens hear these tell-tale women</line>
<line>Rail on the Lord&#8217;s anointed. Strike, I say!</line>

<stagedir>Flourish. Alarums.</stagedir>
<line>Either be patient and entreat me fair,</line>
<line>Or with the clamorous report of war</line>
<line>Thus will I drown your exclamations.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUCH.</speaker>
<line>Art thou my son?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line>Ay, I thank God, my father, and yourself.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUCH.</speaker>
<line>Then patiently hear my impatience.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line>Madam, I have a touch of your condition,</line>
<line>That cannot brook the accent of reproof.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUCH.</speaker>
<line>O, let me speak!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Do then, but I&#8217;ll not hear.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUCH.</speaker>
<line>I will be mild and gentle in my words.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line>And brief, good mother, for I am in haste.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUCH.</speaker>
<line>Art thou so hasty? I have stay&#8217;d for thee,</line>
<line>God knows, in torment and in agony.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line>And came I not at last to comfort you?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUCH.</speaker>
<line>No, by the holy rood, thou know&#8217;st it well,</line>
<line>Thou cam&#8217;st on earth to make the earth my hell.</line>
<line>A grievous burden was thy birth to me,</line>
<line>Tetchy and wayward was thy infancy;</line>
<line>Thy school-days frightful, desp&#8217;rate, wild, and furious,</line>
<line>Thy prime of manhood daring, bold, and venturous;</line>
<line>Thy age confirm&#8217;d, proud, subtle, sly, and bloody,</line>
<line>More mild, but yet more harmful&#8212;kind in hatred.</line>
<line>What comfortable hour canst thou name</line>
<line>That ever grac&#8217;d me with thy company?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line>Faith, none, but Humphrey Hour, that call&#8217;d your Grace</line>
<line>To breakfast once, forth of my company.</line>
<line>If I be so disgracious in your eye,</line>
<line>Let me march on and not offend you, madam.</line>
<line>Strike up the drum.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUCH.</speaker>
<line offset="4">I prithee hear me speak.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line>You speak too bitterly.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUCH.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Hear me a word;</line>
<line>For I shall never speak to thee again.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line>So.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUCH.</speaker>
<line>Either thou wilt die by God&#8217;s just ordinance</line>
<line>Ere from this war thou turn a conqueror,</line>
<line>Or I with grief and extreme age shall perish</line>
<line>And never more behold thy face again.</line>
<line>Therefore take with thee my most grievous curse,</line>
<line>Which in the day of battle tire thee more</line>
<line>Than all the complete armor that thou wear&#8217;st!</line>
<line>My prayers on the adverse party fight,</line>
<line>And there the little souls of Edward&#8217;s children</line>
<line>Whisper the spirits of thine enemies</line>
<line>And promise them success and victory.</line>
<line>Bloody thou art, bloody will be thy end;</line>
<line>Shame serves thy life and doth thy death attend.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. ELIZ.</speaker>
<line>Though far more cause, yet much less spirit to curse</line>
<line>Abides in me; I say amen to her.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line>Stay, madam, I must talk a word with you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. ELIZ.</speaker>
<line>I have no more sons of the royal blood</line>
<line>For thee to slaughter. For my daughters, Richard,</line>
<line>They shall be praying nuns, not weeping queens;</line>
<line>And therefore level not to hit their lives.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line>You have a daughter call&#8217;d Elizabeth,</line>
<line>Virtuous and fair, royal and gracious.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. ELIZ.</speaker>
<line>And must she die for this? O, let her live!</line>
<line>And I&#8217;ll corrupt her manners, stain her beauty,</line>
<line>Slander myself as false to Edward&#8217;s bed,</line>
<line>Throw over her the veil of infamy.</line>
<line>So she may live unscarr&#8217;d of bleeding slaughter,</line>
<line>I will confess she was not Edward&#8217;s daughter.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line>Wrong not her birth, she is a royal princess.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. ELIZ.</speaker>
<line>To save her life, I&#8217;ll say she is not so.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line>Her life is safest only in her birth.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. ELIZ.</speaker>
<line>And only in that safety died her brothers.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line>Lo at their birth good stars were opposite.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. ELIZ.</speaker>
<line>No, to their lives ill friends were contrary.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line>All unavoided is the doom of destiny.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. ELIZ.</speaker>
<line>True&#8212;when avoided grace makes destiny:</line>
<line>My babes were destin&#8217;d to a fairer death,</line>
<line>If grace had blest thee with a fairer life.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line>You speak as if that I had slain my cousins!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. ELIZ.</speaker>
<line>Cousins indeed, and by their uncle cozen&#8217;d</line>
<line>Of comfort, kingdom, kindred, freedom, life.</line>
<line>Whose hand soever lanch&#8217;d their tender hearts,</line>
<line>Thy head (all indirectly) gave direction.</line>
<line>No doubt the murd&#8217;rous knife was dull and blunt</line>
<line>Till it was whetted on thy stone-hard heart</line>
<line>To revel in the entrails of my lambs.</line>
<line>But that still use of grief makes wild grief tame,</line>
<line>My tongue should to thy ears not name my boys</line>
<line>Till that my nails were anchor&#8217;d in thine eyes;</line>
<line>And I, in such a desp&#8217;rate bay of death,</line>
<line>Like a poor bark of sails and tackling reft,</line>
<line>Rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line>Madam, so thrive I in my enterprise</line>
<line>And dangerous success of bloody wars,</line>
<line>As I intend more good to you and yours</line>
<line>Than ever you or yours by me were harm&#8217;d!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. ELIZ.</speaker>
<line>What good is cover&#8217;d with the face of heaven,</line>
<line>To be discover&#8217;d, that can do me good?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line>Th&#8217; advancement of your children, gentle lady.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. ELIZ.</speaker>
<line>Up to some scaffold, there to lose their heads.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line>Unto the dignity and height of fortune,</line>
<line>The high imperial type of this earth&#8217;s glory.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. ELIZ.</speaker>
<line>Flatter my sorrow with report of it;</line>
<line>Tell me, what state, what dignity, what honor,</line>
<line>Canst thou demise to any child of mine?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line>Even all I have&#8212;ay, and myself and all&#8212;</line>
<line>Will I withal endow a child of thine;</line>
<line>So in the Lethe of thy angry soul</line>
<line>Thou drown the sad remembrance of those wrongs</line>
<line>Which thou supposest I have done to thee.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. ELIZ.</speaker>
<line>Be brief, lest that the process of thy kindness</line>
<line>Last longer telling than thy kindness&#8217; date.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line>Then know that from my soul I love thy daughter.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. ELIZ.</speaker>
<line>My daughter&#8217;s mother thinks it with her soul.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line>What do you think?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. ELIZ.</speaker>
<line>That thou dost love my daughter from thy soul;</line>
<line>So from thy soul&#8217;s love didst thou love her brothers,</line>
<line>And from my heart&#8217;s love I do thank thee for it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line>Be not so hasty to confound my meaning:</line>
<line>I mean that with my soul I love thy daughter,</line>
<line>And do intend to make her Queen of England.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. ELIZ.</speaker>
<line>Well then, who dost thou mean shall be her king?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line>Even he that makes her queen. Who should be else?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. ELIZ.</speaker>
<line>What, thou?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line offset="3">Even so. How think you of it?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. ELIZ.</speaker>
<line>How canst thou woo her?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line offset="5">That would I learn of you,</line>
<line>As one being best acquainted with her humor.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. ELIZ.</speaker>
<line>And wilt thou learn of me?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Madam, with all my heart.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. ELIZ.</speaker>
<line>Send to her by the man that slew her brothers</line>
<line>A pair of bleeding hearts; thereon engrave</line>
<line>&#8220;Edward&#8221; and &#8220;York&#8221;; then haply will she weep.</line>
<line>Therefore present to her&#8212;as sometimes Margaret</line>
<line>Did to thy father, steep&#8217;d in Rutland&#8217;s blood&#8212;</line>
<line>A handkercher, which, say to her, did drain</line>
<line>The purple sap from her sweet brother&#8217;s body,</line>
<line>And bid her wipe her weeping eyes withal.</line>
<line>If this inducement move her not to love,</line>
<line>Send her a letter of thy noble deeds:</line>
<line>Tell her thou mad&#8217;st away her uncle Clarence,</line>
<line>Her uncle Rivers, ay (and for her sake!),</line>
<line>Mad&#8217;st quick conveyance with her good aunt Anne.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line>You mock me, madam, this is not the way</line>
<line>To win your daughter.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. ELIZ.</speaker>
<line offset="4">There is no other way,</line>
<line>Unless thou couldst put on some other shape</line>
<line>And not be Richard that hath done all this.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line>Say that I did all this for love of her.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. ELIZ.</speaker>
<line>Nay then indeed she cannot choose but hate thee,</line>
<line>Having bought love with such a bloody spoil.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line>Look what is done cannot be now amended:</line>
<line>Men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes,</line>
<line>Which after-hours gives leisure to repent.</line>
<line>If I did take the kingdom from your sons,</line>
<line>To make amends I&#8217;ll give it to your daughter;</line>
<line>If I have kill&#8217;d the issue of your womb,</line>
<line>To quicken your increase, I will beget</line>
<line>Mine issue of your blood upon your daughter.</line>
<line>A grandam&#8217;s name is little less in love</line>
<line>Than is the doting title of a mother;</line>
<line>They are as children but one step below,</line>
<line>Even of your metal, of your very blood;</line>
<line>Of all one pain, save for a night of groans</line>
<line>Endur&#8217;d of her, for whom you bid like sorrow.</line>
<line>Your children were vexation to your youth,</line>
<line>But mine shall be a comfort to your age.</line>
<line>The loss you have is but a son being king,</line>
<line>And by that loss your daughter is made queen.</line>
<line>I cannot make you what amends I would,</line>
<line>Therefore accept such kindness as I can.</line>
<line>Dorset your son, that with a fearful soul</line>
<line>Leads discontented steps in foreign soil,</line>
<line>This fair alliance quickly shall call home</line>
<line>To high promotions and great dignity.</line>
<line>The King, that calls your beauteous daughter wife,</line>
<line>Familiarly shall call thy Dorset brother;</line>
<line>Again shall you be mother to a king;</line>
<line>And all the ruins of distressful times</line>
<line>Repair&#8217;d with double riches of content.</line>
<line>What? We have many goodly days to see:</line>
<line>The liquid drops of tears that you have shed</line>
<line>Shall come again, transform&#8217;d to orient pearl,</line>
<line>Advantaging their love with interest</line>
<line>Of ten times double gain of happiness.</line>
<line>Go then, my mother, to thy daughter go,</line>
<line>Make bold her bashful years with your experience;</line>
<line>Prepare her ears to hear a wooer&#8217;s tale;</line>
<line>Put in her tender heart th&#8217; aspiring flame</line>
<line>Of golden sovereignty; acquaint the Princess</line>
<line>With the sweet silent hours of marriage joys;</line>
<line>And when this arm of mine hath chastised</line>
<line>The petty rebel, dull-brain&#8217;d Buckingham,</line>
<line>Bound with triumphant garlands will I come</line>
<line>And lead thy daughter to a conqueror&#8217;s bed;</line>
<line>To whom I will retail my conquest won,</line>
<line>And she shall be sole victoress, Caesar&#8217;s Caesar.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. ELIZ.</speaker>
<line>What were I best to say? Her father&#8217;s brother</line>
<line>Would be her lord? Or shall I say her uncle?</line>
<line>Or he that slew her brothers and her uncles?</line>
<line>Under what title shall I woo for thee,</line>
<line>That God, the law, my honor, and her love</line>
<line>Can make seem pleasing to her tender years?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line>Infer fair England&#8217;s peace by this alliance.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. ELIZ.</speaker>
<line>Which she shall purchase with still-lasting war.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line>Tell her the King, that may command, entreats.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. ELIZ.</speaker>
<line>That at her hands which the King&#8217;s King forbids.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line>Say she shall be a high and mighty queen.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. ELIZ.</speaker>
<line>To vail the title, as her mother doth.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line>Say I will love her everlastingly.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. ELIZ.</speaker>
<line>But how long shall that title &#8220;ever&#8221; last?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line>Sweetly in force unto her fair live&#8217;s end.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. ELIZ.</speaker>
<line>But how long fairly shall her sweet life last?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line>As long as heaven and nature lengthens it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. ELIZ.</speaker>
<line>As long as hell and Richard likes of it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line>Say I, her sovereign, am her subject low.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. ELIZ.</speaker>
<line>But she, your subject, loathes such sovereignty.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line>Be eloquent in my behalf to her.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. ELIZ.</speaker>
<line>An honest tale speeds best being plainly told.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line>Then plainly to her tell my loving tale.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. ELIZ.</speaker>
<line>Plain and not honest is too harsh a style.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line>Your reasons are too shallow and too quick.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. ELIZ.</speaker>
<line>O no, my reasons are too deep and dead&#8212;</line>
<line>Too deep and dead, poor infants, in their graves.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line>Harp not on that string, madam, that is past.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. ELIZ.</speaker>
<line>Harp on it still shall I till heart-strings break.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line>Now by my George, my Garter, and my crown&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>

<line>Profan&#8217;d, dishonor&#8217;d, and the third usurp&#8217;d.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line>I swear&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. ELIZ.</speaker>
<line offset="2">By nothing, for this is no oath:</line>
<line>Thy George, profan&#8217;d, hath lost his lordly honor;</line>
<line>Thy Garter, blemish&#8217;d, pawn&#8217;d his knightly virtue;</line>
<line>Thy crown, usurp&#8217;d, disgrac&#8217;d his kingly glory.</line>

<line offset="4">God&#8217;s wrong is most of all:</line>
<line>If thou didst fear to break an oath with him,</line>
<line>The unity the King my husband made</line>
<line>Thou hadst not broken, nor my brothers died.</line>
<line>If thou hadst fear&#8217;d to break an oath by him,</line>
<line>Th&#8217; imperial metal, circling now thy head,</line>
<line>Had grac&#8217;d the tender temples of my child,</line>
<line>And both the Princes had been breathing here,</line>

<line>Heaven and fortune bar me happy hours!</line>
<line>Day, yield me not thy light, nor, night, thy rest!</line>
<line>Be opposite all planets of good luck</line>

<line>The lights burn blue. It is now dead midnight.</line>
<line>Cold fearful drops stand on my trembling flesh.</line>
<line>What do I fear? Myself? There&#8217;s none else by.</line>
<line>Richard loves Richard, that is, I am I.</line>
<line>Is there a murderer here? No. Yes, I am.</line>

<line>For hateful deeds committed by myself.</line>
<line>I am a villain; yet I lie, I am not.</line>
<line>Fool, of thyself speak well; fool, do not flatter:</line>
<line>My conscience hath a thousand several tongues,</line>
<line>And every tongue brings in a several tale,</line>
<line>And every tale condemns me for a villain.</line>
<line>Perjury, perjury, in the highest degree;</line>

<line>All several sins, all us&#8217;d in each degree,</line>
<line>Throng to the bar, crying all, &#8220;Guilty! Guilty!&#8221;</line>

<line>Cry mercy, lords and watchful gentlemen,</line>
<line>That you have ta&#8217;en a tardy sluggard here.</line>

<line>The sweetest sleep and fairest-boding dreams</line>
<line>That ever ent&#8217;red in a drowsy head</line>

<line>Methought their souls whose bodies Richard murder&#8217;d</line>
<line>Came to my tent and cried on victory.</line>
<line>I promise you, my soul is very jocund</line>
<line>In the remembrance of so fair a dream.</line>
<line>How far into the morning is it, lords?</line>

<speaker>1. LORD. RICH.</speaker>
<line>Upon the stroke of four.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>RICHM.</speaker>
<line>Why, then &#8217;tis time to arm and give direction.</line>

<stagedir>His oration to his Soldiers.</stagedir>
<line>More than I have said, loving countrymen,</line>
<line>The leisure and enforcement of the time</line>
<line>Forbids to dwell upon, yet remember this:</line>
<line>God and our good cause fight upon our side;</line>
<line>The prayers of holy saints and wronged souls,</line>
<line>Like high-rear&#8217;d bulwarks, stand before our faces.</line>
<line>Richard except, those whom we fight against</line>
<line>Had rather have us win than him they follow:</line>
<line>For what is he they follow? Truly, gentlemen,</line>
<line>A bloody tyrant and a homicide;</line>
<line>One rais&#8217;d in blood, and one in blood established;</line>
<line>One that made means to come by what he hath,</line>
<line>And slaughtered those that were the means to help him;</line>
<line>A base foul stone, made precious by the foil</line>
<line>Of England&#8217;s chair, where he is falsely set;</line>
<line>One that hath ever been God&#8217;s enemy.</line>
<line>Then if you fight against God&#8217;s enemy,</line>
<line>God will in justice ward you as his soldiers;</line>
<line>If you do sweat to put a tyrant down,</line>
<line>You sleep in peace, the tyrant being slain;</line>
<line>If you do fight against your country&#8217;s foes,</line>
<line>Your country&#8217;s fat shall pay your pains the hire;</line>
<line>If you do fight in safeguard of your wives,</line>
<line>Your wives shall welcome home the conquerors;</line>
<line>If you do free your children from the sword,</line>
<line>Your children&#8217;s children quits it in your age.</line>
<line>Then in the name of God and all these rights,</line>
<line>Advance your standards, draw your willing swords.</line>
<line>For me, the ransom of my bold attempt</line>
<line>Shall be this cold corpse on the earth&#8217;s cold face;</line>
<line>But if I thrive, the gain of my attempt</line>
<line>The least of you shall share his part thereof.</line>
<line>Sound drums and trumpets boldly and cheerfully.</line>

<line>Let not our babbling dreams affright our souls;</line>
<line>Conscience is but a word that cowards use,</line>

<line>March on, join bravely, let us to it pell-mell;</line>
<line>If not to heaven, then hand in hand to hell.</line>

<stagedir>His oration to his Army.</stagedir>
<line>What shall I say more than I have inferr&#8217;d?</line>
<line>Remember whom you are to cope withal:</line>
<line>A sort of vagabonds, rascals, and runaways,</line>
<line>A scum of Britains and base lackey peasants,</line>
<line>Whom their o&#8217;ercloyed country vomits forth</line>
<line>To desperate adventures and assur&#8217;d destruction.</line>
<line>You sleeping safe, they bring to you unrest;</line>
<line>You having lands, and blest with beauteous wives,</line>
<line>They would restrain the one, distain the other.</line>
<line>And who doth lead them but a paltry fellow,</line>
<line>Long kept in Britain at our mother&#8217;s cost?</line>
<line>A milksop, one that never in his life</line>
<line>Felt so much cold as over shoes in snow?</line>
<line>Let&#8217;s whip these stragglers o&#8217;er the seas again;</line>
<line>Lash hence these overweening rags of France,</line>
<line>These famish&#8217;d beggars weary of their lives,</line>
<line>Who (but for dreaming on this fond exploit)</line>
<line>For want of means, poor rats, had hang&#8217;d themselves.</line>
<line>If we be conquered, let men conquer us,</line>
<line>And not these bastard Britains, whom our fathers</line>
<line>Have in their own land beaten, bobb&#8217;d, and thump&#8217;d,</line>
<line>And in record left them the heirs of shame.</line>
<line>Shall these enjoy our lands? Lie with our wives?</line>
<line>Ravish our daughters?</line>

<stagedir>Drum afar off.</stagedir>
