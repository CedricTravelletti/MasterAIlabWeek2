<personae playtitle="Richard III">

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="K. EDW.">King Edward the Fourth</persname>
<persdescription>King Edward IV is the same as the King Edward of <persnameref>Henry VI, Part Three</persnameref>, who won his throne by battle. He is much older now, and very ill. He is incurably optimistic and hopes to be able to reconcile all of the warring factions of his court, but at the same time is suspicious and superstitious enough to imprison his brother Clarence on the word of the fortune-teller. (Considering how easily Clarence betrays people &#8212; see <persnameref>Henry VI, Part Three</persnameref> &#8212; this is not necessarily foolish on his part.) His marrying a penniless widow and raising her brothers and sons to the nobility incensed many of his followers (see Henry VI Part Three) and they have still not calmed down, despite the King&#8217;s best efforts. He still enjoys the company of women, and keeps a mistress fairly openly. Though he signs a death warrant for his brother, he rescinds the order; the shock of hearing that it has been carried out shocks him to his core and brings on his death.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="PRINCE.">Edward, Prince of Wales</persname>
<persdescription>Prince Edward is King Edward&#8217;s eldest son and heir to his throne, the same as the baby of the final scene in <persnameref>Henry VI, Part Three</persnameref>. He is a proud and intelligent child who intends to rule properly, and is suspicious of his uncle Richard. He loves his mother&#8217;s relatives and is quietly distraught at their execution. He gives every sign of growing into an excellent monarch, even intending to fight in France like another Henry V, but this is not to be. Disinherited and locked in the Tower by his uncle, he is smothered in his sleep along with his brother. His ghost returns to haunt Richard before the battle of Bosworth and to bless Richard&#8217;s opponent Richmond.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="YORK.">Richard, Duke of York</persname>
<persdescription>Duke of York (Richard) is King Edward&#8217;s second son. He is a cheeky young thing, bright beyond his years, given to eavesdropping and not shy with his opinions. He gets on reasonably well with his namesake uncle, but slanders him in his absence; he is the only person who dares to comment on Richard&#8217;s deformities in his presence. Even his mother and brother think he goes too far sometimes. He is scared of ghosts. Locked in the Tower by his uncle, along with his brother Edward, he is smothered in his sleep. His ghost returns to haunt Richard before the battle of Bosworth and to bless Richard&#8217;s opponent Richmond.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="CLAR.">George, Duke of Clarence</persname>
<persaliases>
	<persname short="GHOST. OF C.">Ghost of Clarence</persname>
</persaliases>
<persdescription>George, Duke of Clarence is the brother of King Edward and Richard of Gloucester, and the same as the Clarence of <persnameref>Henry VI, Part Three</persnameref>. Not the most intelligent of the three brothers, he is easily led by the nose by Richard, whom he is convinced loves him dearly. Always an object of suspicion because of his betrayals during the civil wars (see <persnameref>Henry VI, Part Three</persnameref>), he is sent to the Tower by Edward on the basis of a superstitious prophecy. The memory of his various treacheries gnaws at his conscience. Clarence is known to be a convincing speaker, and attempts to talk his way out of his assassination; always gullible, he dies refusing to believe that Richard is behind his death. His ghost returns to haunt Richard before the battle of Bosworth and to bless Richard&#8217;s opponent Richmond.</persdescription>

<persname short="EDW.">Edward Plantagenet</persname>
<persaliases>
	<persname short="CHIL.">Children</persname>
	<persname short="GHOSTS. PRINC.">Ghosts of Princes</persname>
</persaliases>
<persdescription>Edward Plantagenet is the son of George Duke of Clarence, and is in his grandmother the Duchess of York&#8217;s keeping after Clarence&#8217;s arrest. Ferreting out the fact of his father&#8217;s death from his grandmother, he blames the King, as he trusts his uncle Richard&#8217;s slanders against Queen Elizabeth. He refuses to weep for the King&#8217;s death unless the Queen weeps for his father&#8217;s. Richard has him locked up to avoid more succession troubles as he takes the throne.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="GLOU., K. RICH.">Richard, Duke of Gloucester</persname>
<persdescription>Richard Duke of Gloucester, later King Richard III, is rather a nasty piece of work. Duplicitous, ambitious, murderous, and quite jolly about all of these things, he has been planning to take the crown for some time now (see <persnameref>Henry VI, Part Three</persnameref>). He possesses a very keen, very dark sense of humor, and revels in his own mischief. He thinks nothing of killing off brothers or other family members in order to obtain his goal, although it must be admitted that once he gets the throne he doesn&#8217;t really seem to know what to do next. Though crippled, with an essentially useless left arm, a limp and a hunchback, he is a brilliant soldier and very dangerous fighter, though his abilities on the battlefield are almost nothing next to what he can do with his mind alone. He is excellent at insinuating and sowing discord, and is a master at double entendres. The ultimate actor, he insists on his own honesty to anyone who will hear before dropping the mask and confiding to himself (or the audience) that he is not. Even those who know perfectly well what he is capable of remain convinced that he will never turn on them, because they know and are therefore accomplices, never realizing that Richard works only for one person, himself. Richard is and has always been loathed by his mother, who suffered during her pregnancy with him and considers him her greatest shame. He tests himself constantly, whether in aiming for the crown when he no longer has war to distract him, successfully wooing the widow of a man he killed over the coffin of her father-in-law, or organizing a coup that sheds almost no blood. He despises his brother Edward&#8217;s sensuality, as he himself takes little pleasure in anything but manipulating people and his own successful villainy. He is a great religious hypocrite, swearing mostly by Saint Paul and always clothing himself in meekness and piety. Richard has a talent for bringing out the worst in people and bending that worst to his own will without their realizing it. Though he prefers to work indirectly, he is not a coward, and refuses to flee from the battle of Bosworth, fighting at the most dangerous parts of the battle, seeking out Richmond. As self-aware as he is, he is deeply disturbed when on the eve of the battle of Bosworth he discovers he has a conscience; he is almost as unsettled by the fact that no-one will mourn for him when he dies as by the realization that he does actually love one being &#8212; himself.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="RICHM.">Henry, Earl of Richmond</persname>
<persdescription>Henry, Earl of Richmond is the grown-up Richmond of <persnameref>Henry VI, Part Three</persnameref>, Lord Stanley&#8217;s stepson and the next heir in blood of the Lancastrian cause. He becomes the focal point of resistance to Richard, offering refuge to all those who flee England in fear as Richard&#8217;s regime takes over. A pious man, he rallies his troops in God&#8217;s name, offering himself as England&#8217;s salvation against tyranny and rekindling their anger by listing Richard&#8217;s wrongs. Pardoning all those who fought against him so long as they acknowledge his victory, he marries the daughter of King Edward and Queen Elizabeth as a way to join the two families of York and Lancaster in one and thus end the cause of the civil wars. It is possible that he has dressed several of his men as himself to keep himself safe in the battle of Bosworth. He kills Richard personally, and becomes King Henry VII.</persdescription>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="CARD.">Cardinal Bourchier</persname>
<persdescription>Cardinal Bourchier, Archbishop of Canterbur, accompanies Prince Edward to London, and then goes to help convince Queen Elizabeth to let her son York leave sanctuary. He stands upon the privilege of the church, but is reasonably easy to convince otherwise.</persdescription>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="BUCK.">Duke of Buckingham</persname>
<persaliases>
	<persname short="GHOST OF BUCK.">Ghost of Duke of Buckingham</persname>
</persaliases>
<persdescription>The Duke of Buckingham is Richard&#8217;s closest ally as he maneuvers himself onto the throne. An enemy of the Queen&#8217;s family, he disregards Queen Margaret&#8217;s warnings about Richard; he believes himself to be much more in control of the situation than he actually is, not realizing that Richard allows him to see himself in the driver&#8217;s seat. A good actor, Buckingham is the major force in the coup that sets Richard on the throne, and the mastermind of the show that convinces the citizens that the Duke of Gloucester is reluctant to take the crown. He is cunning and cynical, but cannot go as far as Richard does; the thought of putting the Princes to death shocks him, which immediately loses him Richard&#8217;s favor. Realizing that he will never be safe and that the new King does not intend to share any form of power, he flees the court and soon raises a rebellion against the man he put on the throne. His army is scattered by a flood, and the invading Richmond does not trust him, leading to the failure of his rebellion and his own capture. He realizes as he is led to execution that he is paying exactly the penalty he begged for himself should he break his oath when he swore friendship with Queen Elizabeth. Buckingham is a proud, daring, and ambitious man who suffers from not realizing the extent of Richard&#8217;s malice and the fact that nobody can trust him. His ghost comes to haunt Richard the night before the battle of Bosworth and to bless Richard&#8217;s opponent Richmond.</persdescription>

<persname short="SUR.">Earl of Surrey</persname>

<persname short="RIV.">Earl Rivers</persname>
<persaliases>
	<persname short="GHOST OF R.">Ghost of Earl Rivers</persname>
</persaliases>
<persdescription>Earl Rivers (Anthony Woodvile) is Queen Elizabeth&#8217;s brother, the same as the Rivers of <persnameref>Henry VI, Part Three</persnameref>. Ennobled following his sister&#8217;s marriage, he is one of the chief irritants to the old nobility at the court of England, who regard him as an upstart. Though he tries to keep in his place, he will defend his sisters against all comers, including Richard Duke of Gloucester, one of their chief enemies. He fought on the Yorkist side in the wars and was present at the killing of Queen Margaret&#8217;s son Edward. He dislikes Lord Hastings and was responsible for having him sent to the Tower. He attempts to comfort his sister after King Edward&#8217;s death, and questions why his nephew should only have a small escort to come to London, though he agrees with Buckingham&#8217;s explanation that a large escort might frighten the country. He is mistrusted by the common people as well as by the nobility, and no-one other than his sister weeps for him when he is taken and executed on Richard&#8217;s orders. He meets his death well, though remembering the curse Queen Margaret put on him for not saving her son at his murder. His ghost returns to haunt Richard before the battle of Bosworth and to bless Richard&#8217;s opponent Richmond.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="female">
<persname short="DOR.">Marquess of Dorset</persname>
<persdescription>Marquess of Dorset is Queen Elizabeth&#8217;s son by her previous marriage, ennobled after his mother&#8217;s marriage to King Edward. This leaves him a deep irritant to the traditional nobility, who regard him as an upstart, and to the populace, who resent his pride. He fought on the Yorkist side in the wars and was present at the killing of Queen Margaret&#8217;s son Edward. He attempts to comfort his mother after King Edward&#8217;s death. He flies England to join Richmond in France to avoid being arrested and executed like his brother and uncle after Richard takes power.</persdescription>

<persdescription>Lord Grey is Queen Elizabeth&#8217;s son by her previous marriage, ennobled after his mother&#8217;s marriage to King Edward. This leaves him a deep irritant to the traditional nobility, who regard him as an upstart, and to the populace, who resent his pride. He attempts to reassure his mother that they are secure despite the King&#8217;s illness. He is one of the lords who go to fetch Prince Edward after the King&#8217;s death, on which journey he is arrested on Richard&#8217;s orders and soon put to death. He dies well. His ghost returns to haunt Richard before the battle of Bosworth and to bless Richard&#8217;s opponent Richmond.</persdescription>

<persname short="HAST.">Lord Hastings</persname>
<persaliases>
	<persname short="GHOST OF H.">Ghost of Lord Hastings</persname>
</persaliases>
<persdescription>Lord William Hastings is the Lord Chamberlain, the same characters as the Hastings of <persnameref>Henry VI, Part Three</persnameref>. He is not a friend of Queen Elizabeth&#8217;s family, particularly as her son has had him imprisoned. However, he is a loyal subject of King Edward&#8217;s and a strong supporter of legitimacy, preferring to see the rightful heir on the throne however young and even if it means bringing the Queen&#8217;s family to power. He is a faintly gullible sort, unable to understand why the Queen should take sanctuary after her husband dies, seeing as they have all sworn friendship at the late King&#8217;s request. He takes Mrs. Shore, King Edward&#8217;s mistress, for his own after Edward dies. Hastings has great hopes for power under Richard as Protector, seeing it as a chance to settle accounts with some old enemies, and never dreams that he might himself be at risk. He is an energetic man with a carefree manner about him, and is not a particularly deep thinker; he takes every man at face value and pays no attention to ill omens, which is unfortunate for him. His inability to see where things are headed costs him his head. His ghost comes to haunt Richard the night before the battle of Bosworth and to bless Richard&#8217;s opponent Richmond.</persdescription>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="STAN.">Lord Stanley</persname>
<persdescription>Lord Stanley, Earl of Derby is a close friend of Lord Hastings and Henry Earl of Richmond&#8217;s stepfather. He is no great fan of the Queen&#8217;s family, but he is a good and honest man so far as he can afford to be. The execution of Rivers, Grey and Vaughan disturb him, as he sees that no-one may now be safe, and a premonitory dream almost leads him to flee the country until Hastings refuses to follow him. He dares say nothing when Hastings is suddenly condemned to death. Though he appears to support Richard, he works against him as much as he can, helping Dorset to escape to France and acting as go-between for the marriage arrangement between Richmond and Princess Elizabeth. Despite his reputation for honesty he cannot entirely trick Richard, who takes his son George as a hostage when Richmond attacks. As he loves his son, Stanley waits until the last possible moment before betraying Richard. He takes it upon himself to crown Richmond as King.</persdescription>

<persdescription>Sir William Catesby is one of Richard&#8217;s chief supporters and an important figure in his coup. He attempts to win Hastings over to Richard&#8217;s cause with a quite stunning lack of subtlety, and fails. He is one of the main actors in the scene that convinces the citizens that Richard is reluctant to take the throne. He later arranges for the marriage of Clarence&#8217;s daughter to a nobody and starts spreading the rumors that make the Lady Anne&#8217;s death less of a surprise. A close attendant on Richard, he follows him to the battle of Bosworth and attempts to help him to flee when it becomes clear that all is lost, only to see his offer refused. Catesby is a very loyal man, staying faithful to Richard even when the latter mistreats him.</persdescription>

<persdescription>Sir Robert Brakenbury is the Lieutenant of the Tower of London, a stubbornly loyal man who does his job to the letter no matter his own thoughts on the matter. He does not wish to get caught up in politics, rather only to obey whoever happens to be wearing the crown, which is where he recognizes his loyalties to lie. He washes his hands of all that does not concern him and prefers not to know what is going on even when it is obvious. He is killed at the battle of Bosworth, fighting for Richard.</persdescription>

<persname short="Q. ELIZ.">Queen Elizabeth</persname>
<persaliases>
	<persname short="Q. ELIZ. AND DUCH.">Both Queen Elizabeth and Duchess of York</persname>
</persaliases>
<persdescription>Queen Elizabeth is the wife of King Edward, the Lady Gray of <persnameref>Henry VI, Part Three</persnameref>. A penniless widow with children when she married the King, she is hated by most of the old nobility for her rise to power and the way her family has snuck its way into aristocratic ranks (see <persnameref>Henry VI, Part Three</persnameref>). Despite her best efforts, she is unable to gain their friendship and is blamed for all of King Edward&#8217;s unpopular decisions, which leaves her terrified of what will happen to her and her family once the very ill King dies. She puts up with a great deal from her opponents, but even her patience has its limits and she sometimes snaps, especially at her brother-in-law Richard, the worst of her detractors and a man she rightly fears. The fact that he is to be Protector over her son until his majority shakes her, and she flies to sanctuary with her younger son York to attempt to avoid the calamities she foresees. This is unfortunately unsuccessful, as York is taken from her and she is separated from her children forever. Her brother Rivers is executed, along with her son by a previous marriage, Gray; she urges her last remaining son, Dorset, to flee. She promises to do anything to have her daughters spared by Richard, and is shocked and horrified when Richard proposes to marry her daughter Elizabeth. His persuasion appears to convince her to try to get her daughter&#8217;s agreement to the marriage, but she may simply be dissembling to give herself time to get away. Her daughter ends up marrying Richmond. Queen Elizabeth is rarely strong, and generally takes fate&#8217;s blows without trying to avoid them; her suffering is almost constant throughout the play, and she is haunted by Queen Margaret&#8217;s curse on her.</persdescription>

<persona gender="female">
<persname short="Q. MAR.">Queen Margaret</persname>
<persdescription>Queen Margaret is the widow of King Henry VI, the same character as the Queen Margaret of the <persnameref>Henry VI</persnameref> plays. Though exiled, she returns to England to witness the destruction of her enemies. Half-crazed by grief, she ritually curses all those who stood by as her son was murdered and did nothing as well as those who did the deed and those who profited. She refuses to acknowledge any of her own crimes (see the Henry VI plays) and concentrates instead on the people who hold the power she has lost. She ends up almost befriending Queen Elizabeth once the latter&#8217;s woes come to match her own. Her hatred seems to be all that keeps her alive. She is often more a chorus figure than an actual character.</persdescription>

<persdescription>The Duchess of York is the mother of King Edward, Clarence and Richard, and the widow of the Duke of York of the three <persnameref>Henry VI </persnameref>plays. She is a tough, uncompromising woman whom grief has left bitter and who has no illusions about her third son, whom she openly detests and considers a shame to herself. She tries to protect her grandchildren from the realities of the world, but unsuccessfully; she is not overly kind to her daughter-in-law Queen Elizabeth, and forever reminds people of just how many family members she herself has lost. She is sick of seeing all her family fight for the crown and all the ills that desire causes. She ends up as a full opponent of her own son, openly challenging him for the murders he has done, which so discomfits him that he has drums drown her out. Her last words to him are a curse.</persdescription>

<persdescription>Lady Anne is the daughter of the Earl of Warwick (see <persnameref>Henry VI, Part Three</persnameref>) and the widow of Prince Edward of Lancaster, whom Richard helped kill. She is the only person to follow her father-in-law Henry VI&#8217;s coffin to burial and to mourn him. Suddenly courted by Richard at the height of her grief, she is taken off her guard but finds herself unable to resist his performance as a lover. Despite her quite genuine hatred, despair and mourning, and her insistence that she is making no promises, she ends up completely seduced by him. Though this ends up making her Queen, it does not bring her happiness, which she blames on her having cursed Richard&#8217;s future wife before taking on that role. Richard&#8217;s bad dreams keep her awake at night, and she does not sleep well. She is soon perfectly aware that Richard does not care for her, and grows certain that he will kill her. She grows ill and dies, very likely poisoned by him. Anne is a weak and passive woman, though she attempts to be a good aunt to the various children of her husband&#8217;s brothers. Her ghost comes to haunt Richard the night before the battle of Bosworth and to bless Richard&#8217;s opponent Richmond.</persdescription>

He does not realize that he is being co-opted into becoming a part of Richard&#8217;s plot, but is slowly convinced to come with his aldermen and ask Richard to take the throne. Whether he does so out of genuine conviction, out of opportunism at seeing which way the wind is turning, or out of fear, is unknown.</persdescription>

</persaliases>
<persdescription>The First Murderer is a reasonably cautious man, requiring a warrant to get to Clarence and commending Brankenbury on the wisdom of informing the King that he has handed Clarence over. He is a resolute man who intends to stiffen his companion&#8217;s spine, and does not give in to the hints of conscience that occasionally attack him. He enjoys toying with his victim, answering all of his pleas with the plainspoken assertion that he is going to die, and giving reasons for it. He comes up with the odd idea of drowning Clarence in a cask of wine. He is scornful of his companion&#8217;s attack of remorse, but happy to pocket the entire fee on his own, and intelligent enough to know to get out of the country as soon as possible once the deed is done.</persdescription>

</persaliases>
<persdescription>The Second Murderer is a blunt fellow who is less secure about his job than he would like. He is irritated about the fact that he has a conscience, but he has learned to control it, though it sometimes takes a while. The promise of gold always helps the process. Clarence speaking to him and his companion weakens his resolve, and he attempts to bolster himself by giving Clarence reasons why he deserves to die. Not wanting the man to die under an illusion, he lets him know that it is Richard who has sent them. He distracts Clarence in the oldest way to give the First Murderer a chance to stab him, but seeing Clarence dead truly bothers him and he runs off, refusing any part of the fee.</persdescription>

<scenepersonae>(Richard Duke of Gloucester, Clarence, Brakenbury, Lord Hastings)</scenepersonae>
<scenedescription>Richard Duke of Gloucester reflects on how little peacetime suits him, since his physical aspects prevents him from the pursuits of love. To occupy his time, he has therefore convinced his brother King Edward that their brother Clarence is dangerous. Clarence is brought in, being led to the Tower. Richard hypocritically blames the Queen and promises to give Clarence all the help he can. Clarence is taken away. Hasting, just released from jail, reports that the King is dangerously ill. Richard hopes his brother will die, but not before Clarence is done away with. He also plans to marry the Lady Anne, whose husband and father-in-law he both killed.</scenedescription>

<scenepersonae>(Queen Mother Elizabeth, Lord Rivers, Marquess of Dorset, Lord Grey, Buckingham, Lord Stanley, Richard Duke of Gloucester, Lord Hastings, Queen Margaret, Catesby, Murderers)</scenepersonae>
<scenedescription>The Queen is desperately worried about the King&#8217;s health, as in the event of his death Richard would be Regent, and he has no love for her or her family. Rivers and Grey try to reassure her. Buckingham announces that the King is better and is hoping to reconcile his brother and his wife. Richard and Hastings come in, and begin to quarrel over who started their quarrel. Richard openly defies the Queen and her family, scorning them for their lower-class roots. Old Queen Margaret, Henry VI&#8217;s widow, sneaks in, and listens to them quarrelling; finally she comes forward and curses them one by one for killing her husband and son, and stealing the throne. The others all gang up on her and she leaves, calling for a bad end on them all, except Buckingham, who is innocent of either murder. Buckingham refuses to pay any attention to her warning against Richard. A message from the King requests everyone&#8217;s presence, and they leave to go to him, except Richard, who gives two men a warrant to kill Clarence at the Tower.</scenedescription>

<scenelocation>London. The Tower.</scenelocation>
<scenepersonae>(Clarence, Keeper, Brakenbury, Murderers)</scenepersonae>
<scenedescription>Clarence tells his keeper of the terrible dream he had, in which he saw himself drown and accused after death of all the treasons he has committed. He keenly feels his guilt. The two murderers enter, showing their warrant to Brackenbury, the commander of the Tower, who does not want to know why they have come. The two murderers debate a little about going through with the deed, one of them being somewhat conscience-stricken at the idea, but remembering that they will be well-paid, they decide to go through with it. They wake Clarence, who tries to reason with them, but they throw his guilt in his face, inform him that their warrant is from the King, and when he begs them to go to Richard for help, tell him that it is Richard who sent them to kill him. They stab him and drag his body to another room to drown him in a barrel of wine. One of the murderers repents, and tells the other that he will not accept the fee for killing Clarence.</scenedescription>

<scenedescription>Clarence&#8217;s young children asks their grandmother the Duchess of York whether their father is dead; she insists that he is not. When Clarence&#8217;s son mentions Richard&#8217;s weeping when talking about Clarence, the Duchess comments that her son was almost certainly being hypocritical. She admits to loathing him. The Queen enters wailing, bearing the news of King Edward&#8217;s death. Richard arrives, speaking consolingly; he asks for his mother&#8217;s blessing, but she does not give a complete one. Buckingham suggests that the new King be fetched by a small number of people, to avoid worrying people that the civil wars might be starting up again.

<scenedescription>Richard, Buckingham and others escort the new King to London. The boy wishes his other uncles were with them, but Richard assures him that they were traitors. They expect to find the Queen and York waiting for them, but Hastings informs them that they have taken sanctuary. They send Cardinal Bourchier to bring York, overcoming his scruples about infringing sanctuary. Richard suggests to the King that he should spend the time until his coronation at the Tower. York arrives, and trades jokes with Richard, though he goes too far when he refers to Richard&#8217;s crooked back. Both children are suspicious of Richard, but they go to the Tower all the same, despite York&#8217;s fear of ghosts.

<scenedescription>The Lords meet in council to decide on a date for their new King&#8217;s coronation. Hastings presumes to speak for Richard, who is late. Richard arrives, and sends the Bishop of Ely to fetch him some strawberries. He asks the council what sentence should be passed on anyone caught conspiring against him, and Hastings suggests that death would be appropriate. Richard immediately accuses him of conspiring, claiming that Hastings has withered his arm through witchcraft, and condemns him to immediate execution. Hastings reflects on his own foolish sense of security and on Margaret&#8217;s curses. Ratcliffe and Lovel lead him to his death.</scenedescription>

<line form="verse">Made him my book, wherein my soul recorded</line>
<line form="verse">The history of all her secret thoughts.</line>
<line form="verse">So smooth he daub&#8217;d his vice with show of virtue</line>
<line form="verse">That, his apparent open guilt omitted&#8212;</line>

<line form="verse">Or that we would, against the form of law,</line>

<line form="verse">But that the extreme peril of the case,</line>

<line form="verse">Enforc&#8217;d us to this execution?</line>
</speech>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BUCK.</speaker>
<line form="verse">I never look&#8217;d for better at his hands</line>

<line form="verse">Until your lordship came to see his end,</line>
<line form="verse">Which now the loving haste of these our friends,</line>

<speaker>MAY.</speaker>
<line form="verse">But, my good lord, your Grace&#8217;s words shall serve</line>
<line form="verse">As well as I had seen, and heard him speak;</line>

<scenedescription>Buckingham reports to Richard that the citizens are reluctant to proclaim him King. The Mayor and his aldermen come to visit Richard, who quickly hides. Buckingham assures the Mayor that Richard is studying religion with a pair of priests. Buckingham and Catesby play a hypocritical game, insisting that Richard is worried at seeing such a crowd coming for him. When Richard enters, accompanied by two bishops, Buckingham urges him to seize the crown, but Richard refuses. Buckingham threatens to dethrone the entire family, and stalks out with the Mayor and his men. Richard has them called back and, insisting that it is entirely against his will, accepts to become King. He agrees to be crowned the next day and goes back in with the bishops.</scenedescription>

<line form="verse">You say that Edward is your brother&#8217;s son:</line>
<line form="verse">So say we too, but not by Edward&#8217;s wife;</line>
<line form="verse">For first was he contract to Lady Lucy&#8212;</line>
<line form="verse">Your mother lives a witness to his vow&#8212;</line>
<line form="verse">And afterward by substitute betroth&#8217;d</line>
<line form="verse">To Bona, sister to the King of France.</line>
<line form="verse">These both put off, a poor petitioner,</line>
<line form="verse">A care-craz&#8217;d mother to a many sons,</line>
<line form="verse">A beauty-waning and distressed widow,</line>
<line form="verse">Even in the afternoon of her best days,</line>
<line form="verse">Made prize and purchase of his wanton eye,</line>
<line form="verse">Seduc&#8217;d the pitch and height of his degree</line>
<line form="verse">To base declension and loath&#8217;d bigamy.</line>
<line form="verse">By her, in his unlawful bed, he got</line>
<line form="verse">This Edward, whom our manners call the Prince.</line>
<line form="verse">More bitterly could I expostulate,</line>
<line form="verse">Save that for reverence to some alive,</line>
<line form="verse">I give a sparing limit to my tongue.</line>

<scenedescription>The dowager Queen, accompanied by the Duchess of York and Lady Anne (who is now Richard&#8217;s wife) tries to be let into the Tower to see her children, but Brakenbury is forced to refuse them access, by Richard&#8217;s orders. Stanley arrives to summon Anne to her coronation as Queen. Stanlye and the Queen urge Dorset to escape England and join Richmond on the Continent. Lady Anne feels that she has brought her own misery upon herself, and is fairly certain that Richard will kill her soon. The Duchess offers her best hopes for them own, but there is little of it.</scenedescription>

<scenepersonae>(Richard, Buckingham, Catesby, Ratcliffe, Lovel, Page, Stanley, Sir James Tyrrel)</scenepersonae>
<scenedescription>Richard, in the full panoply of kingship, ascends his throne, and speaks to Buckingham alone, at first insinuating and then flat-out telling him that he wishes the two princes in the Tower to be killed.  Buckingham at first pretends not to understand, and then asks for time to think. Seeing that Buckingham is growing cautious, Richard resolves to no longer trust him, and sends a page to find a man who will obey unquestioningly. Stanley brings the news of Dorset&#8217;s flight. Richard sends Catesby to spread the rumor that Anne is fatally ill, as he has decided that for the safety of his crown he will have to marry his brother&#8217;s daughter. At the same time he intends to marry Clarence&#8217;s daughter to some poor gentleman of low rank, leaving her no threat to him. He finds his agent for murdering the princes in Sir James Tyrrel, who unhesitatingly agrees to do the deed. Buckingham returns to ask for the earldom he was promised. Richard refuses, and Buckingham, both insulted at Richard&#8217;s lack of gratitude and suddenly afraid of sharing Hastings&#8217;s fate, decides to flee.</scenedescription>

<scenedescription>Queen Margaret comes to witness the grief of her enemies. Queen Elizabeth and the Duchess of York come in, grieving over the death of their children/grandchildren. Margaret comes forth to remind them that they are not the only ones who have suffered. Together the women consider their woes and the need they have to curse. Margaret leaves for the final time. As Richard passes by with his army, his mother and sister-in-law accuse him of all his foul crimes, until he orders his drummers and trumpeters to drown them out. The Duchess of York gives him a mother&#8217;s curse, swearing never to see him again. After she leaves, Richard begins to speak to the dowager Queen about her daughter. Thinking he means to have her killed, she pleads for the girl&#8217;s life, but discovers that Richard wishes to marry her. She is horrified, but he argues with her just as he did with Anne; in the end, she appears to be won over. Richard is distracted as his various followers come in for news and instructions. Stanley brings news that Richmond has raised an army and is crossing over to England to claim the throne. Stanley offers to muster men, but Richard distrusts him and orders him to leave his son behind as a hostage. News of rebellion arrives from all corners of the kingdom, but soon there is also news that Buckingham has been defeated and captured. Richmond, however, has landed with his army.</scenedescription>

Richard wakes in a panic, thinking an assassin is near. He reflects on matters, realizing how alone he is, and beginning to feel the weight of his sins. He realizes that nobody, not even himself, can pity him. He prepares for battle with less confidence that he might have had. Richmond, meanwhile, wakes in high good spirits, having slept wonderfully well, and urges his soldiers to fight well, since their cause is just: the fight against tyranny. Norfolk tells Richard of a warning he received implying that Richard has been betrayed. Richard gives a speech to his soldiers, insulting the enemy as one easily defeated. Just as the battle is about to begin, he hears that Stanley has refused to join him. Needing to concentrate on the fight, he has no time to execute Stanley&#8217;s son.</scenedescription>

<line form="verse">For me, the ransom of my bold attempt</line>
<line form="verse">Shall be this cold corpse on the earth&#8217;s cold face;</line>
