<LINE>The newest state.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">This is the sergeant,</LINE>

<SPEAKER>SERG.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Doubtful it stood,</LINE>
<LINE>As two spent swimmers that do cling together</LINE>
<LINE>And choke their art. The merciless Macdonwald</LINE>
<LINE>(Worthy to be a rebel, for to that</LINE>
<LINE>The multiplying villainies of nature</LINE>
<LINE>Do swarm upon him) from the Western Isles</LINE>
<LINE>Of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied,</LINE>
<LINE>And Fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,</LINE>
<LINE>Show&#8217;d like a rebel&#8217;s whore. But all&#8217;s too weak;</LINE>
<LINE>For brave Macbeth (well he deserves that name),</LINE>
<LINE>Disdaining Fortune, with his brandish&#8217;d steel,</LINE>
<LINE>Which smok&#8217;d with bloody execution,</LINE>
<LINE>(Like Valor&#8217;s minion) carv&#8217;d out his passage</LINE>
<LINE>Till he fac&#8217;d the slave;</LINE>
<LINE>Which nev&#8217;r shook hands, nor bade farewell to him,</LINE>
<LINE>Till he unseam&#8217;d him from the nave to th&#8217; chops,</LINE>

<LINE>O valiant cousin, worthy gentleman!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SERG.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As whence the sun gins his reflection</LINE>
<LINE>Shipwracking storms and direful thunders break,</LINE>

<LINE>No sooner justice had, with valor arm&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Compell&#8217;d these skipping kerns to trust their heels,</LINE>

<LINE offset="9">Yes,</LINE>

<LINE>If I say sooth, I must report they were</LINE>
<LINE>As cannons overcharg&#8217;d with double cracks, so they</LINE>
<LINE>Doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe.</LINE>
<LINE>Except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSSE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">From Fife, great King,</LINE>
<LINE>Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky</LINE>
<LINE>And fan our people cold.</LINE>
<LINE>Norway himself, with terrible numbers,</LINE>
<LINE>Assisted by that most disloyal traitor,</LINE>
<LINE>The Thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict,</LINE>
<LINE>Till that Bellona&#8217;s bridegroom, lapp&#8217;d in proof,</LINE>
<LINE>Confronted him with self-comparisons,</LINE>
<LINE>Point against point, rebellious arm &#8217;gainst arm,</LINE>
<LINE>Curbing his lavish spirit; and to conclude,</LINE>
<LINE>The victory fell on us.</LINE>

<LINE>Ten thousand dollars to our general use.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>I&#8217; th&#8217; shipman&#8217;s card.</LINE>

<LINE>How far is&#8217;t call&#8217;d to Forres? What are these</LINE>

<LINE>That man may question? You seem to understand me,</LINE>

<LINE>Upon her skinny lips. You should be women,</LINE>

<SPEAKER>BAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good sir, why do you start, and seem to fear</LINE>
<LINE>Things that do sound so fair?&#8212;I&#8217; th&#8217; name of truth,</LINE>
<LINE>Are ye fantastical, or that indeed</LINE>
<LINE>Which outwardly ye show? My noble partner</LINE>
<LINE>You greet with present grace, and great prediction</LINE>
<LINE>Of noble having and of royal hope,</LINE>
<LINE>That he seems rapt withal; to me you speak not.</LINE>
<LINE>If you can look into the seeds of time,</LINE>
<LINE>And say which grain will grow, and which will not,</LINE>
<LINE>Speak then to me, who neither beg nor fear</LINE>
<LINE>Your favors nor your hate.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>MACB.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Stay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more:</LINE>
<LINE>By Sinel&#8217;s death I know I am Thane of Glamis,</LINE>
<LINE>But how of Cawdor? The Thane of Cawdor lives</LINE>
<LINE>A prosperous gentleman; and to be king</LINE>
<LINE>Stands not within the prospect of belief,</LINE>
<LINE>No more than to be Cawdor. Say from whence</LINE>
<LINE>You owe this strange intelligence, or why</LINE>
<LINE>Upon this blasted heath you stop our way</LINE>
<LINE>With such prophetic greeting? Speak, I charge you.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSSE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The King hath happily receiv&#8217;d, Macbeth,</LINE>
<LINE>The news of thy success; and when he reads</LINE>
<LINE>Thy personal venture in the rebels&#8217; fight,</LINE>
<LINE>His wonders and his praises do contend</LINE>

<LINE>He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks,</LINE>
<LINE>Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make,</LINE>
<LINE>Strange images of death. As thick as tale</LINE>
<LINE>Came post with post, and every one did bear</LINE>
<LINE>Thy praises in his kingdom&#8217;s great defense,</LINE>

<SPEAKER>ROSSE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And for an earnest of a greater honor,</LINE>

<SPEAKER>ANG.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Who was the thane lives yet,</LINE>
<LINE>But under heavy judgment bears that life</LINE>

<LINE>With hidden help and vantage, or that with both</LINE>
<LINE>He labor&#8217;d in his country&#8217;s wrack, I know not;</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Aside to Macbeth.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE offset="5">That, trusted home,</LINE>
<LINE>Might yet enkindle you unto the crown,</LINE>
<LINE>Besides the Thane of Cawdor. But &#8217;tis strange;</LINE>
<LINE>And oftentimes, to win us to our harm,</LINE>
<LINE>The instruments of darkness tell us truths,</LINE>
<LINE>Win us with honest trifles, to betray &#8217;s</LINE>

<LINE>This supernatural soliciting</LINE>
<LINE>Cannot be ill; cannot be good. If ill,</LINE>
<LINE>Why hath it given me earnest of success,</LINE>
<LINE>Commencing in a truth? I am Thane of Cawdor.</LINE>
<LINE>If good, why do I yield to that suggestion</LINE>
<LINE>Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair</LINE>
<LINE>And make my seated heart knock at my ribs,</LINE>
<LINE>Against the use of nature? Present fears</LINE>
<LINE>Are less than horrible imaginings:</LINE>
<LINE>My thought, whose murder yet is but fantastical,</LINE>
<LINE>Shakes so my single state of man that function</LINE>
<LINE>Is smother&#8217;d in surmise, and nothing is</LINE>

<LINE offset="7">My liege,</LINE>
<LINE>They are not yet come back. But I have spoke</LINE>
<LINE>With one that saw him die; who did report</LINE>
<LINE>That very frankly he confess&#8217;d his treasons,</LINE>
<LINE>Implor&#8217;d your Highness&#8217; pardon, and set forth</LINE>
<LINE>A deep repentance. Nothing in his life</LINE>
<LINE>Became him like the leaving it. He died</LINE>
<LINE>As one that had been studied in his death,</LINE>
<LINE>To throw away the dearest thing he ow&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>As &#8217;twere a careless trifle.</LINE>

<LINE offset="5">There&#8217;s no art</LINE>

<LINE>He was a gentleman on whom I built</LINE>
<LINE>An absolute trust.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Macbeth, Banquo, Rosse, and Angus.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE offset="4">O worthiest cousin!</LINE>
<LINE>The sin of my ingratitude even now</LINE>
<LINE>Was heavy on me. Thou art so far before,</LINE>
<LINE>That swiftest wing of recompense is slow</LINE>
<LINE>To overtake thee. Would thou hadst less deserv&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>That the proportion both of thanks and payment</LINE>
<LINE>Might have been mine! Only I have left to say,</LINE>
<LINE>More is thy due than more than all can pay.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>DUN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">Welcome hither!</LINE>
<LINE>I have begun to plant thee, and will labor</LINE>
<LINE>To make thee full of growing. Noble Banquo,</LINE>
<LINE>That hast no less deserv&#8217;d, nor must be known</LINE>
<LINE>No less to have done so, let me infold thee</LINE>

<LINE>And you whose places are the nearest, know</LINE>
<LINE>We will establish our estate upon</LINE>
<LINE>Our eldest, Malcolm, whom we name hereafter</LINE>
<LINE>The Prince of Cumberland; which honor must</LINE>
<LINE>Not unaccompanied invest him only,</LINE>

<LINE>The rest is labor, which is not us&#8217;d for you.</LINE>

<LINE><RECITE>&#8220;They met me in the day of success; and I have learn&#8217;d by the perfect&#8217;st report, they have more in them than mortal knowledge. When I burnt in desire to question them further, they made themselves air, into which they vanish&#8217;d. Whiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it, came missives from the King, who all-hail&#8217;d me &#8220;Thane of Cawdor,&#8221; by which title, before, these we&#239;rd sisters saluted me, and referr&#8217;d me to the coming on of time with &#8220;Hail, King that shalt be!&#8221; This have I thought good to deliver thee, my dearest partner of greatness, that thou mightst not lose the dues of rejoicing by being ignorant of what greatness is promis&#8217;d thee. Lay it to thy heart, and farewell.&#8221;</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE>Glamis thou art, and Cawdor, and shalt be</LINE>
<LINE>What thou art promis&#8217;d. Yet do I fear thy nature,</LINE>
<LINE>It is too full  o&#8217; th&#8217; milk of human kindness</LINE>
<LINE>To catch the nearest way. Thou wouldst be great,</LINE>
<LINE>Art not without ambition, but without</LINE>
<LINE>The illness should attend it. What thou wouldst highly,</LINE>
<LINE>That wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false,</LINE>
<LINE>And yet wouldst wrongly win. Thou&#8217;ldst have, great Glamis,</LINE>
<LINE>That which cries, &#8220;Thus thou must do,&#8221; if thou have it;</LINE>
<LINE>And that which rather thou dost fear to do</LINE>
<LINE>Than wishest should be undone. Hie thee hither,</LINE>
<LINE>That I may pour my spirits in thine ear,</LINE>
<LINE>And chastise with the valor of my tongue</LINE>
<LINE>All that impedes thee from the golden round,</LINE>
<LINE>Which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem</LINE>

<LINE>Under my battlements. Come, you spirits</LINE>
<LINE>That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here,</LINE>
<LINE>And fill me from the crown to the toe topful</LINE>
<LINE>Of direst cruelty! Make thick my blood,</LINE>
<LINE>Stop up th&#8217; access and passage to remorse,</LINE>
<LINE>That no compunctious visitings of nature</LINE>
<LINE>Shake my fell purpose, nor keep peace between</LINE>
<LINE>Th&#8217; effect and it! Come to my woman&#8217;s breasts,</LINE>
<LINE>And take my milk for gall, you murth&#8217;ring ministers,</LINE>
<LINE>Wherever in your sightless substances</LINE>
<LINE>You wait on nature&#8217;s mischief! Come, thick night,</LINE>
<LINE>And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell,</LINE>
<LINE>That my keen knife see not the wound it makes,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark</LINE>
<LINE>To cry, &#8220;Hold, hold!&#8221;</LINE>

<LINE>If it were done, when &#8217;tis done, then &#8217;twere well</LINE>
<LINE>It were done quickly. If th&#8217; assassination</LINE>
<LINE>Could trammel up the consequence, and catch</LINE>
<LINE>With his surcease, success; that but this blow</LINE>
<LINE>Might be the be-all and the end-all&#8212;here,</LINE>
<LINE>But here, upon this bank and shoal of time,</LINE>
<LINE>We&#8217;ld jump the life to come. But in these cases</LINE>
<LINE>We still have judgment here, that we but teach</LINE>
<LINE>Bloody instructions, which, being taught, return</LINE>
<LINE>To plague th&#8217; inventor. This even-handed justice</LINE>
<LINE>Commends th&#8217; ingredience of our poison&#8217;d chalice</LINE>
<LINE>To our own lips. He&#8217;s here in double trust:</LINE>
<LINE>First, as I am his kinsman and his subject,</LINE>
<LINE>Strong both against the deed; then, as his host,</LINE>
<LINE>Who should against his murderer shut the door,</LINE>
<LINE>Not bear the knife myself. Besides, this Duncan</LINE>
<LINE>Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been</LINE>
<LINE>So clear in his great office, that his virtues</LINE>
<LINE>Will plead like angels, trumpet-tongu&#8217;d, against</LINE>

<LINE>Upon the sightless couriers of the air,</LINE>

<LINE>When you durst do it, then you were a man;</LINE>
<LINE>And to be more than what you were, you would</LINE>
<LINE>Be so much more the man. Nor time, nor place,</LINE>
<LINE>Did then adhere, and yet you would make both:</LINE>
<LINE>They have made themselves, and that their fitness now</LINE>
<LINE>Does unmake you. I have given suck, and know</LINE>
<LINE>How tender &#8217;tis to love the babe that milks me;</LINE>
<LINE>I would, while it was smiling in my face,</LINE>
<LINE>Have pluck&#8217;d my nipple from his boneless gums,</LINE>

<LINE>Will I with wine and wassail so convince,</LINE>
<LINE>That memory, the warder of the brain,</LINE>
<LINE>Shall be a fume, and the receipt of reason</LINE>
<LINE>A limbeck only. When in swinish sleep</LINE>

<LINE>What cannot you and I perform upon</LINE>
<LINE>Th&#8217; unguarded Duncan? What not put upon</LINE>

<LINE>I have thee not, and yet I see thee still.</LINE>
<LINE>Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible</LINE>
<LINE>To feeling as to sight? Or art thou but</LINE>
<LINE>A dagger of the mind, a false creation,</LINE>
<LINE>Proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?</LINE>
<LINE>I see thee yet, in form as palpable</LINE>
<LINE>As this which now I draw.</LINE>
<LINE>Thou marshal&#8217;st me the way that I was going,</LINE>
<LINE>And such an instrument I was to use.</LINE>
<LINE>Mine eyes are made the fools  o&#8217; th&#8217; other senses,</LINE>
<LINE>Or else worth all the rest. I see thee still;</LINE>
<LINE>And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood,</LINE>
<LINE>Which was not so before. There&#8217;s no such thing:</LINE>
<LINE>It is the bloody business which informs</LINE>
<LINE>Thus to mine eyes. Now  o&#8217;er the one half world</LINE>
<LINE>Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse</LINE>
<LINE>The curtain&#8217;d sleep; witchcraft celebrates</LINE>
<LINE>Pale Hecat&#8217;s off&#8217;rings; and wither&#8217;d Murder,</LINE>
<LINE>Alarum&#8217;d by his sentinel, the wolf,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose howl&#8217;s his watch, thus with his stealthy pace,</LINE>
<LINE>With Tarquin&#8217;s ravishing strides, towards his design</LINE>
<LINE>Moves like a ghost. Thou sure and firm-set earth,</LINE>
<LINE>Hear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear</LINE>
<LINE>The very stones prate of my whereabout,</LINE>
<LINE>And take the present horror from the time,</LINE>
<LINE>Which now suits with it. Whiles I threat, he lives:</LINE>
<LINE>Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>A bell rings.</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>I go, and it is done; the bell invites me.</LINE>
<LINE>Hear it not, Duncan, for it is a knell,</LINE>
<LINE>That summons thee to heaven or to hell.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>LADY M.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That which hath made them drunk hath made me bold;</LINE>
<LINE>What hath quench&#8217;d them hath given me fire. Hark! Peace!</LINE>
<LINE>It was the owl that shriek&#8217;d, the fatal bellman,</LINE>
<LINE>Which gives the stern&#8217;st good-night. He is about it:</LINE>
<LINE>The doors are open; and the surfeited grooms</LINE>
<LINE>Do mock their charge with snores. I have drugg&#8217;d their possets,</LINE>

<LINE>Alack, I am afraid they have awak&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>And &#8217;tis not done; th&#8217; attempt, and not the deed,</LINE>
<LINE>Confounds us. Hark! I laid their daggers ready,</LINE>

<LINE>There&#8217;s one did laugh in &#8217;s sleep, and one cried, &#8220;Murder!&#8221;</LINE>
<LINE>That they did wake each other. I stood and heard them;</LINE>

<SPEAKER>LADY M.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="3">There are two lodg&#8217;d together.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>MACB.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>One cried, &#8220;God bless us!&#8221; and &#8220;Amen!&#8221; the other,</LINE>

<LINE>List&#8217;ning their fear, I could not say &#8220;Amen,&#8221;</LINE>

<LINE>Stuck in my throat.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>Methought I heard a voice cry, &#8220;Sleep no more!</LINE>
<LINE>Macbeth does murder sleep&#8221;&#8212;the innocent sleep,</LINE>
<LINE>Sleep that knits up the ravell&#8217;d sleave of care,</LINE>
<LINE>The death of each day&#8217;s life, sore labor&#8217;s bath,</LINE>

<SPEAKER>LADY M.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who was it that thus cried? Why, worthy thane,</LINE>
<LINE>You do unbend your noble strength, to think</LINE>
<LINE>So brain-sickly of things. Go get some water,</LINE>
<LINE>And wash this filthy witness from your hand.</LINE>
<LINE>Why did you bring these daggers from the place?</LINE>
<LINE>They must lie there. Go carry them, and smear</LINE>
<LINE>The sleepy grooms with blood.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACB.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">I&#8217;ll go no more.</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE offset="5">Infirm of purpose!</LINE>
<LINE>Give me the daggers. The sleeping and the dead</LINE>

<LINE>I&#8217;ll gild the faces of the grooms withal,</LINE>

<LINE>What hands are here? Hah! They pluck out mine eyes.</LINE>
<LINE>Will all great Neptune&#8217;s ocean wash this blood</LINE>

<LINE>Knock, knock, knock! Who&#8217;s there, i&#8217; th&#8217; name of Belzebub? Here&#8217;s a farmer, that hang&#8217;d himself on th&#8217; expectation of plenty. Come in time! Have napkins enow about you, here You&#8217;ll sweat for&#8217;t.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Knock.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Knock, knock! Who&#8217;s there, in th&#8217; other devil&#8217;s name? Faith, here&#8217;s an equivocator, that could swear in both the scales against either scale, who committed treason enough for God&#8217;s sake, yet could not equivocate to heaven. O, come in, equivocator.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Knock.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Knock, knock, knock! Who&#8217;s there? Faith, here&#8217;s an English tailor come hither for stealing out of a French hose. Come in, tailor, here you may roast your goose.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Knock.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Knock, knock! Never at quiet! What are you? But this place is too cold for hell. I&#8217;ll devil&#8212;porter it no further. I had thought to have let in some of all professions that go the primrose way to th&#8217; everlasting bonfire.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PORT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Faith, sir, we were carousing till the second cock; and drink, sir, is a great provoker of three things.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What three things does drink especially provoke?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PORT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, sir, nose-painting, sleep, and urine. Lechery, sir, it provokes, and unprovokes: it provokes the desire, but it takes away the performance. Therefore much drink may be said to be an equivocator with lechery: it makes him, and it mars him; it sets him on, and it takes him off; it persuades him, and disheartens him; makes him stand to, and not stand to; in conclusion, equivocates him in a sleep, and giving him the lie, leaves him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I believe drink gave thee the lie last night.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PORT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That it did, sir, i&#8217; the very throat on me; but I requited him for his lie, and (I think) being too strong for him, though he took up my legs sometime, yet I made a shift to cast him.</LINE>

<LINE>And prophesying, with accents terrible,</LINE>
<LINE>Of dire combustion and confus&#8217;d events</LINE>
<LINE>New hatch&#8217;d to th&#8217; woeful time. The obscure bird</LINE>

<LINE>Those of his chamber, as it seem&#8217;d, had done&#8217;t.</LINE>
<LINE>Their hands and faces were all badg&#8217;d with blood;</LINE>
<LINE>So were their daggers, which unwip&#8217;d we found</LINE>
<LINE>Upon their pillows. They star&#8217;d and were distracted;</LINE>

<LINE>Steep&#8217;d in the colors of their trade, their daggers</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSSE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">Ha, good father,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou seest the heavens, as troubled with man&#8217;s act,</LINE>
<LINE>Threatens his bloody stage. By th&#8217; clock &#8217;tis day,</LINE>
<LINE>And yet dark night strangles the travelling lamp.</LINE>
<LINE>Is&#8217;t night&#8217;s predominance, or the day&#8217;s shame,</LINE>
<LINE>That darkness does the face of earth entomb,</LINE>
<LINE>When living light should kiss it?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLD MAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">&#8217;Tis unnatural,</LINE>
<LINE>Even like the deed that&#8217;s done. On Tuesday last,</LINE>
<LINE>A falcon, tow&#8217;ring in her pride of place,</LINE>
<LINE>Was by a mousing owl hawk&#8217;d at, and kill&#8217;d.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSSE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And Duncan&#8217;s horses (a thing most strange and certain),</LINE>
<LINE>Beauteous and swift, the minions of their race,</LINE>
<LINE>Turn&#8217;d wild in nature, broke their stalls, flung out,</LINE>

<LINE offset="7">They were suborned.</LINE>
<LINE>Malcolm and Donalbain, the King&#8217;s two sons,</LINE>

<LINE offset="4">To be thus is nothing,</LINE>
<LINE>But to be safely thus. Our fears in Banquo</LINE>
<LINE>Stick deep, and in his royalty of nature</LINE>
<LINE>Reigns that which would be fear&#8217;d. &#8217;Tis much he dares,</LINE>
<LINE>And to that dauntless temper of his mind,</LINE>
<LINE>He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valor</LINE>
<LINE>To act in safety. There is none but he</LINE>
<LINE>Whose being I do fear; and under him</LINE>
<LINE>My Genius is rebuk&#8217;d, as it is said</LINE>
<LINE>Mark Antony&#8217;s was by Caesar. He chid the sisters</LINE>
<LINE>When first they put the name of king upon me,</LINE>
<LINE>And bade them speak to him; then prophet-like</LINE>
<LINE>They hail&#8217;d him father to a line of kings.</LINE>
<LINE>Upon my head they plac&#8217;d a fruitless crown,</LINE>
<LINE>And put a barren sceptre in my gripe,</LINE>
<LINE>Thence to be wrench&#8217;d with an unlineal hand,</LINE>
<LINE>No son of mine succeeding. If&#8217;t be so,</LINE>
<LINE>For Banquo&#8217;s issue have I fil&#8217;d my mind,</LINE>
<LINE>For them the gracious Duncan have I murder&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Put rancors in the vessel of my peace</LINE>
<LINE>Only for them, and mine eternal jewel</LINE>
<LINE>Given to the common enemy of man,</LINE>
<LINE>To make them kings&#8212;the seeds of Banquo kings!</LINE>
<LINE>Rather than so, come fate into the list,</LINE>
<LINE>And champion me to th&#8217; utterance! Who&#8217;s there?</LINE>

<SPEAKER>MACB.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">Well then, now</LINE>
<LINE>Have you consider&#8217;d of my speeches?&#8212;know</LINE>
<LINE>That it was he in the times past which held you</LINE>
<LINE>So under fortune, which you thought had been</LINE>
<LINE>Our innocent self? This I made good to you</LINE>
<LINE>In our last conference, pass&#8217;d in probation with you:</LINE>
<LINE>How you were borne in hand, how cross&#8217;d, the instruments,</LINE>
<LINE>Who wrought with them, and all things else that might</LINE>
<LINE>To half a soul and to a notion craz&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>Say, &#8220;Thus did Banquo.&#8221;</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. MUR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">You made it known to us.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACB.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I did so; and went further, which is now</LINE>
<LINE>Our point of second meeting. Do you find</LINE>
<LINE>Your patience so predominant in your nature</LINE>
<LINE>That you can let this go? Are you so gospell&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>To pray for this good man, and for his issue,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose heavy hand hath bow&#8217;d you to the grave,</LINE>
<LINE>And beggar&#8217;d yours forever?</LINE>

<SPEAKER>1. MUR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">We are men, my liege.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACB.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, in the catalogue ye go for men,</LINE>
<LINE>As hounds and greyhounds, mungrels, spaniels, curs,</LINE>
<LINE>Shoughs, water-rugs, and demi-wolves are clipt</LINE>
<LINE>All by the name of dogs; the valued file</LINE>
<LINE>Distinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle,</LINE>
<LINE>The house-keeper, the hunter, every one,</LINE>
<LINE>According to the gift which bounteous nature</LINE>
<LINE>Hath in him clos&#8217;d; whereby he does receive</LINE>
<LINE>Particular addition, from the bill</LINE>
<LINE>That writes them all alike: and so of men.</LINE>
<LINE>Now, if you have a station in the file,</LINE>
<LINE>Not i&#8217; th&#8217; worst rank of manhood, say&#8217;t,</LINE>
<LINE>And I will put that business in your bosoms,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose execution takes your enemy off,</LINE>
<LINE>Grapples you to the heart and love of us,</LINE>
<LINE>Who wear our health but sickly in his life,</LINE>
<LINE>Which in his death were perfect.</LINE>

<LINE offset="7">I am one, my liege,</LINE>
<LINE>Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world</LINE>

<LINE>I do to spite the world.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. MUR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">And I another,</LINE>
<LINE>So weary with disasters, tugg&#8217;d with fortune,</LINE>
<LINE>That I would set my life on any chance,</LINE>
<LINE>To mend it, or be rid on&#8217;t.</LINE>

<LINE offset="5">Both of you</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BOTH 1. MUR. AND 2. MUR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">True, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACB.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So is he mine; and in such bloody distance,</LINE>
<LINE>That every minute of his being thrusts</LINE>
<LINE>Against my near&#8217;st of life; and though I could</LINE>
<LINE>With barefac&#8217;d power sweep him from my sight,</LINE>
<LINE>And bid my will avouch it, yet I must not,</LINE>
<LINE>For certain friends that are both his and mine,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose loves I may not drop, but wail his fall</LINE>
<LINE>Who I myself struck down. And thence it is</LINE>
<LINE>That I to your assistance do make love,</LINE>
<LINE>Masking the business from the common eye</LINE>
<LINE>For sundry weighty reasons.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. MUR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">We shall, my lord,</LINE>
<LINE>Perform what you command us.</LINE>

<LINE>The moment on&#8217;t, for&#8217;t must be done tonight,</LINE>
<LINE>And something from the palace; always thought</LINE>
<LINE>That I require a clearness: and with him&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>To leave no rubs nor botches in the work&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Fleance his son, that keeps him company,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose absence is no less material to me</LINE>
<LINE>Than is his father&#8217;s, must embrace the fate</LINE>
<LINE>Of that dark hour. Resolve yourselves apart,</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll come to you anon.</LINE>

<LINE>How now, my lord, why do you keep alone,</LINE>
<LINE>Of sorriest fancies your companions making,</LINE>
<LINE>Using those thoughts which should indeed have died</LINE>
<LINE>With them they think on? Things without all remedy</LINE>

<LINE>But let the frame of things disjoint, both the worlds suffer,</LINE>
<LINE>Ere we will eat our meal in fear, and sleep</LINE>
<LINE>In the affliction of these terrible dreams</LINE>
<LINE>That shake us nightly. Better be with the dead,</LINE>
<LINE>Whom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace,</LINE>
<LINE>Than on the torture of the mind to lie</LINE>
<LINE>In restless ecstasy. Duncan is in his grave;</LINE>
<LINE>After life&#8217;s fitful fever he sleeps well.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>MACB.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So shall I, love, and so, I pray, be you.</LINE>
<LINE>Let your remembrance apply to Banquo,</LINE>

<LINE>Good things of day begin to droop and drowse,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My former speeches have but hit your thoughts,</LINE>
<LINE>Which can interpret farther; only I say</LINE>
<LINE>Things have been strangely borne. The gracious Duncan</LINE>
<LINE>Was pitied of Macbeth; marry, he was dead.</LINE>
<LINE>And the right valiant Banquo walk&#8217;d too late,</LINE>
<LINE>Whom you may say (if&#8217;t please you) Fleance kill&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>For Fleance fled. Men must not walk too late.</LINE>
<LINE>Who cannot want the thought, how monstrous</LINE>
<LINE>It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain</LINE>
<LINE>To kill their gracious father? Damned fact!</LINE>
<LINE>How it did grieve Macbeth! Did he not straight</LINE>
<LINE>In pious rage the two delinquents tear,</LINE>
<LINE>That were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep?</LINE>
<LINE>Was not that nobly done? Ay, and wisely too;</LINE>
<LINE>For &#8217;twould have anger&#8217;d any heart alive</LINE>
<LINE>To hear the men deny&#8217;t. So that, I say,</LINE>
<LINE>He has borne all things well, and I do think</LINE>
<LINE>That had he Duncan&#8217;s sons under his key</LINE>
<LINE>(As, and&#8217;t please heaven, he shall not), they should find</LINE>
<LINE>What &#8217;twere to kill a father; so should Fleance.</LINE>
<LINE>But peace! For from broad words, and &#8217;cause he fail&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>His presence at the tyrant&#8217;s feast, I hear</LINE>
<LINE>Macduff lives in disgrace. Sir, can you tell</LINE>
<LINE>Where he bestows himself?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD.</SPEAKER>

<LINE>Of the most pious Edward with such grace</LINE>
<LINE>That the malevolence of fortune nothing</LINE>
<LINE>Takes from his high respect. Thither Macduff</LINE>
<LINE>Is gone to pray the holy king, upon his aid</LINE>
<LINE>To wake Northumberland and warlike Siward,</LINE>
<LINE>That by the help of these (with Him above</LINE>
<LINE>To ratify the work) we may again</LINE>
<LINE>Give to our tables meat, sleep to our nights;</LINE>
<LINE>Free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives;</LINE>
<LINE>Do faithful homage and receive free honors;</LINE>

<LINE offset="6">You know not</LINE>
<LINE>Whether it was his wisdom or his fear.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>L. MACD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Wisdom? To leave his wife, to leave his babes,</LINE>
<LINE>His mansion and his titles, in a place</LINE>

<LINE>He wants the natural touch; for the poor wren,</LINE>
<LINE>The most diminutive of birds, will fight,</LINE>
<LINE>Her young ones in her nest, against the owl.</LINE>
<LINE>All is the fear, and nothing is the love;</LINE>

<LINE>But cruel are the times when we are traitors,</LINE>
<LINE>And do not know ourselves; when we hold rumor</LINE>
<LINE>From what we fear, yet know not what we fear,</LINE>
<LINE>But float upon a wild and violent sea</LINE>
<LINE>Each way, and move. I take my leave of you;</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Shall not be long but I&#8217;ll be here again.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Bleed, bleed, poor country!</LINE>
<LINE>Great tyranny, lay thou thy basis sure,</LINE>
<LINE>For goodness dare not check thee; wear thou thy wrongs,</LINE>
<LINE>The title is affeer&#8217;d! Fare thee well, lord,</LINE>
<LINE>I would not be the villain that thou think&#8217;st</LINE>
<LINE>For the whole space that&#8217;s in the tyrant&#8217;s grasp,</LINE>
<LINE>And the rich East to boot.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Be not offended;</LINE>
<LINE>I speak not as in absolute fear of you.</LINE>
<LINE>I think our country sinks beneath the yoke:</LINE>
<LINE>It weeps, it bleeds, and each new day a gash</LINE>
<LINE>Is added to her wounds. I think withal</LINE>
<LINE>There would be hands uplifted in my right;</LINE>
<LINE>And here from gracious England have I offer</LINE>
<LINE>Of goodly thousands. But, for all this,</LINE>
<LINE>When I shall tread upon the tyrant&#8217;s head,</LINE>
<LINE>Or wear it on my sword, yet my poor country</LINE>
<LINE>Shall have more vices than it had before,</LINE>
<LINE>More suffer, and more sundry ways than ever,</LINE>
<LINE>By him that shall succeed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">What should he be?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is myself I mean; in whom I know</LINE>
<LINE>All the particulars of vice so grafted</LINE>
<LINE>That, when they shall be open&#8217;d, black Macbeth</LINE>
<LINE>Will seem as pure as snow, and the poor state</LINE>
<LINE>Esteem him as a lamb, being compar&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>With my confineless harms.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Not in the legions</LINE>
<LINE>Of horrid hell can come a devil more damn&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>In evils to top Macbeth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">I grant him bloody,</LINE>
<LINE>Luxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful,</LINE>
<LINE>Sudden, malicious, smacking of every sin</LINE>
<LINE>That has a name; but there&#8217;s no bottom, none,</LINE>
<LINE>In my voluptuousness. Your wives, your daughters,</LINE>
<LINE>Your matrons, and your maids could not fill up</LINE>
<LINE>The cestern of my lust, and my desire</LINE>
<LINE>All continent impediments would  o&#8217;erbear</LINE>
<LINE>That did oppose my will. Better Macbeth</LINE>
<LINE>Than such an one to reign.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Boundless intemperance</LINE>
<LINE>In nature is a tyranny; it hath been</LINE>
<LINE>Th&#8217; untimely emptying of the happy throne,</LINE>
<LINE>And fall of many kings. But fear not yet</LINE>
<LINE>To take upon you what is yours. You may</LINE>
<LINE>Convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty,</LINE>
<LINE>And yet seem cold, the time you may so hoodwink.</LINE>
<LINE>We have willing dames enough; there cannot be</LINE>
<LINE>That vulture in you to devour so many</LINE>
<LINE>As will to greatness dedicate themselves,</LINE>
<LINE>Finding it so inclin&#8217;d.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">With this, there grows</LINE>
<LINE>In my most ill-compos&#8217;d affection such</LINE>
<LINE>A stanchless avarice that, were I king,</LINE>
<LINE>I should cut off the nobles for their lands,</LINE>
<LINE>Desire his jewels, and this other&#8217;s house,</LINE>
<LINE>And my more-having would be as a sauce</LINE>
<LINE>To make me hunger more, that I should forge</LINE>
<LINE>Quarrels unjust against the good and loyal,</LINE>
<LINE>Destroying them for wealth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">This avarice</LINE>
<LINE>Sticks deeper, grows with more pernicious root</LINE>
<LINE>Than summer-seeming lust; and it hath been</LINE>
<LINE>The sword of our slain kings. Yet do not fear,</LINE>
<LINE>Scotland hath foisons to fill up your will</LINE>
<LINE>Of your mere own. All these are portable,</LINE>
<LINE>With other graces weigh&#8217;d.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But I have none. The king-becoming graces,</LINE>
<LINE>As justice, verity, temp&#8217;rance, stableness,</LINE>
<LINE>Bounty, perseverance, mercy, lowliness,</LINE>
<LINE>Devotion, patience, courage, fortitude,</LINE>
<LINE>I have no relish of them, but abound</LINE>
<LINE>In the division of each several crime,</LINE>
<LINE>Acting it many ways. Nay, had I pow&#8217;r, I should</LINE>
<LINE>Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell,</LINE>
<LINE>Uproar the universal peace, confound</LINE>
<LINE>All unity on earth.</LINE>

<LINE>I am as I have spoken.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>MACD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Fit to govern?</LINE>
<LINE>No, not to live. O nation miserable!</LINE>
<LINE>With an untitled tyrant bloody-sceptred,</LINE>
<LINE>When shalt thou see thy wholesome days again,</LINE>
<LINE>Since that the truest issue of thy throne</LINE>
<LINE>By his own interdiction stands accus&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>And does blaspheme his breed? Thy royal father</LINE>
<LINE>Was a most sainted king; the queen that bore thee,</LINE>
<LINE>Oft&#8217;ner upon her knees than on her feet,</LINE>
<LINE>Died every day she liv&#8217;d. Fare thee well,</LINE>
<LINE>These evils thou repeat&#8217;st upon thyself</LINE>
<LINE>Hath banish&#8217;d me from Scotland. O my breast,</LINE>
<LINE>Thy hope ends here!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Macduff, this noble passion,</LINE>
<LINE>Child of integrity, hath from my soul</LINE>
<LINE>Wip&#8217;d the black scruples, reconcil&#8217;d my thoughts</LINE>
<LINE>To thy good truth and honor. Devilish Macbeth</LINE>
<LINE>By many of these trains hath sought to win me</LINE>
<LINE>Into his power, and modest wisdom plucks me</LINE>
<LINE>From over-credulous haste. But God above</LINE>
<LINE>Deal between thee and me! For even now</LINE>
<LINE>I put myself to thy direction, and</LINE>
<LINE>Unspeak mine own detraction; here abjure</LINE>
<LINE>The taints and blames I laid upon myself,</LINE>
<LINE>For strangers to my nature. I am yet</LINE>
<LINE>Unknown to woman, never was forsworn,</LINE>
<LINE>Scarcely have coveted what was mine own,</LINE>
<LINE>At no time broke my faith, would not betray</LINE>
<LINE>The devil to his fellow, and delight</LINE>
<LINE>No less in truth than life. My first false speaking</LINE>
<LINE>Was this upon myself. What I am truly</LINE>
<LINE>Is thine and my poor country&#8217;s to command:</LINE>
<LINE>Whither indeed, before thy here-approach,</LINE>
<LINE>Old Siward, with ten thousand warlike men</LINE>
<LINE>Already at a point, was setting forth.</LINE>
<LINE>Now we&#8217;ll together, and the chance of goodness</LINE>
<LINE>Be like our warranted quarrel! Why are you silent?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACD.</SPEAKER>

<LINE>Well, more anon.&#8212;Comes the King forth, I pray you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOCT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, sir; there are a crew of wretched souls</LINE>

<LINE>A most miraculous work in this good king,</LINE>
<LINE>Which often, since my here-remain in England,</LINE>
<LINE>I have seen him do. How he solicits heaven,</LINE>
<LINE>Himself best knows; but strangely-visited people,</LINE>
<LINE>All swoll&#8217;n and ulcerous, pitiful to the eye,</LINE>
<LINE>The mere despair of surgery, he cures,</LINE>
<LINE>Hanging a golden stamp about their necks,</LINE>
<LINE>Put on with holy prayers, and &#8217;tis spoken,</LINE>
<LINE>To the succeeding royalty he leaves</LINE>
<LINE>The healing benediction. With this strange virtue,</LINE>

<LINE>Stands Scotland where it did?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSSE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">Alas, poor country,</LINE>
<LINE>Almost afraid to know itself! It cannot</LINE>
<LINE>Be call&#8217;d our mother, but our grave; where nothing,</LINE>
<LINE>But who knows nothing, is once seen to smile;</LINE>
<LINE>Where sighs, and groans, and shrieks that rent the air</LINE>
<LINE>Are made, not mark&#8217;d; where violent sorrow seems</LINE>
<LINE>A modern ecstasy. The dead man&#8217;s knell</LINE>
<LINE>Is there scarce ask&#8217;d for who, and good men&#8217;s lives</LINE>
<LINE>Expire before the flowers in their caps,</LINE>

<LINE>No, they were well at peace when I did leave &#8217;em.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>MACD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Be not a niggard of your speech; how goes&#8217;t?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSSE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>When I came hither to transport the tidings,</LINE>
<LINE>Which I have heavily borne, there ran a rumor</LINE>
<LINE>Of many worthy fellows that were out,</LINE>
<LINE>Which was to my belief witness&#8217;d the rather,</LINE>
<LINE>For that I saw the tyrant&#8217;s power afoot.</LINE>
<LINE>Now is the time of help; your eye in Scotland</LINE>
<LINE>Would create soldiers, make our women fight,</LINE>
<LINE>To doff their dire distresses.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">Be&#8217;t their comfort</LINE>
<LINE>We are coming thither. Gracious England hath</LINE>
<LINE>Lent us good Siward, and ten thousand men;</LINE>
<LINE>An older and a better soldier none</LINE>
<LINE>That Christendom gives out.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSSE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Would I could answer</LINE>
<LINE>This comfort with the like! But I have words</LINE>
<LINE>That would be howl&#8217;d out in the desert air,</LINE>
<LINE>Where hearing should not latch them.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="8">What concern they?</LINE>
<LINE>The general cause? Or is it a fee-grief</LINE>
<LINE>Due to some single breast?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSSE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">No mind that&#8217;s honest</LINE>

<LINE offset="5">Humh! I guess at it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSSE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your castle is surpris&#8217;d; your wife, and babes,</LINE>
<LINE>Savagely slaughter&#8217;d. To relate the manner,</LINE>
<LINE>Were on the quarry of these murder&#8217;d deer</LINE>
<LINE>To add the death of you.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Merciful heaven!</LINE>
<LINE>What, man, ne&#8217;er pull your hat upon your brows;</LINE>
<LINE>Give sorrow words. The grief that does not speak</LINE>
<LINE>Whispers the  o&#8217;er-fraught heart, and bids it break.</LINE>

<LINE>Dispute it like a man.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE offset="4">I shall do so;</LINE>
<LINE>But I must also feel it as a man:</LINE>
<LINE>I cannot but remember such things were,</LINE>
<LINE>That were most precious to me. Did heaven look on,</LINE>
<LINE>And would not take their part? Sinful Macduff,</LINE>
<LINE>They were all strook for thee! Naught that I am,</LINE>
<LINE>Not for their own demerits, but for mine,</LINE>
<LINE>Fell slaughter on their souls. Heaven rest them now!</LINE>

<LINE>Be this the whetstone of your sword, let grief</LINE>

<LINE>O, I could play the woman with mine eyes,</LINE>

<LINE>Cut short all intermission. Front to front</LINE>
<LINE>Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself;</LINE>
<LINE>Within my sword&#8217;s length set him; if he scape,</LINE>

<LINE>Come go we to the King, our power is ready,</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIW.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Some must go off; and yet, by these I see,</LINE>
<LINE>So great a day as this is cheaply bought.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Macduff is missing, and your noble son.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSSE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your son, my lord, has paid a soldier&#8217;s debt.</LINE>
<LINE>He only liv&#8217;d but till he was a man,</LINE>
<LINE>The which no sooner had his prowess confirm&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>In the unshrinking station where he fought,</LINE>
<LINE>But like a man he died.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIW.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Then he is dead?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSSE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, and brought off the field. Your cause of sorrow</LINE>
<LINE>Must not be measur&#8217;d by his worth, for then</LINE>
<LINE>It hath no end.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIW.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="3">Had he his hurts before?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSSE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, on the front.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIW.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="3">Why then. God&#8217;s soldier be he!</LINE>
<LINE>Had I as many sons as I have hairs,</LINE>
<LINE>I would not wish them to a fairer death.</LINE>
<LINE>And so his knell is knoll&#8217;d.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">He&#8217;s worth more sorrow,</LINE>
<LINE>And that I&#8217;ll spend for him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIW.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He&#8217;s worth no more;</LINE>
<LINE>They say he parted well, and paid his score,</LINE>
<LINE>And so God be with him! Here comes newer comfort.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Macduff with Macbeth&#8217;s head.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MACD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hail, King! For so thou art. Behold where stands</LINE>
<LINE>Th&#8217; usurper&#8217;s cursed head: the time is free.</LINE>
<LINE>I see thee compass&#8217;d with thy kingdom&#8217;s pearl,</LINE>
<LINE>That speak my salutation in their minds;</LINE>
<LINE>Whose voices I desire aloud with mine:</LINE>
<LINE>Hail, King of Scotland!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Hail, King of Scotland!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Flourish.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We shall not spend a large expense of time</LINE>
<LINE>Before we reckon with your several loves,</LINE>
<LINE>And make us even with you. My thanes and kinsmen,</LINE>
<LINE>Henceforth be earls, the first that ever Scotland</LINE>
<LINE>In such an honor nam&#8217;d. What&#8217;s more to do,</LINE>
<LINE>Which would be planted newly with the time,</LINE>
<LINE>As calling home our exil&#8217;d friends abroad</LINE>
<LINE>That fled the snares of watchful tyranny,</LINE>
<LINE>Producing forth the cruel ministers</LINE>
<LINE>Of this dead butcher and his fiend-like queen,</LINE>
<LINE>Who (as &#8217;tis thought) by self and violent hands</LINE>
<LINE>Took off her life; this, and what needful else</LINE>
<LINE>That calls upon us, by the grace of Grace,</LINE>
<LINE>We will perform in measure, time, and place.</LINE>
<LINE>So thanks to all at once and to each one,</LINE>
<LINE>Whom we invite to see us crown&#8217;d at Scone.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Flourish. Exeunt omnes.</STAGEDIR>
