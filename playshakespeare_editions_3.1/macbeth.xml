<line>Good sir, why do you start, and seem to fear</line>
<line>Things that do sound so fair?&#8212;I&#8217; th&#8217; name of truth,</line>
<line>Are ye fantastical, or that indeed</line>
<line>Which outwardly ye show? My noble partner</line>
<line>You greet with present grace, and great prediction</line>
<line>Of noble having and of royal hope,</line>
<line>That he seems rapt withal; to me you speak not.</line>
<line>If you can look into the seeds of time,</line>

<line>Stay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more:</line>
<line>By Sinel&#8217;s death I know I am Thane of Glamis,</line>
<line>But how of Cawdor? The Thane of Cawdor lives</line>
<line>A prosperous gentleman; and to be king</line>
<line>Stands not within the prospect of belief,</line>
<line>No more than to be Cawdor. Say from whence</line>
<line>You owe this strange intelligence, or why</line>
<line>Upon this blasted heath you stop our way</line>
<line>With such prophetic greeting? Speak, I charge you.</line>

<speaker>ROSSE.</speaker>
<line>The King hath happily receiv&#8217;d, Macbeth,</line>
<line>The news of thy success; and when he reads</line>
<line>Thy personal venture in the rebels&#8217; fight,</line>
<line>His wonders and his praises do contend</line>
<line>Which should be thine or his. Silenc&#8217;d with that,</line>
<line>In viewing  o&#8217;er the rest  o&#8217; th&#8217; self-same day,</line>
<line>He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks,</line>
<line>Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make,</line>
<line>Strange images of death. As thick as tale</line>
<line>Came post with post, and every one did bear</line>
<line>Thy praises in his kingdom&#8217;s great defense,</line>

<line>With hidden help and vantage, or that with both</line>
<line>He labor&#8217;d in his country&#8217;s wrack, I know not;</line>

<line offset="5">That, trusted home,</line>

<line>If good, why do I yield to that suggestion</line>
<line>Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair</line>
<line>And make my seated heart knock at my ribs,</line>
<line>Against the use of nature? Present fears</line>
<line>Are less than horrible imaginings:</line>
<line>My thought, whose murder yet is but fantastical,</line>
<line>Shakes so my single state of man that function</line>

<line><recite>&#8220;They met me in the day of success; and I have learn&#8217;d by the perfect&#8217;st report, they have more in them than mortal knowledge. When I burnt in desire to question them further, they made themselves air, into which they vanish&#8217;d. Whiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it, came missives from the King, who all-hail&#8217;d me &#8220;Thane of Cawdor,&#8221; by which title, before, these we&#239;rd sisters saluted me, and referr&#8217;d me to the coming on of time with &#8220;Hail, King that shalt be!&#8221; This have I thought good to deliver thee, my dearest partner of greatness, that thou mightst not lose the dues of rejoicing by being ignorant of what greatness is promis&#8217;d thee. Lay it to thy heart, and farewell.&#8221;</recite></line>
<line>Glamis thou art, and Cawdor, and shalt be</line>
<line>What thou art promis&#8217;d. Yet do I fear thy nature,</line>
<line>It is too full  o&#8217; th&#8217; milk of human kindness</line>
<line>To catch the nearest way. Thou wouldst be great,</line>
<line>Art not without ambition, but without</line>
<line>The illness should attend it. What thou wouldst highly,</line>
<line>That wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false,</line>
<line>And yet wouldst wrongly win. Thou&#8217;ldst have, great Glamis,</line>
<line>That which cries, &#8220;Thus thou must do,&#8221; if thou have it;</line>
<line>And that which rather thou dost fear to do</line>
<line>Than wishest should be undone. Hie thee hither,</line>
<line>That I may pour my spirits in thine ear,</line>
<line>And chastise with the valor of my tongue</line>
<line>All that impedes thee from the golden round,</line>

<line>There&#8217;s one did laugh in &#8217;s sleep, and one cried, &#8220;Murder!&#8221;</line>

<speech>
<speaker>LADY M.</speaker>
<line>Who was it that thus cried? Why, worthy thane,</line>
<line>You do unbend your noble strength, to think</line>
<line>So brain-sickly of things. Go get some water,</line>
<line>And wash this filthy witness from your hand.</line>
<line>Why did you bring these daggers from the place?</line>
<line>They must lie there. Go carry them, and smear</line>
<line>The sleepy grooms with blood.</line>

<line>Give me the daggers. The sleeping and the dead</line>

<line>Faith, sir, we were carousing till the second cock; and drink, sir, is a great provoker of three things.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MACD.</speaker>
<line>What three things does drink especially provoke?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PORT.</speaker>
<line>Marry, sir, nose-painting, sleep, and urine. Lechery, sir, it provokes, and unprovokes: it provokes the desire, but it takes away the performance. Therefore much drink may be said to be an equivocator with lechery: it makes him, and it mars him; it sets him on, and it takes him off; it persuades him, and disheartens him; makes him stand to, and not stand to; in conclusion, equivocates him in a sleep, and giving him the lie, leaves him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MACD.</speaker>
<line>I believe drink gave thee the lie last night.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PORT.</speaker>
<line>That it did, sir, i&#8217; the very throat on me; but I requited him for his lie, and (I think) being too strong for him, though he took up my legs sometime, yet I made a shift to cast him.</line>

<line>Thou play&#8217;dst most foully for&#8217;t; yet it was said</line>
<line>It should not stand in thy posterity,</line>
<line>But that myself should be the root and father</line>
<line>Of many kings. If there come truth from them&#8212;</line>
<line>As upon thee, Macbeth, their speeches shine&#8212;</line>
<line>Why, by the verities on thee made good,</line>
<line>May they not be my oracles as well,</line>
<line>And set me up in hope? But hush, no more.</line>

<speaker>MACB.</speaker>
<line>Tonight we hold a solemn supper, sir,</line>
<line>And I&#8217;ll request your presence.</line>

<line offset="5">Ay, my good lord.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>MACB.</speaker>
<line>We should have else desir&#8217;d your good advice</line>
<line>(Which still hath been both grave and prosperous)</line>
<line>In this day&#8217;s council; but we&#8217;ll take tomorrow.</line>
<line>Is&#8217;t far you ride?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BAN.</speaker>
<line>As far, my lord, as will fill up the time</line>
<line>&#8217;Twixt this and supper. Go not my horse the better,</line>
<line>I must become a borrower of the night</line>
<line>For a dark hour or twain.</line>

<speaker>MACB.</speaker>
<line>We hear our bloody cousins are bestow&#8217;d</line>
<line>In England and in Ireland, not confessing</line>
<line>Their cruel parricide, filling their hearers</line>
<line>With strange invention. But of that tomorrow,</line>
<line>When therewithal we shall have cause of state</line>

<line>Farewell.</line>
<stagedir>Exit Banquo.</stagedir>

<stagedir>Exeunt Lords with Lady Macbeth and others. Manent Macbeth and a Servant.</stagedir>
<line>Sirrah, a word with you. Attend those men</line>

<line>They are, my lord, without the palace gate.</line>

<speaker>MACB.</speaker>

<stagedir>Exit Servant.</stagedir>
<line offset="4">To be thus is nothing,</line>
<line>But to be safely thus. Our fears in Banquo</line>
<line>Stick deep, and in his royalty of nature</line>
<line>Reigns that which would be fear&#8217;d. &#8217;Tis much he dares,</line>
<line>And to that dauntless temper of his mind,</line>
<line>He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valor</line>
<line>To act in safety. There is none but he</line>
<line>Whose being I do fear; and under him</line>
<line>My Genius is rebuk&#8217;d, as it is said</line>
<line>Mark Antony&#8217;s was by Caesar. He chid the sisters</line>
<line>When first they put the name of king upon me,</line>
<line>And bade them speak to him; then prophet-like</line>
<line>They hail&#8217;d him father to a line of kings.</line>
<line>Upon my head they plac&#8217;d a fruitless crown,</line>
<line>And put a barren sceptre in my gripe,</line>
<line>Thence to be wrench&#8217;d with an unlineal hand,</line>
<line>No son of mine succeeding. If&#8217;t be so,</line>
<line>For Banquo&#8217;s issue have I fil&#8217;d my mind,</line>
<line>For them the gracious Duncan have I murder&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Put rancors in the vessel of my peace</line>
<line>Only for them, and mine eternal jewel</line>
<line>Given to the common enemy of man,</line>
<line>To make them kings&#8212;the seeds of Banquo kings!</line>
<line>Rather than so, come fate into the list,</line>
<line>And champion me to th&#8217; utterance! Who&#8217;s there?</line>

<stagedir>Enter Servant and two Murderers.</stagedir>
<line>Now go to the door, and stay there till we call.</line>
<stagedir>Exit Servant.</stagedir>
<line>Was it not yesterday we spoke together?</line>

<speech>
<speaker>BOTH 1. MUR. AND 2. MUR.</speaker>
<line>It was, so please your Highness.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MACB.</speaker>
<line offset="7">Well then, now</line>
<line>Have you consider&#8217;d of my speeches?&#8212;know</line>
<line>That it was he in the times past which held you</line>
<line>So under fortune, which you thought had been</line>
<line>Our innocent self? This I made good to you</line>
<line>In our last conference, pass&#8217;d in probation with you:</line>
<line>How you were borne in hand, how cross&#8217;d, the instruments,</line>
<line>Who wrought with them, and all things else that might</line>
<line>To half a soul and to a notion craz&#8217;d</line>
<line>Say, &#8220;Thus did Banquo.&#8221;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. MUR.</speaker>
<line offset="5">You made it known to us.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MACB.</speaker>
<line>I did so; and went further, which is now</line>
<line>Our point of second meeting. Do you find</line>
<line>Your patience so predominant in your nature</line>
<line>That you can let this go? Are you so gospell&#8217;d,</line>
<line>To pray for this good man, and for his issue,</line>
<line>Whose heavy hand hath bow&#8217;d you to the grave,</line>
<line>And beggar&#8217;d yours forever?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. MUR.</speaker>
<line offset="6">We are men, my liege.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MACB.</speaker>
<line>Ay, in the catalogue ye go for men,</line>
<line>As hounds and greyhounds, mungrels, spaniels, curs,</line>
<line>Shoughs, water-rugs, and demi-wolves are clipt</line>
<line>All by the name of dogs; the valued file</line>
<line>Distinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle,</line>
<line>The house-keeper, the hunter, every one,</line>
<line>According to the gift which bounteous nature</line>
<line>Hath in him clos&#8217;d; whereby he does receive</line>
<line>Particular addition, from the bill</line>
<line>That writes them all alike: and so of men.</line>
<line>Now, if you have a station in the file,</line>
<line>Not i&#8217; th&#8217; worst rank of manhood, say&#8217;t,</line>
<line>And I will put that business in your bosoms,</line>
<line>Whose execution takes your enemy off,</line>
<line>Grapples you to the heart and love of us,</line>
<line>Who wear our health but sickly in his life,</line>
<line>Which in his death were perfect.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. MUR.</speaker>
<line offset="7">I am one, my liege,</line>
<line>Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world</line>
<line>Hath so incens&#8217;d that I am reckless what</line>
<line>I do to spite the world.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. MUR.</speaker>
<line offset="5">And I another,</line>
<line>So weary with disasters, tugg&#8217;d with fortune,</line>
<line>That I would set my life on any chance,</line>
<line>To mend it, or be rid on&#8217;t.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MACB.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Both of you</line>
<line>Know Banquo was your enemy.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BOTH 1. MUR. AND 2. MUR.</speaker>
<line offset="7">True, my lord.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MACB.</speaker>
<line>So is he mine; and in such bloody distance,</line>
<line>That every minute of his being thrusts</line>
<line>Against my near&#8217;st of life; and though I could</line>
<line>With barefac&#8217;d power sweep him from my sight,</line>
<line>And bid my will avouch it, yet I must not,</line>
<line>For certain friends that are both his and mine,</line>
<line>Whose loves I may not drop, but wail his fall</line>
<line>Who I myself struck down. And thence it is</line>
<line>That I to your assistance do make love,</line>
<line>Masking the business from the common eye</line>
<line>For sundry weighty reasons.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. MUR.</speaker>
<line offset="6">We shall, my lord,</line>
<line>Perform what you command us.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. MUR.</speaker>
<line offset="7">Though our lives&#8212;</line>

<speaker>MACB.</speaker>
<line>Your spirits shine through you. Within this hour, at most,</line>
<line>I will advise you where to plant yourselves,</line>
<line>Acquaint you with the perfect spy  o&#8217; th&#8217; time,</line>
<line>The moment on&#8217;t, for&#8217;t must be done tonight,</line>
<line>And something from the palace; always thought</line>
<line>That I require a clearness: and with him&#8212;</line>
<line>To leave no rubs nor botches in the work&#8212;</line>
<line>Fleance his son, that keeps him company,</line>
<line>Whose absence is no less material to me</line>
<line>Than is his father&#8217;s, must embrace the fate</line>
<line>Of that dark hour. Resolve yourselves apart,</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll come to you anon.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BOTH 1. MUR. AND 2. MUR.</speaker>
<line offset="4">We are resolv&#8217;d, my lord.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MACB.</speaker>
<line>I&#8217;ll call upon you straight; abide within.</line>
<stagedir>Exeunt Murderers.</stagedir>

<stagedir>Enter Macbeth.</stagedir>
<line>How now, my lord, why do you keep alone,</line>
<line>Of sorriest fancies your companions making,</line>
<line>Using those thoughts which should indeed have died</line>

<line>But let the frame of things disjoint, both the worlds suffer,</line>
<line>Ere we will eat our meal in fear, and sleep</line>
<line>In the affliction of these terrible dreams</line>
<line>That shake us nightly. Better be with the dead,</line>
<line>Whom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace,</line>

<line>So shall I, love, and so, I pray, be you.</line>
<line>Let your remembrance apply to Banquo,</line>

<line>Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day,</line>
<line>And with thy bloody and invisible hand</line>
<line>Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond</line>
<line>Which keeps me pale! Light thickens, and the crow</line>
<line>Makes wing to th&#8217; rooky wood;</line>
<line>Good things of day begin to droop and drowse,</line>
<line>Whiles night&#8217;s black agents to their preys do rouse.</line>

<line>Sit, worthy friends; my lord is often thus,</line>
<line>And hath been from his youth. Pray you keep seat.</line>
<line>The fit is momentary, upon a thought</line>
<line>He will again be well. If much you note him,</line>
<line>You shall offend him and extend his passion.</line>
<line>Feed, and regard him not.&#8212;Are you a man?</line>

<speaker>MACB.</speaker>
<line>Ay, and a bold one, that dare look on that</line>

<speaker>LADY M.</speaker>
<line offset="6">O proper stuff!</line>
<line>This is the very painting of your fear;</line>
<line>This is the air-drawn dagger which you said</line>
<line>Led you to Duncan. O, these flaws and starts</line>
<line>(Impostors to true fear) would well become</line>
<line>A woman&#8217;s story at a winter&#8217;s fire,</line>
<line>Authoriz&#8217;d by her grandam. Shame itself,</line>
<line>Why do you make such faces? When all&#8217;s done,</line>

<line>Too terrible for the ear. The time has been,</line>
<line>That when the brains were out, the man would die,</line>
<line>And there an end; but now they rise again</line>
<line>With twenty mortal murders on their crowns,</line>

<speech>
<speaker>LEN.</speaker>
<line>My former speeches have but hit your thoughts,</line>
<line>Which can interpret farther; only I say</line>
<line>Things have been strangely borne. The gracious Duncan</line>
<line>Was pitied of Macbeth; marry, he was dead.</line>
<line>And the right valiant Banquo walk&#8217;d too late,</line>
<line>Whom you may say (if&#8217;t please you) Fleance kill&#8217;d,</line>
<line>For Fleance fled. Men must not walk too late.</line>
<line>Who cannot want the thought, how monstrous</line>
<line>It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain</line>
<line>To kill their gracious father? Damned fact!</line>
<line>How it did grieve Macbeth! Did he not straight</line>
<line>In pious rage the two delinquents tear,</line>
<line>That were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep?</line>
<line>Was not that nobly done? Ay, and wisely too;</line>
<line>For &#8217;twould have anger&#8217;d any heart alive</line>
<line>To hear the men deny&#8217;t. So that, I say,</line>
<line>He has borne all things well, and I do think</line>
<line>That had he Duncan&#8217;s sons under his key</line>
<line>(As, and&#8217;t please heaven, he shall not), they should find</line>
<line>What &#8217;twere to kill a father; so should Fleance.</line>
<line>But peace! For from broad words, and &#8217;cause he fail&#8217;d</line>
<line>His presence at the tyrant&#8217;s feast, I hear</line>
<line>Macduff lives in disgrace. Sir, can you tell</line>

<line>That the malevolence of fortune nothing</line>

<line>Is gone to pray the holy king, upon his aid</line>
<line>To wake Northumberland and warlike Siward,</line>
<line>That by the help of these (with Him above</line>

<line>Give to our tables meat, sleep to our nights;</line>
<line>Free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives;</line>

<line>Thy crown does sear mine eyeballs. And thy hair,</line>

<line>What, will the line stretch out to th&#8217; crack of doom?</line>
<line>Another yet? A seventh? I&#8217;ll see no more.</line>
<line>And yet the eight appears, who bears a glass</line>
<line>Which shows me many more; and some I see</line>
<line>That twofold balls and treble sceptres carry.</line>
<line>Horrible sight! Now I see &#8217;tis true,</line>

<line>You must have patience, madam.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>L. MACD.</speaker>
<line offset="7">He had none;</line>

<line>Wisdom? To leave his wife, to leave his babes,</line>
<line>His mansion and his titles, in a place</line>
<line>From whence himself does fly? He loves us not,</line>
<line>He wants the natural touch; for the poor wren,</line>
<line>The most diminutive of birds, will fight,</line>
<line>Her young ones in her nest, against the owl.</line>
<line>All is the fear, and nothing is the love;</line>

<line offset="5">My dearest coz,</line>
<line>I pray you school yourself. But for your husband,</line>
<line>He is noble, wise, judicious, and best knows</line>
<line>The fits  o&#8217; th&#8217; season. I dare not speak much further,</line>
<line>But cruel are the times when we are traitors,</line>
<line>And do not know ourselves; when we hold rumor</line>
<line>From what we fear, yet know not what we fear,</line>
<line>But float upon a wild and violent sea</line>
<line>Each way, and move. I take my leave of you;</line>
<line>&#8217;Shall not be long but I&#8217;ll be here again.</line>

<line offset="6">Alas, poor country,</line>
<line>Almost afraid to know itself! It cannot</line>
<line>Be call&#8217;d our mother, but our grave; where nothing,</line>
<line>But who knows nothing, is once seen to smile;</line>
<line>Where sighs, and groans, and shrieks that rent the air</line>
<line>Are made, not mark&#8217;d; where violent sorrow seems</line>
<line>A modern ecstasy. The dead man&#8217;s knell</line>
<line>Is there scarce ask&#8217;d for who, and good men&#8217;s lives</line>

<line>Which was to my belief witness&#8217;d the rather,</line>
<line>For that I saw the tyrant&#8217;s power afoot.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>ROSSE.</speaker>
<line>Your castle is surpris&#8217;d; your wife, and babes,</line>

<line offset="4">I shall do so;</line>
<line>But I must also feel it as a man:</line>
<line>I cannot but remember such things were,</line>
<line>That were most precious to me. Did heaven look on,</line>
<line>And would not take their part? Sinful Macduff,</line>
<line>They were all strook for thee! Naught that I am,</line>
<line>Not for their own demerits, but for mine,</line>

<line>Be this the whetstone of your sword, let grief</line>
<line>Convert to anger; blunt not the heart, enrage it.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>MACD.</speaker>
<line>O, I could play the woman with mine eyes,</line>
<line>And braggart with my tongue! But, gentle heavens,</line>
<line>Cut short all intermission. Front to front</line>
<line>Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself;</line>
<line>Within my sword&#8217;s length set him; if he scape,</line>

<line>Since his Majesty went into the field, I have seen her rise from her bed, throw her night-gown upon her, unlock her closet, take forth paper, fold it, write upon&#8217;t, read it, afterwards seal it, and again return to bed; yet all this while in a most fast sleep.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DOCT. PHYS.</speaker>

<line>Out, damn&#8217;d spot! Out, I say! One&#8212;two&#8212;why then &#8217;tis time to do&#8217;t. Hell is murky. Fie, my lord, fie, a soldier, and afeard?

<line>Hang out our banners on the outward walls,</line>
<line>The cry is still, &#8220;They come!&#8221; Our castle&#8217;s strength</line>
<line>Will laugh a siege to scorn; here let them lie</line>
<line>Till famine and the ague eat them up.</line>
<line>Were they not forc&#8217;d with those that should be ours,</line>

<stagedir>A cry within of women.</stagedir>

<line>It is the cry of women, my good lord.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>MACB.</speaker>
<line>I have almost forgot the taste of fears.</line>
<line>The time has been, my senses would have cool&#8217;d</line>
<line>To hear a night-shriek, and my fell of hair</line>
<line>Would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir</line>
<line>As life were in&#8217;t. I have supp&#8217;d full with horrors;</line>
<line>Direness, familiar to my slaughterous thoughts,</line>
<line>Cannot once start me.</line>

<stagedir>Enter Seyton.</stagedir>

<line>The Queen, my lord, is dead.</line>

<speaker>MACB.</speaker>
<line>She should have died hereafter;</line>
<line>There would have been a time for such a word.</line>
<line>Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow,</line>
<line>Creeps in this petty pace from day to day,</line>
<line>To the last syllable of recorded time;</line>
<line>And all our yesterdays have lighted fools</line>
<line>The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!</line>
<line>Life&#8217;s but a walking shadow, a poor player,</line>
<line>That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,</line>
<line>And then is heard no more. It is a tale</line>
<line>Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,</line>
<line>Signifying nothing.</line>

<stagedir>Enter a Messenger.</stagedir>

<line>I care not if thou dost for me as much.</line>
<line>I pull in resolution, and begin</line>
<line>To doubt th&#8217; equivocation of the fiend</line>
<line>That lies like truth. &#8220;Fear not, till Birnan wood</line>
<line>Do come to Dunsinane,&#8221; and now a wood</line>
<line>Comes toward Dunsinane. Arm, arm, and out!</line>
<line>If this which he avouches does appear,</line>
<line>There is nor flying hence, nor tarrying here.</line>
<line>I gin to be a-weary of the sun,</line>
