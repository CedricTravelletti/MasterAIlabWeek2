<STAGEDIR>Enter Leonato, governor of Messina, Hero his daughter, and Beatrice his niece, with a Messenger.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I learn in this letter that Don Pedro of Arragon comes this night to Messina.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MESS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He is very near by this, he was not three leagues off when I left him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How many gentlemen have you lost in this action?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MESS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But few of any sort, and none of name.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A victory is twice itself when the achiever brings home full numbers. I find here that Don Pedro hath bestow&#8217;d much honor on a young Florentine call&#8217;d Claudio.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MESS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Much deserv&#8217;d on his part, and equally rememb&#8217;red by Don Pedro. He hath borne himself beyond the promise of his age, doing in the figure of a lamb the feats of a lion. He hath indeed better bett&#8217;red expectation than you must expect of me to tell you how.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He hath an uncle here in Messina will be very much glad of it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MESS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have already deliver&#8217;d him letters, and there appears much joy in him, even so much that joy could not show itself modest enough without a badge of bitterness.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Did he break out into tears?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MESS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In great measure.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A kind overflow of kindness. There are no faces truer than those that are so wash&#8217;d. How much better is it to weep at joy than to joy at weeping!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEAT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I pray you, is Signior Mountanto return&#8217;d from the wars or no?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MESS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know none of that name, lady. There was none such in the army of any sort.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What is he that you ask for, niece?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HERO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MESS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, he&#8217;s return&#8217;d, and as pleasant as ever he was.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEAT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He set up his bills here in Messina, and challeng&#8217;d Cupid at the flight, and my uncle&#8217;s fool, reading the challenge, subscrib&#8217;d for Cupid, and challeng&#8217;d him at the burbolt. I pray you, how many hath he kill&#8217;d and eaten in these wars? But how many hath he kill&#8217;d? For indeed I promis&#8217;d to eat all of his killing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Faith, niece, you tax Signior Benedick too much, but he&#8217;ll be meet with you, I doubt it not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MESS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He hath done good service, lady, in these wars.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEAT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You had musty victual, and he hath holp to eat it. He is a very valiant trencherman, he hath an excellent stomach.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MESS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And a good soldier too, lady.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEAT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And a good soldier to a lady, but what is he to a lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MESS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A lord to a lord, a man to a man, stuff&#8217;d with all honorable virtues.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEAT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is so indeed, he is no less than a stuff&#8217;d man. But for the stuffing&#8212;well, we are all mortal.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You must not, sir, mistake my niece. There is a kind of merry war betwixt Signior Benedick and her; they never meet but there&#8217;s a skirmish of wit between them.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEAT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alas, he gets nothing by that. In our last conflict four of his five wits went halting off, and now is the whole man govern&#8217;d with one; so that if he have wit enough to keep himself warm, let him bear it for a difference between himself and his horse, for it is all the wealth that he hath left to be known a reasonable creature. Who is his companion now? He hath every month a new sworn brother.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MESS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is&#8217;t possible?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEAT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Very easily possible. He wears his faith but as the fashion of his hat: it ever changes with the next block.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MESS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I see, lady, the gentleman is not in your books.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEAT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, and he were, I would burn my study. But I pray you, who is his companion? Is there no young squarer now that will make a voyage with him to the devil?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MESS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He is most in the company of the right noble Claudio.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEAT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O Lord, he will hang upon him like a disease; he is sooner caught than the pestilence, and the taker runs presently mad. God help the noble Claudio! If he have caught the Benedick, it will cost him a thousand pound ere &#8217;a be cur&#8217;d.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MESS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will hold friends with you, lady.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEAT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do, good friend.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You will never run mad, niece.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEAT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, not till a hot January.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MESS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Don Pedro is approach&#8217;d.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Don Pedro, Claudio, Benedick, Balthasar, and Don John the Bastard.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>D. PEDRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good Signior Leonato, are you come to meet your trouble? The fashion of the world is to avoid cost, and you encounter it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Never came trouble to my house in the likeness of your Grace, for trouble being gone, comfort should remain; but when you depart from me, sorrow abides and happiness takes his leave.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>D. PEDRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You embrace your charge too willingly. I think this is your daughter.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Her mother hath many times told me so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Were you in doubt, sir, that you ask&#8217;d her?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Signior Benedick, no, for then were you a child.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>D. PEDRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You have it full, Benedick. We may guess by this what you are, being a man. Truly the lady fathers herself. Be happy, lady, for you are like an honorable father.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If Signior Leonato be her father, she would not have his head on her shoulders for all Messina, as like him as she is.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEAT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I wonder that you will still be talking, Signior Benedick, nobody marks you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, my dear Lady Disdain! Are you yet living?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEAT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is it possible disdain should die while she hath such meet food to feed it as Signior Benedick? Courtesy itself must convert to disdain, if you come in her presence.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then is courtesy a turncoat. But it is certain I am lov&#8217;d of all ladies, only you excepted; and I would I could find in my heart that I had not a hard heart, for truly I love none.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEAT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A dear happiness to women, they would else have been troubled with a pernicious suitor. I thank God and my cold blood, I am of your humor for that: I had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man swear he loves me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>God keep your ladyship still in that mind! So some gentleman or other shall scape a predestinate scratch&#8217;d face.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEAT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Scratching could not make it worse, and &#8217;twere such a face as yours were.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, you are a rare parrot-teacher.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEAT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would my horse had the speed of your tongue, and so good a continuer. But keep your way a&#8217; God&#8217;s name, I have done.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEAT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You always end with a jade&#8217;s trick, I know you of old.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>D. PEDRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That is the sum of all: Leonato&#8212;Signior Claudio and Signior Benedick&#8212;my dear friend Leonato hath invited you all. I tell him we shall stay here at the least a month, and he heartily prays some occasion may detain us longer. I dare swear he is no hypocrite, but prays from his heart.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If you swear, my lord, you shall not be forsworn.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>To Don John.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Let me bid you welcome, my lord, being reconcil&#8217;d to the Prince your brother: I owe you all duty.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>D. JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I thank you. I am not of many words, but I thank you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Please it your Grace lead on?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>D. PEDRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your hand, Leonato, we will go together.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt. Manent Benedick and Claudio.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Benedick, didst thou note the daughter of Signior Leonato?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I noted her not, but I look&#8217;d on her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is she not a modest young lady?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do you question me, as an honest man should do, for my simple true judgment? Or would you have me speak after my custom, as being a profess&#8217;d tyrant to their sex?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, I pray thee speak in sober judgment.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, i&#8217; faith, methinks she&#8217;s too low for a high praise, too brown for a fair praise, and too little for a great praise; only this commendation I can afford her, that were she other than she is, she were unhandsome, and being no other but as she is, I do not like her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou thinkest I am in sport. I pray thee tell me truly how thou lik&#8217;st her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Would you buy her, that you inquire after her?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Can the world buy such a jewel?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yea, and a case to put it into. But speak you this with a sad brow? Or do you play the flouting Jack, to tell us Cupid is a good hare-finder and Vulcan a rare carpenter? Come, in what key shall a man take you to go in the song?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In mine eye, she is the sweetest lady that ever I look&#8217;d on.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I can see yet without spectacles, and I see no such matter. There&#8217;s her cousin, and she were not possess&#8217;d with a fury, exceeds her as much in beauty as the first of May doth the last of December. But I hope you have no intent to turn husband, have you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would scarce trust myself, though I had sworn the contrary, if Hero would be my wife.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is&#8217;t come to this? In faith, hath not the world one man but he will wear his cap with suspicion? Shall I never see a bachelor of threescore again? Go to, i&#8217; faith, and thou wilt needs thrust thy neck into a yoke, wear the print of it, and sigh away Sundays. Look, Don Pedro is return&#8217;d to seek you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Don Pedro.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>D. PEDRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What secret hath held you here, that you follow&#8217;d not to Leonato&#8217;s?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would your Grace would constrain me to tell.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>D. PEDRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I charge thee on thy allegiance.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You hear, Count Claudio, I can be secret as a dumb man; I would have you think so; but on my allegiance, mark you this, on my allegiance, he is in love. With who? Now that is your Grace&#8217;s part. Mark how short his answer is: with Hero, Leonato&#8217;s short daughter.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If this were so, so were it utt&#8217;red.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Like the old tale, my lord: &#8220;It is not so, nor &#8217;twas not so, but indeed, God forbid it should be so.&#8221;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If my passion change not shortly, God forbid it should be otherwise.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>D. PEDRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Amen, if you love her, for the lady is very well worthy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You speak this to fetch me in, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>D. PEDRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By my troth, I speak my thought.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And in faith, my lord, I spoke mine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And by my two faiths and troths, my lord, I spoke mine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That I love her, I feel.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>D. PEDRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That she is worthy, I know.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That I neither feel how she should be lov&#8217;d, nor know how she should be worthy, is the opinion that fire cannot melt out of me; I will die in it at the stake.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>D. PEDRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou wast ever an obstinate heretic in the despite of beauty.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And never could maintain his part but in the force of his will.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That a woman conceiv&#8217;d me, I thank her; that she brought me up, I likewise give her most humble thanks; but that I will have a rechate winded in my forehead, or hang my bugle in an invisible baldrick, all women shall pardon me. Because I will not do them the wrong to mistrust any, I will do myself the right to trust none; and the fine is (for the which I may go the finer), I will live a bachelor.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>D. PEDRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I shall see thee, ere I die, look pale with love.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>With anger, with sickness, or with hunger, my lord, not with love. Prove that ever I lose more blood with love than I will get again with drinking, pick out mine eyes with a ballad-maker&#8217;s pen, and hang me up at the door of a brothel-house for the sign of blind Cupid.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>D. PEDRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, if ever thou dost fall from this faith, thou wilt prove a notable argument.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If I do, hang me in a bottle like a cat, and shoot at me, and he that hits me, let him be clapp&#8217;d on the shoulder, and call&#8217;d Adam.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>D. PEDRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, as time shall try:</LINE>
<LINE>&#8220;In time the savage bull doth bear the yoke.&#8221;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The savage bull may, but if ever the sensible Benedick bear it, pluck off the bull&#8217;s horns, and set them in my forehead, and let me be vildly painted, and in such great letters as they write &#8220;Here is good horse to hire,&#8221; let them signify under my sign, &#8220;Here you may see Benedick the married man.&#8221;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If this should ever happen, thou wouldst be horn-mad.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>D. PEDRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, if Cupid have not spent all his quiver in Venice, thou wilt quake for this shortly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I look for an earthquake too then.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>D. PEDRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, you will temporize with the hours. In the mean time, good Signior Benedick, repair to Leonato&#8217;s, commend me to him, and tell him I will not fail him at supper, for indeed he hath made great preparation.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have almost matter enough in me for such an embassage, and so I commit you&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To the tuition of God. From my house&#8212;if I had it&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>D. PEDRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The sixt of July. Your loving friend, Benedick.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, mock not, mock not. The body of your discourse is sometime guarded with fragments, and the guards are but slightly basted on neither. Ere you flout old ends any further, examine your conscience, and so I leave you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My liege, your Highness now may do me good.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>D. PEDRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My love is thine to teach; teach it but how,</LINE>
<LINE>And thou shalt see how apt it is to learn</LINE>
<LINE>Any hard lesson that may do thee good.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hath Leonato any son, my lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>D. PEDRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No child but Hero, she&#8217;s his only heir.</LINE>
<LINE>Dost thou affect her, Claudio?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O my lord,</LINE>
<LINE>When you went onward on this ended action,</LINE>
<LINE>I look&#8217;d upon her with a soldier&#8217;s eye,</LINE>
<LINE>That lik&#8217;d, but had a rougher task in hand</LINE>
<LINE>Than to drive liking to the name of love.</LINE>
<LINE>But now I am return&#8217;d, and that war-thoughts</LINE>
<LINE>Have left their places vacant, in their rooms</LINE>
<LINE>Come thronging soft and delicate desires,</LINE>
<LINE>All prompting me how fair young Hero is,</LINE>
<LINE>Saying I lik&#8217;d her ere I went to wars.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>D. PEDRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou wilt be like a lover presently,</LINE>
<LINE>And tire the hearer with a book of words.</LINE>
<LINE>If thou dost love fair Hero, cherish it,</LINE>
<LINE>And I will break with her, and with her father,</LINE>
<LINE>And thou shalt have her. Was&#8217;t not to this end</LINE>
<LINE>That thou began&#8217;st to twist so fine a story?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How sweetly you do minister to love,</LINE>
<LINE>That know love&#8217;s grief by his complexion!</LINE>
<LINE>But lest my liking might too sudden seem,</LINE>
<LINE>I would have salv&#8217;d it with a longer treatise.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>D. PEDRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What need the bridge much broader than the flood?</LINE>
<LINE>The fairest grant is the necessity.</LINE>
<LINE>Look what will serve is fit: &#8217;tis once, thou lovest,</LINE>
<LINE>And I will fit thee with the remedy.</LINE>
<LINE>I know we shall have revelling tonight;</LINE>
<LINE>I will assume thy part in some disguise,</LINE>
<LINE>And tell fair Hero I am Claudio,</LINE>
<LINE>And in her bosom I&#8217;ll unclasp my heart,</LINE>
<LINE>And take her hearing prisoner with the force</LINE>
<LINE>And strong encounter of my amorous tale;</LINE>
<LINE>Then after to her father will I break,</LINE>
<LINE>And the conclusion is, she shall be thine.</LINE>

<SCENELOCATION>A room in Leonato&#8217;s house.</SCENELOCATION>
<SCENEPERSONAE>(Leonato, Antonio)</SCENEPERSONAE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Leonato and an old man Antonio, brother to Leonato, meeting.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How now, brother, where is my cousin, your son? Hath he provided this music?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He is very busy about it. But, brother, I can tell you strange news that you yet dreamt not of.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Are they good?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As the event stamps them, but they have a good cover; they show well outward. The Prince and Count Claudio, walking in a thick-pleach&#8217;d alley in mine orchard, were thus much overheard by a man of mine. The Prince discover&#8217;d to Claudio that he lov&#8217;d my niece your daughter, and meant to acknowledge it this night in a dance; and if he found her accordant, he meant to take the present time by the top, and instantly break with you of it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hath the fellow any wit that told you this?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A good sharp fellow. I will send for him, and question him yourself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, no, we will hold it as a dream till it appear itself; but I will acquaint my daughter withal, that she may be the better prepar&#8217;d for an answer, if peradventure this be true. Go you and tell her of it.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Several persons cross the stage.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Cousins, you know what you have to do. O, I cry you mercy, friend, go you with me, and I will use your skill. Good cousin, have a care this busy time.</LINE>

<SCENEPERSONAE>(Don John the Bastard, Conrade, Borachio)</SCENEPERSONAE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Don John the Bastard and Conrade, his companion.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What the good-year, my lord, why are you thus out of measure sad?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>D. JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There is no measure in the occasion that breeds, therefore the sadness is without limit.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You should hear reason.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>D. JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And when I have heard it, what blessing brings it?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If not a present remedy, at least a patient sufferance.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>D. JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I wonder that thou (being, as thou say&#8217;st thou art, born under Saturn) goest about to apply a moral medicine to a mortifying mischief. I cannot hide what I am: I must be sad when I have cause, and smile at no man&#8217;s jests; eat when I have stomach, and wait for no man&#8217;s leisure; sleep when I am drowsy, and tend on no man&#8217;s business; laugh when I am merry, and claw no man in his humor.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yea, but you must not make the full show of this till you may do it without controlment. You have of late stood out against your brother, and he hath ta&#8217;en you newly into his grace, where it is impossible you should take true root but by the fair weather that you make yourself. It is needful that you frame the season for your own harvest.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>D. JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in his grace, and it better fits my blood to be disdain&#8217;d of all than to fashion a carriage to rob love from any. In this (though I cannot be said to be a flattering honest man) it must not be denied but I am a plain-dealing villain. I am trusted with a muzzle, and enfranchis&#8217;d with a clog, therefore I have decreed not to sing in my cage. If I had my mouth, I would bite; if I had my liberty, I would do my liking. In the mean time let me be that I am, and seek not to alter me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Can you make no use of your discontent?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>D. JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I make all use of it, for I use it only. Who comes here?</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter Borachio.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>What news, Borachio?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BORA.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I came yonder from a great supper. The Prince your brother is royally entertain&#8217;d by Leonato, and I can give you intelligence of an intended marriage.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>D. JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Will it serve for any model to build mischief on? What is he for a fool that betroths himself to unquietness?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BORA.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, it is your brother&#8217;s right hand.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>D. JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who, the most exquisite Claudio?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BORA.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Even he.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>D. JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A proper squire! And who, and who? Which way looks he?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BORA.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, one Hero, the daughter and heir of Leonato.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>D. JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A very forward March-chick! How came you to this?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BORA.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Being entertain&#8217;d for a perfumer, as I was smoking a musty room, comes me the Prince and Claudio, hand in hand in sad conference. I whipt me behind the arras, and there heard it agreed upon that the Prince should woo Hero for himself, and having obtain&#8217;d her, give her to Count Claudio.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>D. JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, come, let us thither, this may prove food to my displeasure. That young start-up hath all the glory of my overthrow. If I can cross him any way, I bless myself every way. You are both sure, and will assist me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To the death, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>D. JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let us to the great supper, their cheer is the greater that I am subdu&#8217;d. Would the cook were a&#8217; my mind! Shall we go prove what&#8217;s to be done?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BORA.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We&#8217;ll wait upon your lordship.</LINE>

<SCENEPERSONAE>(Leonato, Antonio, Hero, Beatrice, Margaret, Ursula, Kinsman, Prince Don Pedro, Claudio, Benedick, Don John, Borachio)</SCENEPERSONAE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Leonato, Antonio his brother, Hero his daughter, and Beatrice his niece, Margaret, Ursula, and a Kinsman.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Was not Count John here at supper?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I saw him not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEAT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How tartly that gentleman looks! I never can see him but I am heart-burn&#8217;d an hour after.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HERO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He is of a very melancholy disposition.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEAT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He were an excellent man that were made just in the midway between him and Benedick: the one is too like an image and says nothing, and the other too like my lady&#8217;s eldest son, evermore tattling.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then half Signior Benedick&#8217;s tongue in Count John&#8217;s mouth, and half Count John&#8217;s melancholy in Signior Benedick&#8217;s face&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEAT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>With a good leg and a good foot, uncle, and money enough in his purse, such a man would win any woman in the world, if &#8217;a could get her good will.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By my troth, niece, thou wilt never get thee a husband, if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In faith, she&#8217;s too curst.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEAT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Too curst is more than curst. I shall lessen God&#8217;s sending that way, for it is said, &#8220;God sends a curst cow short horns&#8221;&#8212;but to a cow too curst he sends none.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So, by being too curst, God will send you no horns.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEAT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Just, if he send me no husband, for the which blessing I am at him upon my knees every morning and evening. Lord, I could not endure a husband with a beard on his face, I had rather lie in the woollen!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You may light on a husband that hath no beard.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEAT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What should I do with him? Dress him in my apparel and make him my waiting-gentlewoman? He that hath a beard is more than a youth, and he that hath no beard is less than a man; and he that is more than a youth is not for me, and he that is less than a man, I am not for him; therefore I will even take sixpence in earnest of the berrord, and lead his apes into hell.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well then, go you into hell.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEAT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, but to the gate, and there will the devil meet me like an old cuckold with horns on his head, and say, &#8220;Get you to heaven, Beatrice, get you to heaven, here&#8217;s no place for you maids.&#8221; So deliver I up my apes, and away to Saint Peter. For the heavens, he shows me where the bachelors sit, and there live we as merry as the day is long.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANT.</SPEAKER>
<STAGEDIR>To Hero.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Well, niece, I trust you will be rul&#8217;d by your father.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEAT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, faith, it is my cousin&#8217;s duty to make cur&#8217;sy and say, &#8220;Father, as it please you.&#8221; But yet for all that, cousin, let him be a handsome fellow, or else make another cur&#8217;sy and say, &#8220;Father, as it please me.&#8221;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, niece, I hope to see you one day fitted with a husband.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEAT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not till God make men of some other mettle than earth. Would it not grieve a woman to be overmaster&#8217;d with a piece of valiant dust? To make an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl? No, uncle, I&#8217;ll none. Adam&#8217;s sons are my brethren, and truly I hold it a sin to match in my kinred.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Daughter, remember what I told you. If the Prince do solicit you in that kind, you know your answer.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEAT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The fault will be in the music, cousin, if you be not woo&#8217;d in good time. If the Prince be too important, tell him there is measure in every thing, and so dance out the answer. For hear me, Hero: wooing, wedding, and repenting, is as a Scotch jig, a measure, and a cinquepace; the first suit is hot and hasty, like a Scotch jig, and full as fantastical; the wedding, mannerly-modest, as a measure, full of state and ancientry; and then comes repentance, and with his bad legs falls into the cinquepace faster and faster, till he sink into his grave.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Cousin, you apprehend passing shrewdly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEAT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have a good eye, uncle, I can see a church by daylight.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The revellers are ent&#8217;ring, brother, make good room.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>They put on their masks.</STAGEDIR>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Prince Don Pedro, Claudio, and Benedick, and Don John, and Borachio as maskers, with a Drum.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>D. PEDRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Lady, will you walk about with your friend?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HERO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So you walk softly, and look sweetly, and say nothing, I am yours for the walk, and especially when I walk away.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>D. PEDRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>With me in your company?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HERO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I may say so when I please.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>D. PEDRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And when please you to say so?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HERO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>When I like your favor, for God defend the lute should be like the case!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>D. PEDRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My visor is Philemon&#8217;s roof, within the house is Jove.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HERO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why then your visor should be thatch&#8217;d.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>D. PEDRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Speak low if you speak love.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>They move aside.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BORA.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, I would you did like me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARG.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So would not I for your own sake, for I have many ill qualities.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BORA.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Which is one?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARG.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I say my prayers aloud.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BORA.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I love you the better; the hearers may cry amen.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARG.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>God match me with a good dancer!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BORA.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Amen.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARG.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And God keep him out of my sight when the dance is done! Answer, clerk.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BORA.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No more words; the clerk is answer&#8217;d.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>They move aside.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEAKER>URS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know you well enough, you are Signior Antonio.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>At a word, I am not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>URS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know you by the waggling of your head.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To tell you true, I counterfeit him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>URS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You could never do him so ill-well, unless you were the very man. Here&#8217;s his dry hand up and down. You are he, you are he.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>At a word, I am not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>URS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, come, do you think I do not know you by your excellent wit? Can virtue hide itself? Go to, mum, you are he. Graces will appear, and there&#8217;s an end.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>They move aside.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEAT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Will you not tell me who told you so?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, you shall pardon me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEAT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nor will you not tell me who you are?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not now.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEAT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That I was disdainful, and that I had my good wit out of the &#8220;Hundred Merry Tales&#8221;&#8212;well, this was Signior Benedick that said so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What&#8217;s he?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEAT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am sure you know him well enough.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not I, believe me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEAT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Did he never make you laugh?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I pray you, what is he?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEAT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, he is the Prince&#8217;s jester, a very dull fool; only his gift is in devising impossible slanders. None but libertines delight in him, and the commendation is not in his wit, but in his villainy, for he both pleases men and angers them, and then they laugh at him and beat him. I am sure he is in the fleet; I would he had boarded me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>When I know the gentleman, I&#8217;ll tell him what you say.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEAT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do, do, he&#8217;ll but break a comparison or two on me, which peradventure, not mark&#8217;d, or not laugh&#8217;d at, strikes him into melancholy, and then there&#8217;s a partridge wing sav&#8217;d, for the fool will eat no supper that night.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Music for the dance begins.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>We must follow the leaders.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In every good thing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEAT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, if they lead to any ill, I will leave them at the next turning.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Dance. Then exeunt all but Don John, Borachio, and Claudio.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>D. JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sure my brother is amorous on Hero, and hath withdrawn her father to break with him about it. The ladies follow her, and but one visor remains.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BORA.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And that is Claudio. I know him by his bearing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>D. JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Are not you Signior Benedick?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You know me well, I am he.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>D. JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Signior, you are very near my brother in his love. He is enamor&#8217;d on Hero. I pray you dissuade him from her, she is no equal for his birth. You may do the part of an honest man in it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How know you he loves her?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>D. JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I heard him swear his affection.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BORA.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So did I too, and he swore he would marry her tonight.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>D. JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come let us to the banquet.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt. Manet Claudio.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thus answer I in name of Benedick,</LINE>
<LINE>But hear these ill news with the ears of Claudio.</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis certain so, the Prince woos for himself.</LINE>
<LINE>Friendship is constant in all other things</LINE>
<LINE>Save in the office and affairs of love;</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore all hearts in love use their own tongues.</LINE>
<LINE>Let every eye negotiate for itself,</LINE>
<LINE>And trust no agent; for beauty is a witch</LINE>
<LINE>Against whose charms faith melteth into blood.</LINE>
<LINE>This is an accident of hourly proof,</LINE>
<LINE>Which I mistrusted not. Farewell therefore Hero!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Benedick.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Count Claudio?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yea, the same.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, will you go with me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Whither?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Even to the next willow, about your own business, County. What fashion will you wear the garland of? About your neck, like an usurer&#8217;s chain? Or under your arm, like a lieutenant&#8217;s scarf? You must wear it one way, for the Prince hath got your Hero.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I wish him joy of her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, that&#8217;s spoken like an honest drovier; so they sell bullocks. But did you think the Prince would have serv&#8217;d you thus?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I pray you leave me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ho, now you strike like the blind man. &#8217;Twas the boy that stole your meat, and You&#8217;ll beat the post.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If it will not be, I&#8217;ll leave you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alas, poor hurt fowl, now will he creep into sedges. But that my Lady Beatrice should know me, and not know me! The Prince&#8217;s fool! Hah, it may be I go under that title because I am merry. Yea, but so I am apt to do myself wrong. I am not so reputed. It is the base (though bitter) disposition of Beatrice that puts the world into her person, and so gives me out. Well, I&#8217;ll be reveng&#8217;d as I may.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter the Prince Don Pedro.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>D. PEDRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, signior, where&#8217;s the Count? Did you see him?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Troth, my lord, I have play&#8217;d the part of Lady Fame. I found him here as melancholy as a lodge in a warren. I told him, and I think I told him true, that your Grace had got the good will of this young lady, and I off&#8217;red him my company to a willow-tree, either to make him a garland, as being forsaken, or to bind him up a rod, as being worthy to be whipt.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>D. PEDRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To be whipt? What&#8217;s his fault?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The flat transgression of a schoolboy, who being overjoy&#8217;d with finding a bird&#8217;s nest, shows it his companion, and he steals it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>D. PEDRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Wilt thou make a trust a transgression? The transgression is in the stealer.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>The Lady Beatrice hath a quarrel to you. The gentleman that danc&#8217;d with her told her she is much wrong&#8217;d by you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, she misus&#8217;d me past the endurance of a block; an oak but with one green leaf on it would have answer&#8217;d her. My very visor began to assume life, and scold with her. She told me, not thinking I had been myself, that I was the Prince&#8217;s jester, that I was duller than a great thaw, huddling jest upon jest with such impossible conveyance upon me that I stood like a man at a mark, with a whole army shooting at me. She speaks poniards, and every word stabs. If her breath were as terrible as her terminations, there were no living near her, she would infect to the north star. I would not marry her, though she were endow&#8217;d with all that Adam had left him before he transgress&#8217;d. She would have made Hercules have turn&#8217;d spit, yea, and have cleft his club to make the fire too. Come, talk not of her; you shall find her the infernal Ate in good apparel. I would to God some scholar would conjure her, for certainly, while she is here, a man may live as quiet in hell as in a sanctuary, and people sin upon purpose, because they would go thither; so indeed all disquiet, horror, and perturbation follows her.</LINE>

<LINE>Will your Grace command me any service to the world&#8217;s end? I will go on the slightest arrand now to the Antipodes that you can devise to send me on; I will fetch you a toothpicker now from the furthest inch of Asia, bring you the length of Prester John&#8217;s foot, fetch you a hair off the great Cham&#8217;s beard, do you any embassage to the Pigmies, rather than hold three words&#8217; conference with this harpy. You have no employment for me?</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEAT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Indeed, my lord, he lent it me awhile, and I gave him use for it, a double heart for his single one. Marry, once before he won it of me with false dice, therefore your Grace may well say I have lost it.</LINE>

<LINE>You have put him down, lady, you have put him down.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>So I would not he should do me, my lord, lest I should prove the mother of fools. I have brought Count Claudio, whom you sent me to seek.</LINE>

<LINE>Why, how now, Count, wherefore are you sad?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Neither, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>The Count is neither sad, nor sick, nor merry, nor well; but civil count, civil as an orange, and something of that jealous complexion.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>D. PEDRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I&#8217; faith, lady, I think your blazon to be true, though I&#8217;ll be sworn, if he be so, his conceit is false. Here, Claudio, I have woo&#8217;d in thy name, and fair Hero is won. I have broke with her father, and his good will obtain&#8217;d. Name the day of marriage, and God give thee joy!</LINE>

<LINE>Speak, Count, &#8217;tis your cue.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Silence is the perfectest heralt of joy; I were but little happy, if I could say how much! Lady, as you are mine, I am yours. I give away myself for you, and dote upon the exchange.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEAT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Speak, cousin, or (if you cannot) stop his mouth with a kiss, and let not him speak neither.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>In faith, lady, you have a merry heart.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEAT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yea, my lord, I thank it&#8212;poor fool, it keeps on the windy side of care. My cousin tells him in his ear that he is in her heart.</LINE>

<LINE>And so she doth, cousin.</LINE>

<SPEECH>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>D. PEDRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Will you have me, lady?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEAT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, my lord, unless I might have another for working-days. Your Grace is too costly to wear every day. But I beseech your Grace pardon me, I was born to speak all mirth and no matter.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>D. PEDRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your silence most offends me, and to be merry best becomes you, for out a&#8217; question, you were born in a merry hour.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEAT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, sure, my lord, my mother cried, but then there was a star danc&#8217;d, and under that was I born. Cousins, God give you joy!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>By my troth, a pleasant-spirited lady.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There&#8217;s little of the melancholy element in her, my lord. She is never sad but when she sleeps, and not ever sad then; for I have heard my daughter say, she hath often dreamt of unhappiness, and wak&#8217;d herself with laughing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>D. PEDRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She cannot endure to hear tell of a husband.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Not till Monday, my dear son, which is hence a just sevennight, and a time too brief too, to have all things answer my mind.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>D. PEDRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, you shake the head at so long a breathing, but I warrant thee, Claudio, the time shall not go dully by us. I will in the interim undertake one of Hercules&#8217; labors, which is, to bring Signior Benedick and the Lady Beatrice into a mountain of affection th&#8217; one with th&#8217; other. I would fain have it a match, and I doubt not but to fashion it, if you three will but minister such assistance as I shall give you direction.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>My lord, I am for you, though it cost me ten nights&#8217; watchings.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HERO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will do any modest office, my lord, to help my cousin to a good husband.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>D. PEDRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And Benedick is not the unhopefullest husband that I know. Thus far can I praise him: he is of a noble strain, of approv&#8217;d valor, and confirm&#8217;d honesty. I will teach you how to humor your cousin, that she shall fall in love with Benedick, and I, with your two helps, will so practice on Benedick that, in despite of his quick wit and his queasy stomach, he shall fall in love with Beatrice. If we can do this, Cupid is no longer an archer; his glory shall be ours, for we are the only love-gods. Go in with me, and I will tell you my drift.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>D. JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Any bar, any cross, any impediment will be med&#8217;cinable to me. I am sick in displeasure to him, and whatsoever comes athwart his affection ranges evenly with mine. How canst thou cross this marriage?</LINE>

<LINE>What life is in that, to be the death of this marriage?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BORA.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The poison of that lies in you to temper. Go you to the Prince your brother; spare not to tell him that he hath wrong&#8217;d his honor in marrying the renown&#8217;d Claudio&#8212;whose estimation do you mightily hold up&#8212;to a contaminated stale, such a one as Hero.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>D. JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What proof shall I make of that?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Only to despite them, I will endeavor any thing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BORA.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go then, find me a meet hour to draw Don Pedro and the Count Claudio alone, tell them that you know that Hero loves me, intend a kind of zeal both to the Prince and Claudio&#8212;as in love of your brother&#8217;s honor, who hath made this match, and his friend&#8217;s reputation, who is thus like to be cozen&#8217;d with the semblance of a maid&#8212;that you have discover&#8217;d thus. They will scarcely believe this without trial. Offer them instances, which shall bear no less likelihood than to see me at her chamber-window, hear me call Margaret Hero, hear Margaret term me Claudio; and bring them to see this the very night, before the intended wedding&#8212;for in the mean time I will so fashion the matter that Hero shall be absent&#8212;and there shall appear such seeming truth of Hero&#8217;s disloyalty, that jealousy shall be call&#8217;d assurance, and all the preparation overthrown.</LINE>

<LINE>I know that, but I would have thee hence, and here again. I do much wonder that one man, seeing how much another man is a fool when he dedicates his behaviors to love, will, after he hath laugh&#8217;d at such shallow follies in others, become the argument of his own scorn by falling in love&#8212;and such a man is Claudio. I have known when there was no music with him but the drum and the fife, and now had he rather hear the tabor and the pipe; I have known when he would have walk&#8217;d ten mile afoot to see a good armor, and now will he lie ten nights awake carving the fashion of a new doublet; he was wont to speak plain and to the purpose (like an honest man and a soldier), and now is he turn&#8217;d ortography&#8212;his words are a very fantastical banquet, just so many strange dishes. May I be so converted and see with these eyes? I cannot tell; I think not. I will not be sworn but love may transform me to an oyster, but I&#8217;ll take my oath on it, till he have made an oyster of me, he shall never make me such a fool. One woman is fair, yet I am well; another is wise, yet I am well; another virtuous, yet I am well; but till all graces be in one woman, one woman shall not come in my grace. Rich she shall be, that&#8217;s certain; wise, or I&#8217;ll none; virtuous, or I&#8217;ll never cheapen her; fair, or I&#8217;ll never look on her; mild, or come not near me; noble, or not I for an angel; of good discourse, an excellent musician, and her hair shall be of what color it please God. Hah! The Prince and Monsieur Love. I will hide me in the arbor.</LINE>

<LINE>O, when she had writ it, and was reading it over, she found &#8220;Benedick&#8221; and &#8220;Beatrice&#8221; between the sheet?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, she tore the letter into a thousand half-pence; rail&#8217;d at herself, that she should be so immodest to write to one that she knew would flout her. &#8220;I measure him,&#8221; says she, &#8220;by my own spirit, for I should flout him, if he writ to me, yea, though I love him, I should.&#8221;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then down upon her knees she falls, weeps, sobs, beats her heart, tears her hair, prays, curses: &#8220;O sweet Benedick! God give me patience!&#8221;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She doth indeed, my daughter says so; and the ecstasy hath so much overborne her that my daughter is sometime afeard she will do a desperate outrage to herself. It is very true.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>D. PEDRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It were good that Benedick knew of it by some other, if she will not discover it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To what end? He would make but a sport of it, and torment the poor lady worse.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>D. PEDRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And he should, it were an alms to hang him. She&#8217;s an excellent sweet lady, and (out of all suspicion) she is virtuous.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And she is exceeding wise.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>D. PEDRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In every thing but in loving Benedick.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O my lord, wisdom and blood combating in so tender a body, we have ten proofs to one that blood hath the victory. I am sorry for her, as I have just cause, being her uncle and her guardian.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>D. PEDRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would she had bestow&#8217;d this dotage on me, I would have daff&#8217;d all other respects, and made her half myself. I pray you tell Benedick of it, and hear what &#8217;a will say.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Were it good, think you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hero thinks surely she will die, for she says she will die if he love her not, and she will die ere she make her love known, and she will die if he woo her, rather than she will bate one breath of her accustom&#8217;d crossness.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>D. PEDRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She doth well. If she should make tender of her love, &#8217;tis very possible he&#8217;ll scorn it, for the man (as you know all) hath a contemptible spirit.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He is a very proper man.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>D. PEDRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He hath indeed a good outward happiness.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Before God, and in my mind, very wise.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>D. PEDRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And I take him to be valiant.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>D. PEDRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As Hector, I assure you, and in the managing of quarrels you may say he is wise, for either he avoids them with great discretion, or undertakes them with a most Christian-like fear.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If he do fear God, &#8217;a must necessarily keep peace; if he break the peace, he ought to enter into a quarrel with fear and trembling.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>D. PEDRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And so will he do, for the man doth fear God, howsoever it seems not in him by some large jests he will make. Well, I am sorry for your niece. Shall we go seek Benedick, and tell him of her love?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Never tell him, my lord. Let her wear it out with good counsel.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, that&#8217;s impossible, she may wear her heart out first.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>D. PEDRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, we will hear further of it by your daughter, let it cool the while. I love Benedick well, and I could wish he would modestly examine himself, to see how much he is unworthy so good a lady.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, will you walk? Dinner is ready.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUD.</SPEAKER>
<STAGEDIR>Aside.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>If he do not dote on her upon this, I will never trust my expectation.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>D. PEDRO.</SPEAKER>
<STAGEDIR>Aside.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Let there be the same net spread for her, and that must your daughter and her gentlewomen carry. The sport will be, when they hold one an opinion of another&#8217;s dotage, and no such matter; that&#8217;s the scene that I would see, which will be merely a dumb show. Let us send her to call him in to dinner.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt Don Pedro, Claudio, and Leonato.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENE.</SPEAKER>
<STAGEDIR>Coming forward.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>This can be no trick: the conference was sadly borne; they have the truth of this from Hero; they seem to pity the lady. It seems her affections have their full bent. Love me? Why, it must be requited. I hear how I am censur&#8217;d; they say I will bear myself proudly, if I perceive the love come from her; they say too that she will rather die than give any sign of affection. I did never think to marry. I must not seem proud; happy are they that hear their detractions, and can put them to mending. They say the lady is fair; &#8217;tis a truth, I can bear them witness; and virtuous; &#8217;tis so, I cannot reprove it; and wise, but for loving me; by my troth, it is no addition to her wit, nor no great argument of her folly, for I will be horribly in love with her. I may chance have some odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me, because I have rail&#8217;d so long against marriage; but doth not the appetite alter? A man loves the meat in his youth that he cannot endure in his age. Shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of the brain awe a man from the career of his humor? No, the world must be peopled. When I said I would die a bachelor, I did not think I should live till I were married. Here comes Beatrice. By this day, she&#8217;s a fair lady. I do spy some marks of love in her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Beatrice.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEAT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fair Beatrice, I thank you for your pains.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEAT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I took no more pains for those thanks than you take pains to thank me. If it had been painful, I would not have come.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You take pleasure then in the message?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEAT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yea, just so much as you may take upon a knive&#8217;s point, and choke a daw withal. You have no stomach, signior, fare you well.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ha! &#8220;Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner&#8221;&#8212;there&#8217;s a double meaning in that. &#8220;I took no more pains for those thanks than you took pains to thank me&#8221;&#8212;that&#8217;s as much as to say, &#8220;Any pains that I take for you is as easy as thanks.&#8221; If I do not take pity of her, I am a villain; if I do not love her, I am a Jew. I will go get her picture.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Hero and two gentlewomen, Margaret and Ursley.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HERO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good Margaret, run thee to the parlor,</LINE>
<LINE>There shalt thou find my cousin Beatrice</LINE>
<LINE>Proposing with the Prince and Claudio.</LINE>
<LINE>Whisper her ear, and tell her I and Ursley</LINE>
<LINE>Walk in the orchard, and our whole discourse</LINE>
<LINE>Is all of her. Say that thou overheardst us,</LINE>
<LINE>And bid her steal into the pleached bower,</LINE>
<LINE>Where honeysuckles, ripened by the sun,</LINE>
<LINE>Forbid the sun to enter, like favorites</LINE>
<LINE>Made proud by princes, that advance their pride</LINE>
<LINE>Against that power that bred it. There will she hide her,</LINE>
<LINE>To listen our propose. This is thy office;</LINE>
<LINE>Bear thee well in it, and leave us alone.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARG.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll make her come, I warrant you, presently.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HERO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, Ursula, when Beatrice doth come,</LINE>
<LINE>As we do trace this alley up and down,</LINE>
<LINE>Our talk must only be of Benedick.</LINE>
<LINE>When I do name him, let it be thy part</LINE>
<LINE>To praise him more than ever man did merit.</LINE>
<LINE>My talk to thee must be how Benedick</LINE>
<LINE>Is sick in love with Beatrice. Of this matter</LINE>
<LINE>Is little Cupid&#8217;s crafty arrow made,</LINE>
<LINE>That only wounds by hearsay.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Beatrice behind.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE offset="6">Now begin,</LINE>
<LINE>For look where Beatrice like a lapwing runs</LINE>
<LINE>Close by the ground, to hear our conference.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>URS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The pleasant&#8217;st angling is to see the fish</LINE>
<LINE>Cut with her golden oars the silver stream,</LINE>
<LINE>And greedily devour the treacherous bait;</LINE>
<LINE>So angle we for Beatrice, who even now</LINE>
<LINE>Is couched in the woodbine coverture.</LINE>
<LINE>Fear you not my part of the dialogue.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HERO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then go we near her, that her ear lose nothing</LINE>
<LINE>Of the false sweet bait that we lay for it.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>They advance to the bower.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>No, truly, Ursula, she is too disdainful,</LINE>
<LINE>I know her spirits are as coy and wild</LINE>
<LINE>As haggards of the rock.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>URS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">But are you sure</LINE>
<LINE>That Benedick loves Beatrice so entirely?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HERO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So says the Prince and my new-trothed lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>URS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And did they bid you tell her of it, madam?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HERO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>They did entreat me to acquaint her of it,</LINE>
<LINE>But I persuaded them, if they lov&#8217;d Benedick,</LINE>
<LINE>To wish him wrastle with affection,</LINE>
<LINE>And never to let Beatrice know of it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>URS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why did you so? Doth not the gentleman</LINE>
<LINE>Deserve as full as fortunate a bed</LINE>
<LINE>As ever Beatrice shall couch upon?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HERO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O god of love! I know he doth deserve</LINE>
<LINE>As much as may be yielded to a man;</LINE>
<LINE>But nature never fram&#8217;d a woman&#8217;s heart</LINE>
<LINE>Of prouder stuff than that of Beatrice.</LINE>
<LINE>Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>Misprising what they look on, and her wit</LINE>
<LINE>Values itself so highly that to her</LINE>
<LINE>All matter else seems weak. She cannot love,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor take no shape nor project of affection,</LINE>
<LINE>She is so self-endeared.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>URS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Sure I think so,</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore certainly it were not good</LINE>
<LINE>She knew his love, lest she&#8217;ll make sport at it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HERO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, you speak truth. I never yet saw man,</LINE>
<LINE>How wise, how noble, young, how rarely featur&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>But she would spell him backward. If fair-fac&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>She would swear the gentleman should be her sister;</LINE>
<LINE>If black, why, Nature, drawing of an antic,</LINE>
<LINE>Made a foul blot; if tall, a lance ill-headed;</LINE>
<LINE>If low, an agot very vildly cut;</LINE>
<LINE>If speaking, why, a vane blown with all winds;</LINE>
<LINE>If silent, why, a block moved with none.</LINE>
<LINE>So turns she every man the wrong side out,</LINE>
<LINE>And never gives to truth and virtue that</LINE>
<LINE>Which simpleness and merit purchaseth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>URS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sure, sure, such carping is not commendable.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HERO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, not to be so odd, and from all fashions,</LINE>
<LINE>As Beatrice is, cannot be commendable.</LINE>
<LINE>But who dare tell her so? If I should speak,</LINE>
<LINE>She would mock me into air; O, she would laugh me</LINE>
<LINE>Out of myself, press me to death with wit.</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore let Benedick, like cover&#8217;d fire,</LINE>
<LINE>Consume away in sighs, waste inwardly.</LINE>
<LINE>It were a better death than die with mocks,</LINE>
<LINE>Which is as bad as die with tickling.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>URS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yet tell her of it, hear what she will say.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HERO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, rather I will go to Benedick,</LINE>
<LINE>And counsel him to fight against his passion,</LINE>
<LINE>And truly I&#8217;ll devise some honest slanders</LINE>
<LINE>To stain my cousin with. One doth not know</LINE>
<LINE>How much an ill word may empoison liking.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>URS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, do not do your cousin such a wrong.</LINE>
<LINE>She cannot be so much without true judgment&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Having so swift and excellent a wit</LINE>
<LINE>As she is priz&#8217;d to have&#8212;as to refuse</LINE>
<LINE>So rare a gentleman as Signior Benedick.</LINE>

<LINE>For shape, for bearing, argument, and valor,</LINE>
<LINE>Goes foremost in report through Italy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HERO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Indeed he hath an excellent good name.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>D. PEDRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, that would be as great a soil in the new gloss of your marriage as to show a child his new coat and forbid him to wear it. I will only be bold with Benedick for his company, for from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot, he is all mirth. He hath twice or thrice cut Cupid&#8217;s bow-string, and the little hangman dare not shoot at him. He hath a heart as sound as a bell, and his tongue is the clapper, for what his heart thinks, his tongue speaks.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>D. PEDRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There is no appearance of fancy in him, unless it be a fancy that he hath to strange disguises&#8212;as to be a Dutchman today, a Frenchman tomorrow, or in the shape of two countries at once, as a German from the waist downward, all slops, and a Spaniard from the hip upward, no doublet. Unless he have a fancy to this foolery, as it appears he hath, he is no fool for fancy, as you would have it appear he is.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If he be not in love with some woman, there is no believing old signs. &#8217;A brushes his hat a&#8217; mornings; what should that bode?</LINE>

<LINE>Hath any man seen him at the barber&#8217;s?</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>No, but the barber&#8217;s man hath been seen with him, and the old ornament of his cheek hath already stuff&#8217;d tennis-balls.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Indeed he looks younger than he did, by the loss of a beard.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>Nay, &#8217;a rubs himself with civet. Can you smell him out by that?</LINE>

<LINE>Yea, or to paint himself? For the which I hear what they say of him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, but his jesting spirit, which is now crept into a lute-string, and now govern&#8217;d by stops.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>D. PEDRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Indeed that tells a heavy tale for him. Conclude, conclude, he is in love.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, but I know who loves him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>I came hither to tell you, and circumstances short&#8217;ned (for she has been too long a-talking of), the lady is disloyal.</LINE>

<LINE>Disloyal?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>D. JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The word is too good to paint out her wickedness. I could say she were worse; think you of a worse title, and I will fit her to it. Wonder not till further warrant. Go but with me tonight, you shall see her chamber-window ent&#8217;red, even the night before her wedding-day. If you love her then, tomorrow wed her; but it would better fit your honor to change your mind.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Dogberry and his compartner Verges with the Watch.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOG.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Are you good men and true?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VERG.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yea, or else it were pity but they should suffer salvation, body and soul.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOG.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, that were a punishment too good for them, if they should have any allegiance in them, being chosen for the Prince&#8217;s watch.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VERG.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, give them their charge, neighbor Dogberry.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOG.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>First, who think you the most desartless man to be constable?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. WATCH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hugh Oatcake, sir, or George Seacole, for they can write and read.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOG.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come hither, neighbor Seacole. God hath blest you with a good name. To be a well-favor&#8217;d man is the gift of fortune, but to write and read comes by nature.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. WATCH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Both which, Master Constable&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOG.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You have: I knew it would be your answer. Well, for your favor, sir, why, give God thanks, and make no boast of it, and for your writing and reading, let that appear when there is no need of such vanity. You are thought here to be the most senseless and fit man for the constable of the watch; therefore bear you the lanthorn. This is your charge: you shall comprehend all vagrom men; you are to bid any man stand, in the Prince&#8217;s name.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. WATCH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How if &#8217;a will not stand?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOG.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why then take no note of him, but let him go, and presently call the rest of the watch together, and thank God you are rid of a knave.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VERG.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If he will not stand when he is bidden, he is none of the Prince&#8217;s subjects.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOG.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>True, and they are to meddle with none but the Prince&#8217;s subjects. You shall also make no noise in the streets; for, for the watch to babble and to talk, is most tolerable, and not to be endur&#8217;d.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. WATCH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We will rather sleep than talk, we know what belongs to a watch.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOG.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, you speak like an ancient and most quiet watchman, for I cannot see how sleeping should offend; only have a care that your bills be not stol&#8217;n. Well, you are to call at all the alehouses, and bid those that are drunk get them to bed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. WATCH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How if they will not?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOG.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why then let them alone till they are sober. If they make you not then the better answer, you may say they are not the men you took them for.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. WATCH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOG.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If you meet a thief, you may suspect him, by virtue of your office, to be no true man; and for such kind of men, the less you meddle or make with them, why, the more is for your honesty.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. WATCH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If we know him to be a thief, shall we not lay hands on him?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOG.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Truly by your office you may, but I think they that touch pitch will be defil&#8217;d. The most peaceable way for you, if you do take a thief, is to let him show himself what he is, and steal out of your company.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VERG.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You have been always call&#8217;d a merciful man, partner.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOG.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Truly, I would not hang a dog by my will, much more a man who hath any honesty in him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VERG.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If you hear a child cry in the night, you must call to the nurse and bid her still it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. WATCH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How if the nurse be asleep and will not hear us?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOG.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why then depart in peace, and let the child wake her with crying, for the ewe that will not hear her lamb when it baes will never answer a calf when he bleats.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VERG.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis very true.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOG.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This is the end of the charge: you, constable, are to present the Prince&#8217;s own person. If you meet the Prince in the night, you may stay him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VERG.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, by&#8217;r lady, that I think &#8217;a cannot.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOG.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Five shillings to one on&#8217;t, with any man that knows the statutes, he may stay him; marry, not without the Prince be willing, for indeed the watch ought to offend no man, and it is an offense to stay a man against his will.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VERG.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By&#8217;r lady, I think it be so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOG.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ha, ah ha! Well, masters, good night. And there be any matter of weight chances, call up me. Keep your fellows&#8217; counsels and your own, and good night. Come, neighbor.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. WATCH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, masters, we hear our charge. Let us go sit here upon the church-bench till two, and then all to bed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOG.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>One word more, honest neighbors. I pray you watch about Signior Leonato&#8217;s door, for the wedding being there tomorrow, there is a great coil tonight. <FRENCH lang="fr">Adieu</FRENCH>! Be vigitant, I beseech you.</LINE>

<LINE>I will owe thee an answer for that, and now forward with thy tale.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>BORA.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Therefore know I have earn&#8217;d of Don John a thousand ducats.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is it possible that any villainy should be so dear?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BORA.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou shouldst rather ask if it were possible any villainy should be so rich; for when rich villains have need of poor ones, poor ones may make what price they will.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I wonder at it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BORA.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That shows thou art unconfirm&#8217;d. Thou knowest that the fashion of a doublet, or a hat, or a cloak, is nothing to a man.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, it is apparel.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BORA.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I mean the fashion.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, the fashion is the fashion.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BORA.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tush, I may as well say the fool&#8217;s the fool. But seest thou not what a deformed thief this fashion is?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. WATCH</SPEAKER>
<STAGEDIR>Aside.</STAGEDIR> 
<LINE>I know that Deformed; &#8217;a has been a vile thief this seven year; &#8217;a goes up and down like a gentleman. I remember his name.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BORA.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Didst thou not hear somebody?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, &#8217;twas the vane on the house.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BORA.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Seest thou not, I say, what a deformed thief this fashion is, how giddily &#8217;a turns about all the hot-bloods between fourteen and five-and-thirty, sometimes fashioning them like Pharaoh&#8217;s soldiers in the reechy painting, sometime like god Bel&#8217;s priests in the old church-window, sometime like the shaven Hercules in the smirch&#8217;d worm-eaten tapestry, where his codpiece seems as massy as his club?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>All this I see, and I see that the fashion wears out more apparel than the man. But art not thou thyself giddy with the fashion too, that thou hast shifted out of thy tale into telling me of the fashion?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BORA.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not so neither, but know that I have tonight woo&#8217;d Margaret, the Lady Hero&#8217;s gentlewoman, by the name of Hero. She leans me out at her mistress&#8217; chamber-window, bids me a thousand times good night&#8212;I tell this tale vildly, I should first tell thee how the Prince, Claudio, and my master, planted and plac&#8217;d and possess&#8217;d by my master Don John, saw afar off in the orchard this amiable encounter.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And thought they Margaret was Hero?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BORA.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Two of them did, the Prince and Claudio, but the devil my master knew she was Margaret; and partly by his oaths, which first possess&#8217;d them, partly by the dark night, which did deceive them, but chiefly by my villainy, which did confirm any slander that Don John had made, away went Claudio enrag&#8217;d; swore he would meet her as he was appointed next morning at the temple, and there, before the whole congregation, shame her with what he saw o&#8217;ernight, and send her home again without a husband.</LINE>

Is there any harm in &#8220;the heavier for a husband&#8221;? None, I think, and it be the right husband and the right wife; otherwise &#8217;tis light, and not heavy.

Yet Benedick was such another, and now is he become a man. He swore he would never marry, and yet now in despite of his heart he eats his meat without grudging; and how you may be converted I know not, but methinks you look with your eyes as other women do.</LINE>

<LINE>Goodman Verges, sir, speaks a little off the matter; an old man, sir, and his wits are not so blunt as, God help, I would desire they were, but in faith, honest as the skin between his brows.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VERG.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, I thank God I am as honest as any man living, that is an old man, and no honester than I.</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Comparisons are odorous&#8212;palabras, neighbor Verges.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Neighbors, you are tedious.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOG.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It pleases your worship to say so, but we are the poor Duke&#8217;s officers; but truly, for mine own part, if I were as tedious as a king, I could find in my heart to bestow it all of your worship.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>All thy tediousness on me, ah?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOG.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yea, and &#8217;twere a thousand pound more than &#8217;tis, for I hear as good exclamation on your worship as of any man in the city, and though I be but a poor man, I am glad to hear it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VERG.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And so am I.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would fain know what you have to say.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VERG.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, sir, our watch tonight, excepting your worship&#8217;s presence, ha&#8217; ta&#8217;en a couple of as arrant knaves as any in Messina.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOG.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A good old man, sir, he will be talking; as they say, &#8220;When the age is in, the wit is out.&#8221; God help us, it is a world to see! Well said, i&#8217; faith, neighbor Verges. Well, God&#8217;s a good man; and two men ride of a horse, one must ride behind. An honest soul, i&#8217; faith, sir, by my troth he is, as ever broke bread; but God is to be worshipp&#8217;d; all men are not alike, alas, good neighbor!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Indeed, neighbor, he comes too short of you.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I must leave you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOG.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>One word, sir. Our watch, sir, have indeed comprehended two aspicious persons, and we would have them this morning examin&#8217;d before your worship.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Take their examination yourself, and bring it me. I am now in great haste, as it may appear unto you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOG.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It shall be suffigance.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>My lord, they stay for you to give your daughter to her husband.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOG.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go, good partner, go, get you to Francis Seacole, bid him bring his pen and inkhorn to the jail. We are now to examination these men.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VERG.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And we must do it wisely.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOG.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We will spare for no wit, I warrant you. Here&#8217;s that shall drive some of them to a non-come; only get the learned writer to set down our excommunication, and meet me at the jail.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If either of you know any inward impediment why you should not be conjoin&#8217;d, I charge you on your souls to utter it.</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Know you any, Count?</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I dare make his answer, none.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Stand thee by, friar. Father, by your leave,</LINE>
<LINE>Will you with free and unconstrained soul</LINE>
<LINE>Give me this maid, your daughter?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As freely, son, as God did give her me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And what have I to give you back whose worth</LINE>
<LINE>May counterpoise this rich and precious gift?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>D. PEDRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nothing, unless you render her again.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sweet Prince, you learn me noble thankfulness.</LINE>
<LINE>There, Leonato, take her back again.</LINE>
<LINE>Give not this rotten orange to your friend,</LINE>
<LINE>She&#8217;s but the sign and semblance of her honor.</LINE>
<LINE>Behold how like a maid she blushes here!</LINE>
<LINE>O, what authority and show of truth</LINE>
<LINE>Can cunning sin cover itself withal!</LINE>
<LINE>Comes not that blood as modest evidence</LINE>
<LINE>To witness simple virtue? Would you not swear,</LINE>
<LINE>All you that see her, that she were a maid,</LINE>
<LINE>By these exterior shows? But she is none:</LINE>
<LINE>She knows the heat of a luxurious bed;</LINE>
<LINE>Her blush is guiltiness, not modesty.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What do you mean, my lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">Not to be married,</LINE>
<LINE>Not to knit my soul to an approved wanton.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Dear my lord, if you, in your own proof,</LINE>
<LINE>Have vanquish&#8217;d the resistance of her youth,</LINE>
<LINE>And made defeat of her virginity&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know what you would say. If I have known her,</LINE>
<LINE>You will say, she did embrace me as a husband,</LINE>
<LINE>And so extenuate the &#8217;forehand sin.</LINE>
<LINE>No, Leonato,</LINE>
<LINE>I never tempted her with word too large,</LINE>
<LINE>But as a brother to his sister, show&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>Bashful sincerity and comely love.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HERO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And seem&#8217;d I ever otherwise to you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Out on thee seeming! I will write against it:</LINE>
<LINE>You seem to me as Dian in her orb,</LINE>
<LINE>As chaste as is the bud ere it be blown;</LINE>
<LINE>But you are more intemperate in your blood</LINE>
<LINE>Than Venus, or those pamp&#8217;red animals</LINE>
<LINE>That rage in savage sensuality.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HERO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is my lord well, that he doth speak so wide?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sweet Prince, why speak not you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>D. PEDRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">What should I speak?</LINE>
<LINE>I stand dishonor&#8217;d, that have gone about</LINE>
<LINE>To link my dear friend to a common stale.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Are these things spoken, or do I but dream?</LINE>

<SPEAKER>D. JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, they are spoken, and these things are true.</LINE>

<LINE>Is this the Prince? Is this the Prince&#8217;s brother?</LINE>
<LINE>Is this face Hero&#8217;s? Are our eyes our own?</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>All this is so, but what of this, my lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let me but move one question to your daughter,</LINE>
<LINE>And by that fatherly and kindly power</LINE>
<LINE>That you have in her, bid her answer truly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>To make you answer truly to your name.</LINE>

<LINE>With any just reproach?</LINE>

<LINE>Hero itself can blot out Hero&#8217;s virtue.</LINE>
<LINE>What man was he talk&#8217;d with you yesternight</LINE>
<LINE>Out at your window betwixt twelve and one?</LINE>
<LINE>Now if you are a maid, answer to this.</LINE>

<LINE>I talk&#8217;d with no man at that hour, my lord.</LINE>

<LINE>Why then are you no maiden. Leonato,</LINE>
<LINE>I am sorry you must hear. Upon mine honor,</LINE>
<LINE>Myself, my brother, and this grieved count</LINE>
<LINE>Did see her, hear her, at that hour last night</LINE>
<LINE>Talk with a ruffian at her chamber-window,</LINE>
<LINE>Who hath indeed, most like a liberal villain,</LINE>
<LINE>Confess&#8217;d the vile encounters they have had</LINE>
<LINE>A thousand times in secret.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>D. JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fie, fie, they are not to be named, my lord,</LINE>
<LINE>Not to be spoke of;</LINE>
<LINE>There is not chastity enough in language</LINE>
<LINE>Without offense to utter them. Thus, pretty lady,</LINE>
<LINE>I am sorry for thy much misgovernment.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O Hero! What a Hero hadst thou been,</LINE>
<LINE>If half thy outward graces had been placed</LINE>
<LINE>About thy thoughts and counsels of thy heart!</LINE>
<LINE>But fare thee well, most foul, most fair! Farewell,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou pure impiety and impious purity!</LINE>
<LINE>For thee I&#8217;ll lock up all the gates of love,</LINE>
<LINE>And on my eyelids shall conjecture hang,</LINE>
<LINE>To turn all beauty into thoughts of harm,</LINE>
<LINE>And never shall it more be gracious.</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Wherefore? Why, doth not every earthly thing</LINE>
<LINE>Cry shame upon her? Could she here deny</LINE>
<LINE>The story that is printed in her blood?</LINE>
<LINE>Do not live, Hero, do not ope thine eyes;</LINE>
<LINE>For did I think thou wouldst not quickly die,</LINE>
<LINE>Thought I thy spirits were stronger than thy shames,</LINE>
<LINE>Myself would, on the rearward of reproaches,</LINE>
<LINE>Strike at thy life. Griev&#8217;d I, I had but one?</LINE>
<LINE>Chid I for that at frugal nature&#8217;s frame?</LINE>
<LINE>O, one too much by thee! Why had I one?</LINE>
<LINE>Why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes?</LINE>
<LINE>Why had I not with charitable hand</LINE>
<LINE>Took up a beggar&#8217;s issue at my gates,</LINE>
<LINE>Who smirched thus and mir&#8217;d with infamy,</LINE>
<LINE>I might have said, &#8220;No part of it is mine;</LINE>
<LINE>This shame derives itself from unknown loins&#8221;?</LINE>
<LINE>But mine, and mine I lov&#8217;d, and mine I prais&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>And mine that I was proud on, mine so much</LINE>
<LINE>That I myself was to myself not mine,</LINE>
<LINE>Valuing of her&#8212;why, she, O she is fall&#8217;n</LINE>
<LINE>Into a pit of ink, that the wide sea</LINE>
<LINE>Hath drops too few to wash her clean again,</LINE>
<LINE>And salt too little which may season give</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Lady, were you her bedfellow last night?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEAT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, truly, not, although until last night,</LINE>
<LINE>I have this twelvemonth been her bedfellow.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Confirm&#8217;d, confirm&#8217;d! O, that is stronger made</LINE>
<LINE>Which was before barr&#8217;d up with ribs of iron!</LINE>
<LINE>Would the two princes lie, and Claudio lie,</LINE>
<LINE>Who lov&#8217;d her so, that speaking of her foulness,</LINE>
<LINE>Wash&#8217;d it with tears? Hence from her, let her die.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hear me a little,</LINE>
<LINE>For I have only been silent so long,</LINE>
<LINE>And given way unto this course of fortune,</LINE>
<LINE>By noting of the lady. I have mark&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>A thousand blushing apparitions</LINE>
<LINE>To start into her face, a thousand innocent shames</LINE>
<LINE>In angel whiteness beat away those blushes,</LINE>
<LINE>And in her eye there hath appear&#8217;d a fire</LINE>
<LINE>To burn the errors that these princes hold</LINE>
<LINE>Against her maiden truth. Call me a fool,</LINE>
<LINE>Trust not my reading, nor my observations,</LINE>
<LINE>Which with experimental seal doth warrant</LINE>
<LINE>The tenure of my book; trust not my age,</LINE>
<LINE>My reverence, calling, nor divinity,</LINE>
<LINE>If this sweet lady lie not guiltless here</LINE>
<LINE>Under some biting error.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Friar, it cannot be.</LINE>
<LINE>Thou seest that all the grace that she hath left</LINE>
<LINE>Is that she will not add to her damnation</LINE>
<LINE>A sin of perjury; she not denies it.</LINE>
<LINE>Why seek&#8217;st thou then to cover with excuse</LINE>
<LINE>That which appears in proper nakedness?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Lady, what man is he you are accus&#8217;d of?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HERO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>They know that do accuse me, I know none.</LINE>
<LINE>If I know more of any man alive</LINE>
<LINE>Than that which maiden modesty doth warrant,</LINE>
<LINE>Let all my sins lack mercy! O my father,</LINE>
<LINE>Prove you that any man with me convers&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>At hours unmeet, or that I yesternight</LINE>
<LINE>Maintain&#8217;d the change of words with any creature,</LINE>
<LINE>Refuse me, hate me, torture me to death!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There is some strange misprision in the princes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Two of them have the very bent of honor,</LINE>
<LINE>And if their wisdoms be misled in this,</LINE>
<LINE>The practice of it lives in John the Bastard,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose spirits toil in frame of villainies.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know not. If they speak but truth of her,</LINE>
<LINE>These hands shall tear her; if they wrong her honor,</LINE>
<LINE>The proudest of them shall well hear of it.</LINE>
<LINE>Time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor age so eat up my invention,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor fortune made such havoc of my means,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor my bad life reft me so much of friends,</LINE>
<LINE>But they shall find, awak&#8217;d in such a kind,</LINE>
<LINE>Both strength of limb, and policy of mind,</LINE>
<LINE>Ability in means, and choice of friends,</LINE>
<LINE>To quit me of them throughly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">Pause awhile,</LINE>
<LINE>And let my counsel sway you in this case.</LINE>
<LINE>Your daughter here the princes left for dead,</LINE>
<LINE>Let her awhile be secretly kept in,</LINE>
<LINE>And publish it that she is dead indeed.</LINE>
<LINE>Maintain a mourning ostentation,</LINE>
<LINE>And on your family&#8217;s old monument</LINE>
<LINE>Hang mournful epitaphs, and do all rites</LINE>
<LINE>That appertain unto a burial.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What shall become of this? What will this do?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, this well carried shall on her behalf</LINE>
<LINE>Change slander to remorse; that is some good.</LINE>
<LINE>But not for that dream I on this strange course,</LINE>
<LINE>But on this travail look for greater birth:</LINE>
<LINE>She dying, as it must be so maintain&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Upon the instant that she was accus&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Shall be lamented, pitied, and excus&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>Of every hearer; for it so falls out</LINE>
<LINE>That what we have we prize not to the worth</LINE>
<LINE>Whiles we enjoy it, but being lack&#8217;d and lost,</LINE>
<LINE>Why then we rack the value; then we find</LINE>
<LINE>The virtue that possession would not show us</LINE>
<LINE>Whiles it was ours. So will it fare with Claudio:</LINE>
<LINE>When he shall hear she died upon his words,</LINE>
<LINE>Th&#8217; idea of her life shall sweetly creep</LINE>
<LINE>Into his study of imagination,</LINE>
<LINE>And every lovely organ of her life</LINE>
<LINE>Shall come apparell&#8217;d in more precious habit,</LINE>
<LINE>More moving, delicate, and full of life,</LINE>
<LINE>Into the eye and prospect of his soul,</LINE>
<LINE>Than when she liv&#8217;d indeed. Then shall he mourn,</LINE>
<LINE>If ever love had interest in his liver,</LINE>
<LINE>And wish he had not so accused her;</LINE>
<LINE>No, though he thought his accusation true.</LINE>
<LINE>Let this be so, and doubt not but success</LINE>
<LINE>Will fashion the event in better shape</LINE>
<LINE>Than I can lay it down in likelihood.</LINE>
<LINE>But if all aim but this be levell&#8217;d false,</LINE>
<LINE>The supposition of the lady&#8217;s death</LINE>
<LINE>Will quench the wonder of her infamy.</LINE>
<LINE>And if it sort not well, you may conceal her,</LINE>
<LINE>As best befits her wounded reputation,</LINE>
<LINE>In some reclusive and religious life,</LINE>
<LINE>Out of all eyes, tongues, minds, and injuries.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Signior Leonato, let the friar advise you,</LINE>
<LINE>And though you know my inwardness and love</LINE>
<LINE>Is very much unto the Prince and Claudio,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet, by mine honor, I will deal in this</LINE>
<LINE>As secretly and justly as your soul</LINE>
<LINE>Should with your body.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Being that I flow in grief,</LINE>
<LINE>The smallest twine may lead me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis well consented; presently away,</LINE>
<LINE>For to strange sores strangely they strain the cure.</LINE>
<LINE>Come, lady, die to live; this wedding-day</LINE>
<LINE>Perhaps is but prolong&#8217;d, have patience and endure.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit with all but Benedick and Beatrice.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Lady Beatrice, have you wept all this while?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEAT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yea, and I will weep a while longer.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will not desire that.</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>I do love nothing in the world so well as you&#8212;is not that strange?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEAT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As strange as the thing I know not. It were as possible for me to say I lov&#8217;d nothing so well as you, but believe me not; and yet I lie not: I confess nothing, nor I deny nothing. I am sorry for my cousin.</LINE>

<LINE>Is Claudio thine enemy?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEAT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is &#8217;a not approv&#8217;d in the height a villain, that hath slander&#8217;d, scorn&#8217;d, dishonor&#8217;d my kinswoman? O that I were a man! What, bear her in hand until they come to take hands, and then with public accusation, uncover&#8217;d slander, unmitigated rancor&#8212;O God, that I were a man! I would eat his heart in the market-place.</LINE>

<LINE>Beat&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEAT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Princes and counties! Surely a princely testimony, a goodly count, Count Comfect, a sweet gallant surely! O that I were a man for his sake! Or that I had any friend would be a man for my sake! But manhood is melted into cur&#8217;sies, valor into compliment, and men are only turn&#8217;d into tongue, and trim ones too. He is now as valiant as Hercules that only tells a lie, and swears it. I cannot be a man with wishing, therefore I will die a woman with grieving.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tarry, good Beatrice. By this hand, I love thee.</LINE>

<LINE>Enough, I am engag&#8217;d, I will challenge him. I will kiss your hand, and so I leave you. By this hand, Claudio shall render me a dear account. As you hear of me, so think of me. Go comfort your cousin. I must say she is dead; and so farewell.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="3">I pray thee cease thy counsel,</LINE>
<LINE>Which falls into mine ears as profitless</LINE>
<LINE>As water in a sieve. Give not me counsel,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor let no comforter delight mine ear</LINE>
<LINE>But such a one whose wrongs do suit with mine.</LINE>
<LINE>Bring me a father that so lov&#8217;d his child,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose joy of her is overwhelm&#8217;d like mine,</LINE>
<LINE>And bid him speak of patience;</LINE>
<LINE>Measure his woe the length and breadth of mine,</LINE>
<LINE>And let it answer every strain for strain,</LINE>
<LINE>As thus for thus, and such a grief for such,</LINE>
<LINE>In every lineament, branch, shape, and form;</LINE>
<LINE>If such a one will smile and stroke his beard,</LINE>

<LINE>But there is no such man, for, brother, men</LINE>
<LINE>Can counsel and speak comfort to that grief</LINE>
<LINE>Which they themselves not feel, but tasting it,</LINE>
<LINE>Their counsel turns to passion, which before</LINE>

<LINE>No, no, &#8217;tis all men&#8217;s office to speak patience</LINE>
<LINE>To those that wring under the load of sorrow,</LINE>
<LINE>But no man&#8217;s virtue nor sufficiency</LINE>

<LINE>I&#8217; faith, I thank him, he hath bid me to a calve&#8217;s-head and a capon, the which if I do not carve most curiously, say my knife&#8217;s naught. Shall I not find a woodcock too?</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, your wit ambles well, it goes easily.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>D. PEDRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll tell thee how Beatrice prais&#8217;d thy wit the other day. I said thou hadst a fine wit. &#8220;True,&#8221; said she, &#8220;a fine little one.&#8221; &#8220;No,&#8221; said I, &#8220;a great wit.&#8221; &#8220;Right,&#8221; says she, &#8220;a great gross one.&#8221; &#8220;Nay,&#8221; said I, &#8220;a good wit.&#8221; &#8220;Just,&#8221; said she, &#8220;it hurts nobody.&#8221; &#8220;Nay,&#8221; said I, &#8220;the gentleman is wise.&#8221; &#8220;Certain,&#8221; said she, &#8220;a wise gentleman.&#8221; &#8220;Nay,&#8221; said I, &#8220;he hath the tongues.&#8221; &#8220;That I believe,&#8221; said she, &#8220;for he swore a thing to me on Monday night, which he forswore on Tuesday morning. There&#8217;s a double tongue, there&#8217;s two tongues.&#8221; Thus did she an hour together trans-shape thy particular virtues, yet at last she concluded with a sigh, thou wast the proper&#8217;st man in Italy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For the which she wept heartily and said she car&#8217;d not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>D. PEDRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yea, that she did, but yet for all that, and if she did not hate him deadly, she would love him dearly. The old man&#8217;s daughter told us all.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>All, all, and, moreover, God saw him when he was hid in the garden.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>D. PEDRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But when shall we set the savage bull&#8217;s horns on the sensible Benedick&#8217;s head?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yea, and text underneath, &#8220;Here dwells Benedick the married man&#8221;?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fare you well, boy, you know my mind. I will leave you now to your gossip-like humor. You break jests as braggards do their blades, which, God be thank&#8217;d, hurt not. My lord, for your many courtesies I thank you. I must discontinue your company. Your brother the bastard is fled from Messina. You have among you kill&#8217;d a sweet and innocent lady. For my Lord Lack-beard there, he and I shall meet, and till then peace be with him.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>D. PEDRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Officers, what offense have these men done?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOG.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, sir, they have committed false report; moreover they have spoken untruths; secondarily, they are slanders; sixt and lastly, they have belied a lady; thirdly, they have verified unjust things; and to conclude, they are lying knaves.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>D. PEDRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>First, I ask thee what they have done; thirdly, I ask thee what&#8217;s their offense; sixt and lastly, why they are committed; and to conclude, what you lay to their charge.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>Who have you offended, masters, that you are thus bound to your answer? This learned constable is too cunning to be understood. What&#8217;s your offense?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BORA.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sweet Prince, let me go no farther to mine answer: do you hear me, and let this count kill me. I have deceiv&#8217;d even your very eyes. What your wisdoms could not discover, these shallow fools have brought to light, who in the night overheard me confessing to this man how Don John your brother incens&#8217;d me to slander the Lady Hero, how you were brought into the orchard, and saw me court Margaret in Hero&#8217;s garments, how you disgrac&#8217;d her when you should marry her. My villainy they have upon record, which I had rather seal with my death than repeat over to my shame. The lady is dead upon mine and my master&#8217;s false accusation; and briefly, I desire nothing but the reward of a villain.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>No, not so, villain, thou beliest thyself.</LINE>
<LINE>Here stand a pair of honorable men,</LINE>
<LINE>A third is fled, that had a hand in it.</LINE>
<LINE>I thank you, princes, for my daughter&#8217;s death;</LINE>
<LINE>Record it with your high and worthy deeds.</LINE>

<LINE>I know not how to pray your patience,</LINE>

<LINE>How innocent she died, and if your love</LINE>
<LINE>Can labor aught in sad invention,</LINE>
<LINE>Hang her an epitaph upon her tomb,</LINE>
<LINE>And sing it to her bones, sing it tonight.</LINE>
<LINE>Tomorrow morning come you to my house,</LINE>
<LINE>And since you could not be my son-in-law,</LINE>
<LINE>Be yet my nephew. My brother hath a daughter,</LINE>
<LINE>Almost the copy of my child that&#8217;s dead,</LINE>
<LINE>And she alone is heir to both of us.</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Moreover, sir, which indeed is not under white and black, this plaintiff here, the offender, did call me ass. I beseech you let it be rememb&#8217;red in his punishment. And also, the watch heard them talk of one Deformed. They say he wears a key in his ear and a lock hanging by it, and borrows money in God&#8217;s name, the which he hath us&#8217;d so long and never paid that now men grow hard-hearted and will lend nothing for God&#8217;s sake. Pray you examine him upon that point.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>BENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou hast frighted the word out of his right sense, so forcible is thy wit.

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEAT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For them all together, which maintain&#8217;d so politic a state of evil that they will not admit any good part to intermingle with them. But for which of my good parts did you first suffer love for me?</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Suffer love! A good epithite! I do suffer love indeed, for I love thee against my will.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>An old, an old instance, Beatrice, that liv&#8217;d in the time of good neighbors. If a man do not erect in this age his own tomb ere he dies, he shall live no longer in monument than the bell rings and the widowweeps.</LINE>

<LINE>And how long is that, think you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Question: why, an hour in clamor and a quarter in rheum; therefore is it most expedient for the wise, if Don Worm (his conscience) find no impediment to the contrary, to be the trumpet of his own virtues, as I am to myself.

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>D. PEDRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good morrow, masters, put your torches out.</LINE>
<LINE>The wolves have preyed, and look, the gentle day,</LINE>
<LINE>Before the wheels of Phoebus, round about</LINE>
<LINE>Dapples the drowsy east with spots of grey.</LINE>
<LINE>Thanks to you all, and leave us. Fare you well.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUD.</SPEAKER>

<SPEAKER>D. PEDRO.</SPEAKER>

<LINE>And then to Leonato&#8217;s we will go.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And Hymen now with luckier issue speed&#8217;s</LINE>
<LINE>Than this for whom we rend&#8217;red up this woe.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Did I not tell you she was innocent?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So are the Prince and Claudio, who accus&#8217;d her</LINE>
<LINE>Upon the error that you heard debated.</LINE>
<LINE>But Margaret was in some fault for this,</LINE>
<LINE>Although against her will, as it appears</LINE>
<LINE>In the true course of all the question.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, I am glad that all things sorts so well.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And so am I, being else by faith enforc&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>To call young Claudio to a reckoning for it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, daughter, and you gentlewomen all,</LINE>
<LINE>Withdraw into a chamber by yourselves,</LINE>
<LINE>And when I send for you, come hither masked.</LINE>
<LINE>The Prince and Claudio promis&#8217;d by this hour</LINE>
<LINE>To visit me. You know your office, brother:</LINE>
<LINE>You must be father to your brother&#8217;s daughter,</LINE>
<LINE>And give her to young Claudio.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt Ladies.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Which I will do with confirm&#8217;d countenance.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Friar, I must entreat your pains, I think.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To do what, signior?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To bind me, or undo me&#8212;one of them.</LINE>
<LINE>Signior Leonato, truth it is, good signior,</LINE>
<LINE>Your niece regards me with an eye of favor.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That eye my daughter lent her, &#8217;tis most true.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And I do with an eye of love requite her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The sight whereof I think you had from me,</LINE>
<LINE>From Claudio, and the Prince. But what&#8217;s your will?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your answer, sir, is enigmatical,</LINE>
<LINE>But for my will, my will is your good will</LINE>
<LINE>May stand with ours, this day to be conjoin&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>In the state of honorable marriage,</LINE>
<LINE>In which, good friar, I shall desire your help.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My heart is with your liking.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">And my help.</LINE>
<LINE>Here comes the Prince and Claudio.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Prince Don Pedro and Claudio and two or three other.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>D. PEDRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good morrow to this fair assembly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good morrow, Prince; good morrow, Claudio;</LINE>
<LINE>We here attend you. Are you yet determined</LINE>
<LINE>Today to marry with my brother&#8217;s daughter?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll hold my mind were she an Ethiope.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Call her forth, brother, here&#8217;s the friar ready.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit Antonio.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>D. PEDRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good morrow, Benedick. Why, what&#8217;s the matter,</LINE>
<LINE>That you have such a February face,</LINE>
<LINE>So full of frost, of storm, and cloudiness?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I think he thinks upon the savage bull.</LINE>
<LINE>Tush, fear not, man, we&#8217;ll tip thy horns with gold,</LINE>
<LINE>And all Europa shall rejoice at thee,</LINE>
<LINE>As once Europa did at lusty Jove,</LINE>
<LINE>When he would play the noble beast in love.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Bull Jove, sir, had an amiable low,</LINE>
<LINE>And some such strange bull leapt your father&#8217;s cow,</LINE>
<LINE>And got a calf in that same noble feat</LINE>
<LINE>Much like to you, for you have just his bleat.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Brother Antonio, Hero, Beatrice, Margaret, Ursula, the ladies masked.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For this I owe you: here comes other reck&#8217;nings.</LINE>
<LINE>Which is the lady I must seize upon?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This same is she, and I do give you her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why then she&#8217;s mine. Sweet, let me see your face.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, that you shall not till you take her hand,</LINE>
<LINE>Before this friar, and swear to marry her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Give me your hand before this holy friar&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>I am your husband if you like of me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HERO.</SPEAKER>
<STAGEDIR>Unmasking.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>And when I liv&#8217;d, I was your other wife,</LINE>
<LINE>And when you lov&#8217;d, you were my other husband.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Another Hero!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HERO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="3">Nothing certainer:</LINE>
<LINE>One Hero died defil&#8217;d, but I do live,</LINE>
<LINE>And surely as I live, I am a maid.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>D. PEDRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The former Hero! Hero that is dead!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She died, my lord, but whiles her slander liv&#8217;d.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRIAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>All this amazement can I qualify,</LINE>
<LINE>When after that the holy rites are ended,</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll tell you largely of fair Hero&#8217;s death.</LINE>
<LINE>Mean time let wonder seem familiar,</LINE>
<LINE>And to the chapel let us presently.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Soft and fair, friar. Which is Beatrice?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEAT.</SPEAKER>
<STAGEDIR>Unmasking.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>I answer to that name. What is your will?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do not you love me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEAT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Why, no, no more than reason.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why then your uncle and the Prince and Claudio</LINE>
<LINE>Have been deceived. They swore you did.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEAT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do not you love me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Troth, no, no more than reason.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEAT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why then my cousin, Margaret, and Ursula</LINE>
<LINE>Are much deceiv&#8217;d, for they did swear you did.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>They swore that you were almost sick for me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEAT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>They swore that you were well-nigh dead for me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis no such matter. Then you do not love me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEAT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, truly, but in friendly recompense.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, cousin, I am sure you love the gentleman.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And I&#8217;ll be sworn upon&#8217;t that he loves her,</LINE>
<LINE>For here&#8217;s a paper written in his hand,</LINE>
<LINE>A halting sonnet of his own pure brain,</LINE>
<LINE>Fashion&#8217;d to Beatrice.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HERO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">And here&#8217;s another</LINE>
<LINE>Writ in my cousin&#8217;s hand, stol&#8217;n from her pocket,</LINE>
<LINE>Containing her affection unto Benedick.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A miracle! Here&#8217;s our own hands against our hearts. Come, I will have thee, but by this light, I take thee for pity.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEAT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would not deny you, but by this good day, I yield upon great persuasion, and partly to save your life, for I was told you were in a consumption.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Peace, I will stop your mouth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Kissing her.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>D. PEDRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How dost thou, Benedick the married man?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll tell thee what, Prince: a college of wit-crackers cannot flout me out of my humor. Dost thou think I care for a satire or an epigram? No, if a man will be beaten with brains, &#8217;a shall wear nothing handsome about him. In brief, since I do purpose to marry, I will think nothing to any purpose that the world can say against it, and therefore never flout at me for what I have said against it; for man is a giddy thing, and this is my conclusion. For thy part, Claudio, I did think to have beaten thee, but in that thou art like to be my kinsman, live unbruis&#8217;d, and love my cousin.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I had well hop&#8217;d thou wouldst have denied Beatrice, that I might have cudgell&#8217;d thee out of thy single life, to make thee a double-dealer, which out of question thou wilt be, if my cousin do not look exceeding narrowly to thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, come, we are friends. Let&#8217;s have a dance ere we are married, that we may lighten our own hearts and our wives&#8217; heels.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We&#8217;ll have dancing afterward.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>First, of my word; therefore play, music. Prince, thou art sad, get thee a wife, get thee a wife. There is no staff more reverent than one tipp&#8217;d with horn.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Messenger.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MESS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, your brother John is ta&#8217;en in flight,</LINE>
<LINE>And brought with armed men back to Messina.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Think not on him till tomorrow. I&#8217;ll devise thee brave punishments for him. Strike up, pipers.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Dance. Exeunt.</STAGEDIR>
