<persona gender="male">
<persname short="D. PEDRO.">Don Pedro</persname>
<persdescription>Don Pedro is the Prince of Aragon. He has just won a war against his illegitimate half-brother Don John. He reconciles himself to his brother, though he doesn&#8217;t speak to him much and may merely be keeping him close to keep an eye on him. Though a bachelor himself, he has a high enough regard for marriage to help Claudio in asking for Hero&#8217;s hand and to join in mocking Benedick for his insistence on never marrying. Willing and able to trade barbs with Beatrice at her own level, he soon decides she would be well-matched with Benedick, and entirely hatches the plot to bring them together. Despite all his reasons to distrust his half-brother, he believes Don John&#8217;s accusations readily enough to agree to spy on Hero&#8217;s window, and swears that if the allegations are true he will join Claudio in disgracing the lady in church to repair his own honor, which is tarnished by having arranged the match. His conviction of his rectitude after the scene in the church is such that he will not offer any hint of apology for his behavior to Leonato, and is able to quickly switch tacks and return to mocking Benedick. Though horrified when it turns out he has been gulled and willing to mourn Hero, he still refuses admit that there was anything wrong with his behavior per se, merely that he acted on faulty information.</persdescription>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="D. JOHN.">Don John</persname>
<persdescription>Don John is a bastard, in both the legal and ethical senses of the term. The essence of his character is that he is evil. Having recently rebelled against his half-brother Don Pedro and lost, he is forced to follow the winners to Leonato&#8217;s. He does not admit having been in any way wrong. His general disposition is melancholy, that is, depressed and depressing. He believes that the more depressed he appears, the happier his brother&#8217;s followers are. However, he fully intends to work any mischief he can, and as Claudio was one of the chief instruments of Don John&#8217;s defeat, the thought of ruining his life is particularly pleasing. While his first attempt to spark jealousy in Claudio is only momentarily successful, his follower Borachio&#8217;s plan works marvellously&#8213;so well that Don John pays him a thousand ducats in recompense. Having accomplished his desired evil ends&#8213;Hero dead, Claudio distraught, Don Pedro shamed, Leonato dishonored&#8213;Don John flees, but is caught. It seems that Benedick will arrange his punishment, a thought likely to strike fear in him.</persdescription>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="CLAUD.">Claudio</persname>
<persdescription>Claudio is a Count of Don Pedro&#8217;s suite, who has distinguished himself in the recent war. He is from Florence, though he has an emotional uncle living in Messina. Young, still beardless, and built enough like the Prince that the latter can pass for him, Claudio is, to put it charitably, not very bright, as well as easily deceived and quick to jealousy. He is also, judging by the verses he will read at Hero&#8217;s tomb, an absolutely dreadful poet. Still, he is quick enough of wit to join in with Don Pedro&#8217;s mockery of Benedick. He is the latter&#8217;s boon companion of the moment. He is insecure, willing to believe the least suggestion that he is bring betrayed and always overreacting to that belief, particularly when he chooses to publicly disgrace Hero in church when he believes her unfaithful, rather than simply calling the wedding off in the morning. He refuses to fight either of the two old brothers who challenge him, but must accept to match with Benedick. As soon as he hears that he was deceived, he swears that he is once again as in love with Hero as he was before, and accepts any penance Leonato wishes to place on him. Steadied to marry Leonato&#8217;s niece, no matter how ugly, he is shocked to discover that she is actually Hero, who isn&#8217;t dead after all and is for some reason still willing to marry him.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="BENE.">Benedick</persname>
<persdescription>Benedick is a gentleman of Padua serving in Don Pedro&#8217;s army. He wears a beard at the beginning of the play. According to Beatrice, he adopts a new best friend once a month, possibly out of a concern for money; his present one is Claudio. Benedick is best known for his apparent distaste for women, despite Beatrice&#8217;s status as his favorite verbal sparring partner, and his insistence that he will never marry. When Claudio falls in love with Hero, Benedick is disgusted that yet another bachelor is going to abandon that happy state. It is known that he and Beatrice share a history. He appears to have no taste for music that is not military. When he overhears the conversation designed to make him fall for Beatrice, he realizes that there is nothing he can actually hold against her, and determines to marry her, soon finding double meanings in her unfriendly words to him. He shaves his beard off and becomes melancholy, or at least affects to, as this is how lovers are prescribed to be. He chooses to remain with Beatrice and her family rather than leave after the fracas at the church, and is quick to suspect Don John&#8217;s hand in it. Tested between his love for Beatrice and for his friend, he chooses the former and agrees to fight Claudio to the death. He refuses to be drawn into battles of wit with either Claudio or the Prince, but regains enough of his sense of humor to flirt shamelessly with Margaret and extravagantly compliment her when asking for her help with Beatrice. Unlike Claudio, he realizes that he is a terrible poet, and gives up on attempts to write a sonnet. He does however discover that kissing Beatrice is one way to make her be quiet, come over to the side of dancing music, and begin to mock the Prince for being a bachelor. Upon Don John&#8217;s capture at the end of the play, he promises to think up a punishment for him.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="LEON.">Leonato</persname>
<persdescription>Leonato, the governor of Messina, is an older man, with a white beard. He has a daughter, Hero, and is the guardian of an orphaned niece, Beatrice. He indulges the latter in her flights of wit, and appears to greatly enjoy them. A good subject, he is delighted but cautious at the thought of his daughter marrying the prince when his brother Antonio reports that Don Pedro may woo her. He is just as happy to marry her off to Claudio at the prince&#8217;s request, and joins in with Don Pedro&#8217;s plot to bring Beatrice and Benedick together. When his daughter is accused of being a harlot at her wedding, his instinct is to believe the charges because they were made by the prince. His rage at her is however transferred to Don Pedro and Claudio when he is convinced of Hero&#8217;s innocence. He does however attempt to calm down his brother when the latter lashes out at the two young men who will not fight with them because of their advanced age. When it is discovered that the accusation was merely a well-planned slander, he decides to let the original planned marriage go ahead, but to make Don Pedro and Claudio suffer a little first, speaking to them with no little sarcasm and imposing the penance of telling the world of Hero&#8217;s innocence. He is friendly if impatient with his social inferiors such as Dogberry, but this may only be because this long-winded fellow comes to speak to him on the morning of his daughter&#8217;s wedding.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="ANT.">Antonio</persname>
<persdescription>Antonio is Leonato&#8217;s brother. An old man, he has a tendency to wag his head in a characteristic way. He apparently has a son who provides for the music in Leonato&#8217;s house. When a servant tells him that Don Pedro intends to woo Hero, he rushes to tell his brother, who is slightly skeptical of the thought. After the disaster in the church, he begins by playing the level-headed part, attempting to calm Leonato down, but when they are confronted by the prince and Claudio, he is incapable of restraining himself and loses his temper, insulting both Claudio and Don Pedro so severely than Leonato must attempt to calm him down in return. He has a very traditional view of the family that does not seem quite sure of how to deal with Beatrice, rarely addressing her.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="BALTH.">Balthasar</persname>
<persdescription>Balthasar is an attendant of Don Pedro&#8217;s and a musician. A singer, he most likely plays the lute to accompany himself. He is self-deprecating about his talent, and Benedick agrees with that self-assessment. He also talks too much, and is a bad dancer&#8213;his lack of ability in that direction ruins his chances with Margaret.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="CON.">Conrade</persname>
<persaliases>
	<persname short="BOTH CON. AND BORA.">Both Conrade and Borachio</persname>
</persaliases>
<persdescription>Conrade is one of Don John&#8217;s followers. He attempts to cheer Don John up and to convince him that he should be, at the least, happy that Don Pedro has taken him back, and use that favor to pursue his own ends. Don John has little ear, for this, however, and Conrade soon appears to be left out of the plot that Don John and Borachio put together. He comes across Borachio the night before Hero&#8217;s wedding. The latter is completely drunk and tells the tale of the deception he has just practiced, which Conrade finds most entertaining. He is then arrested. Brought before the sexton, he denies being a villain, and tells Dogberry to his face that he is an ass, provoking a remarkable tirade from the constable. He is brought with Borachio before Don Pedro and the others, but says nothing. He is apparently a Capricorn&#8213;at least, his ruling star is Saturn&#8213;but Don John does not find him as depressed as he should be for that star sign.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="BORA.">Borachio</persname>
<persaliases>
	<persname short="BOTH CON. AND BORA.">Both Conrade and Borachio</persname>
</persaliases>
<persdescription>Borachio is one of Don John&#8217;s followers. His name tells us well enough that he is a drunkard. He also has, however, a crafty mind. He knows to bring any news that might serve as the basis for mischief to Don John. He is having a fling with Margaret, and has no qualms about using her as a prop in his plot for Don John without her knowledge. The fact that he is able to get as far as he does with the confirmed flirt Margaret suggests that he is a good dancer, as that appears to be a requirement for her favor. Unfortunately, Borachio does not know to hold his tongue when drunk, which leads to his and Conrad&#8217;s arrest and the discovery of the whole plot. The news of Hero&#8217;s death appears to bring out some remorse in him, and confesses in full to Don Pedro. He is also honest enough to spontaneously clear Margaret of all blame when it appears she&#8217;s about to be dragged into the mess.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="FRIAR.">Friar Francis</persname>
<persdescription>Friar Francis is in the tradition of Romeo and Juliet&#8217;s Friar Laurence; both are long-winded, well-meaning, somewhat interfering gentlemen who think it is a fine idea to make people believe a young girl is dead. He is convinced of Hero&#8217;s innocence by her countenance at the wedding and shock at the accusations. He proposes that they should say that she died, thereby hopefully making Don Pedro and Claudio remorseful, rekindling Claudio&#8217;s love, and allowing for time to discover what&#8217;s actually going on. He is in charge of marrying everyone at the end.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="female">
<persname short="HERO.">Hero</persname>
<persdescription>Hero is Leonato&#8217;s daughter. A sweet and obedient girl overshadowed by her cousin Beatrice, she almost never speaks in her elders&#8217; presence. On her own with Ursula, however, she is quite capable of speech, particularly when she knows that Beatrice is overhearing her, and that therefore the plot to make her cousin and Benedick fall in love is advancing apace. She takes her father&#8217;s instructions to receive a suit from the Prince well, and offers no objection when the suit is for Claudio instead; during her talk in the garden, she claims to be fully in love with Claudio. When he suddenly turns on her on their wedding day, accusing her of being a harlot, she is shocked to the core and can summon no defense against the unexpected and false charges leveled at her. The blow is such that she faints. Reviving, she is able to say only that she has no idea what evidence there is against her. She accepts to go into seclusion until things are worked out. When the mystery is unraveled, she accepts to marry Claudio all the same, though no explanation why is given. She is quickly able to tease Beatrice and reveal that she has written a sonnet admitting to loving Benedick, essentially the first and only spontaneous action we see from her. She is a short woman, and (if one can trust Benedick&#8217;s opinion) dark of skin.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="female">
<persname short="BEAT.">Beatrice</persname>
<persdescription>Beatrice is Leonato&#8217;s orphaned niece. She appears to be somewhat taller than Hero, as well as older. She has a ready with which she clearly enjoys displaying, and is much given to mockery. Her favorite target is Benedick, with whom she has something of a history, to the extent that she exercises her talent for mocking him on the poor unsuspecting messenger and takes the first opportunity to needle him once he arrives. She has no care for a husband, and therefore little patience with the suggestion that her ready tongue will prevent her from gaining one. She has little care for social convention, and is quite capable of trading witticisms with the Prince as an equal. She is shocked to hear herself described as prideful by Hero and Ursula. She is shocked and enraged at the accusations thrown at her cousin, putting her in a vulnerable enough state that she will cry, almost admit to loving Benedick, and asking him to kill Claudio for her. When Benedick publically asks her if she loves him following the reconciliation of Claudio and Hero, Beatrice quickly returns to her habit of replying with witticisms, though it is quickly proved that she has recently written a not-very-adequate sonnet confessing to her love. Benedick is finally able to stop her flow of words by kissing her, as they agree to marry, though they insist this is not out of love.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="female">
<persname short="MARG.">Margaret</persname>
<persdescription>Margaret is Hero&#8217;s waiting-gentlewoman. A fashion-obsessed flirt who requires good dancing abilities in her men, she is witty enough to hold her own against both Benedick and Beatrice in certain circumstances. She joins in the plot to convince Beatrice that Benedick is in love with her, playing the important role of convincing her to go eavesdrop on Hero and Ursula. She has a fling with Borachio, which is serious enough that he can convince her to engage in a little role-playing and pretend to be Hero one night. She is unaware of the repercussions of this game until after Borachio&#8217;s arrest, when she is questioned by Leonato. She is one of the veiled ladies who mystify Claudio at the end.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="female">
<persname short="URS.">Ursula</persname>
<persdescription>Ursula is one of Hero&#8217;s waiting-gentlewomen. She recognizes the masked Antonio as they dance together at the ball and gleefully joins in the plot to make Beatrice and Benedick fall in love, praising Benedick extravagantly to Hero when she knows that Beatrice is eavesdropping.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="DOG.">Dogberry</persname>
<persdescription>Dogberry is the constable of the Watch, whose job is to patrol the streets of Messina at night and keep order. Dogberry has very few doubts about himself. Some of these are not entirely warranted: he is a determined word-mangler, whose attempts to use learned words go continually awry, a fact of which he is blissfully unaware. Since none of his underlings understand either the words he is using or those he is attempting to, this goes unremarked upon by the lesser sort. He is also very conscious of his place, and continually interrupts his second-in-command Verges when the letter attempts to speak. His instructions to the Watch seem somewhat contradictory to the whole purpose of patrolling. His inability to get to the point holds some responsibility for the scene in the church. By his own report, he is an officer, owns his own house, is rich enough that he has suffered investment losses, owns two gowns (which might be considered the equivalent of owning two very good suits), and thinks himself a fine specimen of a man. He is also old enough to call upon his years as worthy of respect.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="VERG.">Verges</persname>
<persdescription>Verges is the Headborough, and Dogberry&#8217;s partner as commander of the Watch. He is an old man, and seems to be completely under Dogberry&#8217;s thumb. Despite this, he does his best to actually accomplish the duties of the Watch, which he appears to understand much better than does his superior. He appears to show no resentment of Dogberry&#8217;s continual interruptions, and it is possible that he is somewhat weak in the head. He is apparently shorter than Dogberry.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="SEX.">Sexton</persname>
<persdescription>The Sexton is in charge of examining the men detained by the Watch, and it is his misfortune that the Watch should be commanded by Dogberry. The interrogation is soon taken over by Dogberry, but the Sexton is able to guide the matter in the correct direction. He has heard all the story of what happened in the church, as well as knowing of Don John&#8217;s flight, and is therefore convinced of the truth of the accusations. He resolves to let Leonato know of it at once.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="BOY.">Boy</persname>
<persdescription>A Boy attending on Benedick is none too bright. He fetches Benedick&#8217;s book at his request.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="MESS.">Messenger</persname>
<persdescription>The Messenger is sent by Don Pedro to announce his coming to Leonato. More than a mere letter-carrier, he knows enough to be able to fully answer all questions put to him, including the names of the best fighters and Benedick&#8217;s humor. He is not fully prepared for Beatrice&#8217;s wit or the tenor of her comments on Benedick. He comes to tell Leonato that they are ready for him at the church and later reports to Don Pedro that Don John has been caught.</persdescription>

<persname short="1. WATCH.">First Watchman</persname>
<persaliases>
	<persname short="BOTH 1. WATCH. AND 2. WATCH.">Both First and Second Watchmen</persname>
</persaliases>
<persdescription>The First Watchman suggests either Seacoal or Hugh Oatcake as leaders of the patrol, on the basis of their ability to read and write. He joins in the testimony to the Sexton.</persdescription>

<persname short="2. WATCH.">Second Watchman</persname>
<persaliases>
	<persname short="BOTH 1. WATCH. AND 2. WATCH.">Both First and Second Watchmen</persname>
</persaliases>
<persdescription>The Second Watchman (George Seacoal) is a member of the Watch who is able to read and write, and is therefore put in charge of the nightly patrol. Along with the other members of the Watch, he asks and receives clarifications of their charge which allow him to decree that they should all sit in one spot by the church until two o&#8217;clock and then go home. Hearing Borachio&#8217;s tale, however, he leads the Watch to arrest them. He testifies on the matter to the Sexton.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="WATCH.">Watchmen</persname>
<persdescription>The Watchmen (one of whom is Hugh Oatcake) are part of the neighbourhood watch that Dogberry commands, charged with patrolling the streets of Messina at night. They are neither particlarly bright nor conscientious, but still arrest Conrade and Borachio and lead them to the Sexton.</persdescription>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="A LORD.">Lord</persname>
<persdescription>A Lord is among Claudio&#8217;s and Don Pedro&#8217;s suite when they visit Hero&#8217;s tomb. As he can confirm that they have reached the right place, he is likely a native of Messina, and plausibly not one of Don Pedro&#8217;s own followers. He might even be a follower of Leonato&#8217;s sent as witness that Don Pedro and Claudio have kept their word.</persdescription>

<scenelocation>Messina. Before Leonato&#8217;s house.</scenelocation>
<scenepersonae>(Leonato, Hero, Beatrice, Messenger, Don Pedro, Claudio, Benedick, Balthasar, Don John the Bastard)</scenepersonae>
<scenedescription>Leonato, the governor of Messina, is informed that Don Pedro of Arragon and his troop will be arriving this evening, returning victorious from a battle in which they lost almost no-one, and in which Count Claudio greatly distinguished himself. Leonato&#8217;s niece Beatrice asks the messenger about Benedick, mocking him greatly. It turns out that Benedick&#8217;s best friend (this month) is Claudio.  Don Pedro and his train arrive, including Claudio and Benedick, along with Don John, Don Pedro&#8217;s half-brother who was fighting against him and lost the battle. Leonato invites them all to stay, and presents his daughter Hero to the prince. Benedick&#8217;s quick comments are answered by Beatrice, and the two engage in a battle of raillery that Benedick loses. The surly Don John accepts Leonato&#8217;s welcome after Don Pedro announces that they shall stay a month. Left alone, Claudio reveals to Benedick that he has been taken by Hero&#8217;s modesty and beauty. Benedick is appalled that yet another bachelor has been turned into a lover. Don Pedro returns for them and is informed of Claudio&#8217;s love, and when Benedick insists that he will remain a stranger to love all his life, the other two gang up on him and joyfully imagine how much they will mock him if he ever does fall in love. Claudio asks Don Pedro for help in wooing Hero, and Don Pedro offers to woo her for him in disguise at the masked ball that night, to see how she takes the proposal, and to take care of the details with Leonato.</scenedescription>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BEAT.</speaker>
<line form="prose">A dear happiness to women, they would else have been troubled with a pernicious suitor. I thank God and my cold blood, I am of your humor for that: I had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man swear he loves me.</line>

<speaker>BENE.</speaker>
<line form="prose">Why, i&#8217; faith, methinks she&#8217;s too low for a high praise, too brown for a fair praise, and too little for a great praise; only this commendation I can afford her, that were she other than she is, she were unhandsome, and being no other but as she is, I do not like her.</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BENE.</speaker>
<line form="prose">That I neither feel how she should be lov&#8217;d, nor know how she should be worthy, is the opinion that fire cannot melt out of me; I will die in it at the stake.</line>

<speaker>D. PEDRO.</speaker>

<line form="prose">That a woman conceiv&#8217;d me, I thank her; that she brought me up, I likewise give her most humble thanks; but that I will have a rechate winded in my forehead, or hang my bugle in an invisible baldrick, all women shall pardon me. Because I will not do them the wrong to mistrust any, I will do myself the right to trust none; and the fine is (for the which I may go the finer), I will live a bachelor.</line>

Prove that ever I lose more blood with love than I will get again with drinking, pick out mine eyes with a ballad-maker&#8217;s pen, and hang me up at the door of a brothel-house for the sign of blind Cupid.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>D. PEDRO.</speaker>

<line form="prose">The savage bull may, but if ever the sensible Benedick bear it, pluck off the bull&#8217;s horns, and set them in my forehead, and let me be vildly painted, and in such great letters as they write &#8220;Here is good horse to hire,&#8221; let them signify under my sign, &#8220;Here you may see Benedick the married man.&#8221;</line>

<scenelocation>A hall in Leonato&#8217;s house.</scenelocation>
<scenepersonae>(Leonato, Antonio, Hero, Beatrice, Margaret, Ursula, Kinsman, Prince Don Pedro, Claudio, Benedick, Don John, Borachio)</scenepersonae>
<scenedescription>As they wait for the guests to arrive at the masked ball, Leonato, Antonio, Hero and Beatrice discuss Don John and Benedick, Beatrice seizing the first opportunity to engage in yet more mocking of the latter, to the men&#8217;s amusement. Hero is reminded to say yes if Don Pedro asks her to marry him. Don Pedro&#8217;s masked party enters, and he quickly takes Hero aside, while Borachio attempts to dance with Margaret and Antonio tries to deny to Ursula that it is he behind the mask. Beatrice and Benedick, both masked, converse, and Beatrice badmouths him, knowing perfectly well who she&#8217;s speaking to, though he does not realize that she knows. Don John sidles up to Claudio, pretending to mistake him for Benedick, and tells him that Don Pedro is actually wooing Hero on his own account. Claudio is quite convinced and decides to have nothing more to do with Hero, and is surly when Benedick tries to joke with him, soon leaving him. Don Pedro comes looking for Claudio, but is distracted by chatting with Benedick and egging him on to discourse on Beatrice. Claudio, Leonato, Beatrice and Hero come in, and Don Pedro reveals that he has obtained Hero for the Count. Claudio is overjoyed. Beatrice rejects the idea of a husband for herself. After she leaves, the four left behind decide that for their own amusement and to occupy the time until Claudio and Hero&#8217;s wedding, they will try to make Beatrice and Benedick fall in love with each other.</scenedescription>

<speech>
<speaker>HERO.</speaker>
<line form="prose">He is of a very melancholy disposition.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BEAT.</speaker>
<line form="prose">He were an excellent man that were made just in the midway between him and Benedick: the one is too like an image and says nothing, and the other too like my lady&#8217;s eldest son, evermore tattling.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEON.</speaker>
<line form="prose">Then half Signior Benedick&#8217;s tongue in Count John&#8217;s mouth, and half Count John&#8217;s melancholy in Signior Benedick&#8217;s face&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BEAT.</speaker>
<line form="prose">With a good leg and a good foot, uncle, and money enough in his purse, such a man would win any woman in the world, if &#8217;a could get her good will.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>LEON.</speaker>
<line form="prose">By my troth, niece, thou wilt never get thee a husband, if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue.</line>

<speaker>ANT.</speaker>
<line form="prose">In faith, she&#8217;s too curst.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BEAT.</speaker>
<line form="prose">Too curst is more than curst. I shall lessen God&#8217;s sending that way, for it is said, &#8220;God sends a curst cow short horns&#8221;&#8212;but to a cow too curst he sends none.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEON.</speaker>
<line form="prose">So, by being too curst, God will send you no horns.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BEAT.</speaker>
<line form="prose">Just, if he send me no husband, for the which blessing I am at him upon my knees every morning and evening. Lord, I could not endure a husband with a beard on his face, I had rather lie in the woollen!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEON.</speaker>
<line form="prose">You may light on a husband that hath no beard.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BEAT.</speaker>
<line form="prose">What should I do with him? Dress him in my apparel and make him my waiting-gentlewoman? He that hath a beard is more than a youth, and he that hath no beard is less than a man; and he that is more than a youth is not for me, and he that is less than a man, I am not for him; therefore I will even take sixpence in earnest of the berrord, and lead his apes into hell.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEON.</speaker>
<line form="prose">Well then, go you into hell.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BEAT.</speaker>
<line form="prose">No, but to the gate, and there will the devil meet me like an old cuckold with horns on his head, and say, &#8220;Get you to heaven, Beatrice, get you to heaven, here&#8217;s no place for you maids.&#8221; So deliver I up my apes, and away to Saint Peter. For the heavens, he shows me where the bachelors sit, and there live we as merry as the day is long.</line>

<line form="prose">Well, niece, I trust you will be rul&#8217;d by your father.</line>

<line form="prose">Yes, faith, it is my cousin&#8217;s duty to make cur&#8217;sy and say, &#8220;Father, as it please you.&#8221; But yet for all that, cousin, let him be a handsome fellow, or else make another cur&#8217;sy and say, &#8220;Father, as it please me.&#8221;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEON.</speaker>
<line form="prose">Well, niece, I hope to see you one day fitted with a husband.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BEAT.</speaker>
<line form="prose">Not till God make men of some other mettle than earth. Would it not grieve a woman to be overmaster&#8217;d with a piece of valiant dust? To make an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl? No, uncle, I&#8217;ll none. Adam&#8217;s sons are my brethren, and truly I hold it a sin to match in my kinred.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEON.</speaker>
<line form="prose">Daughter, remember what I told you. If the Prince do solicit you in that kind, you know your answer.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BEAT.</speaker>
<line form="prose">The fault will be in the music, cousin, if you be not woo&#8217;d in good time. If the Prince be too important, tell him there is measure in every thing, and so dance out the answer. For hear me, Hero: wooing, wedding, and repenting, is as a Scotch jig, a measure, and a cinquepace; the first suit is hot and hasty, like a Scotch jig, and full as fantastical; the wedding, mannerly-modest, as a measure, full of state and ancientry; and then comes repentance, and with his bad legs falls into the cinquepace faster and faster, till he sink into his grave.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEON.</speaker>
<line form="prose">Cousin, you apprehend passing shrewdly.</line>

<line form="prose">Why, he is the Prince&#8217;s jester, a very dull fool; only his gift is in devising impossible slanders. None but libertines delight in him, and the commendation is not in his wit, but in his villainy, for he both pleases men and angers them, and then they laugh at him and beat him.

<line form="prose">Troth, my lord, I have play&#8217;d the part of Lady Fame. I found him here as melancholy as a lodge in a warren. I told him, and I think I told him true, that your Grace had got the good will of this young lady, and I off&#8217;red him my company to a willow-tree, either to make him a garland, as being forsaken, or to bind him up a rod, as being worthy to be whipt.</line>

<speaker>BENE.</speaker>
<line form="prose">O, she misus&#8217;d me past the endurance of a block; an oak but with one green leaf on it would have answer&#8217;d her. My very visor began to assume life, and scold with her. She told me, not thinking I had been myself, that I was the Prince&#8217;s jester, that I was duller than a great thaw, huddling jest upon jest with such impossible conveyance upon me that I stood like a man at a mark, with a whole army shooting at me. She speaks poniards, and every word stabs. If her breath were as terrible as her terminations, there were no living near her, she would infect to the north star. I would not marry her, though she were endow&#8217;d with all that Adam had left him before he transgress&#8217;d. She would have made Hercules have turn&#8217;d spit, yea, and have cleft his club to make the fire too. Come, talk not of her; you shall find her the infernal Ate in good apparel. I would to God some scholar would conjure her, for certainly, while she is here, a man may live as quiet in hell as in a sanctuary, and people sin upon purpose, because they would go thither; so indeed all disquiet, horror, and perturbation follows her.</line>

I will teach you how to humor your cousin, that she shall fall in love with Benedick, and I, with your two helps, will so practice on Benedick that, in despite of his quick wit and his queasy stomach, he shall fall in love with Beatrice. If we can do this, Cupid is no longer an archer; his glory shall be ours, for we are the only love-gods. Go in with me, and I will tell you my drift.</line>

<scenedescription>Benedick grouses to himself about how love makes men become foolish. Seeing Don Pedro and Claudio approaching, he hides in the bushes. The two see him do so, and put it to good use. Along with Leonato, they listen to a song sung by Balthazar, and then they loudly discuss how Beatrice is deeply in love with Benedick, though she refuses to show it. Benedick is rather taken aback, but is convinced this is not a prank because Leonato joins in. They discuss and dismiss the idea of telling Benedick, saying that he would only mock her to death if he knew. Once they are certain Benedick has taken the bait, they leave, planning to have Hero do much the same to Beatrice. Benedick reflects that after all, Beatrice is not such a bad party, and deciding that he is willing to put up with the mockery that will follow, determines to woo Beatrice. On this she enters, and shows absolutely no sign of being enamored, which Benedick manages to reinterpret as clearly showing her love.</scenedescription>

I have known when there was no music with him but the drum and the fife, and now had he rather hear the tabor and the pipe; I have known when he would have walk&#8217;d ten mile afoot to see a good armor, and now will he lie ten nights awake carving the fashion of a new doublet; he was wont to speak plain and to the purpose (like an honest man and a soldier), and now is he turn&#8217;d ortography&#8212;his words are a very fantastical banquet, just so many strange dishes. May I be so converted and see with these eyes? I cannot tell; I think not. I will not be sworn but love may transform me to an oyster, but I&#8217;ll take my oath on it, till he have made an oyster of me, he shall never make me such a fool. One woman is fair, yet I am well; another is wise, yet I am well; another virtuous, yet I am well; but till all graces be in one woman, one woman shall not come in my grace. 
Rich she shall be, that&#8217;s certain; wise, or I&#8217;ll none; virtuous, or I&#8217;ll never cheapen her; fair, or I&#8217;ll never look on her; mild, or come not near me; noble, or not I for an angel; of good discourse, an excellent musician, and her hair shall be of what color it please God.

<line form="prose">This can be no trick: the conference was sadly borne; they have the truth of this from Hero; they seem to pity the lady. It seems her affections have their full bent. Love me? Why, it must be requited. I hear how I am censur&#8217;d; they say I will bear myself proudly, if I perceive the love come from her; they say too that she will rather die than give any sign of affection. I did never think to marry. I must not seem proud; happy are they that hear their detractions, and can put them to mending. 
They say the lady is fair; &#8217;tis a truth, I can bear them witness; and virtuous; &#8217;tis so, I cannot reprove it; and wise, but for loving me; by my troth, it is no addition to her wit, nor no great argument of her folly, for I will be horribly in love with her. I may chance have some odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me, because I have rail&#8217;d so long against marriage; but doth not the appetite alter? A man loves the meat in his youth that he cannot endure in his age. 
Shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of the brain awe a man from the career of his humor? No, the world must be peopled. When I said I would die a bachelor, I did not think I should live till I were married. Here comes Beatrice. By this day, she&#8217;s a fair lady. I do spy some marks of love in her.</line>

<scenedescription>Dogberry and Verges, the captains of the Watch, organize their watchmen for the night, though Dogberry&#8217;s instructions leave rather a lot to be desired. Left to their own devices, the watchmen decide to sit on a bench until it&#8217;s time to go home. They overhear Borachio tell Conrade of the success of his plot, and how Claudio and Don Pedro are now convinced that Hero is unfaithful. Borachio has been well paid by Don John. The watchmen arrest the two for evil plotting.</scenedescription>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DOG.</speaker>
<line form="prose">Come hither, neighbor Seacole. God hath blest you with a good name. To be a well-favor&#8217;d man is the gift of fortune, but to write and read comes by nature.</line>

<line form="prose">Both which, Master Constable&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DOG.</speaker>
<line form="prose">You have: I knew it would be your answer. Well, for your favor, sir, why, give God thanks, and make no boast of it, and for your writing and reading, let that appear when there is no need of such vanity. You are thought here to be the most senseless and fit man for the constable of the watch; therefore bear you the lanthorn. This is your charge: you shall comprehend all vagrom men; you are to bid any man stand, in the Prince&#8217;s name.</line>
</speech>

<speaker>2. WATCH.</speaker>
<line form="prose">How if &#8217;a will not stand?</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DOG.</speaker>
<line form="prose">True, and they are to meddle with none but the Prince&#8217;s subjects. You shall also make no noise in the streets; for, for the watch to babble and to talk, is most tolerable, and not to be endur&#8217;d.</line>
</speech>

<speaker>2. WATCH.</speaker>
<line form="prose">We will rather sleep than talk, we know what belongs to a watch.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DOG.</speaker>
<line form="prose">Why, you speak like an ancient and most quiet watchman, for I cannot see how sleeping should offend; only have a care that your bills be not stol&#8217;n. Well, you are to call at all the alehouses, and bid those that are drunk get them to bed.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>DOG.</speaker>
<line form="prose">If you meet a thief, you may suspect him, by virtue of your office, to be no true man; and for such kind of men, the less you meddle or make with them, why, the more is for your honesty.</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DOG.</speaker>
<line form="prose">Truly by your office you may, but I think they that touch pitch will be defil&#8217;d. The most peaceable way for you, if you do take a thief, is to let him show himself what he is, and steal out of your company.</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DOG.</speaker>

<speaker>DOG.</speaker>
<line form="prose">Five shillings to one on&#8217;t, with any man that knows the statutes, he may stay him; marry, not without the Prince be willing, for indeed the watch ought to offend no man, and it is an offense to stay a man against his will.</line>

<scenelocation>Messina. Inside a church.</scenelocation>
<scenepersonae>(Prince Don Pedro, Don John the Bastard, Leonato, Friar Francis, Claudio, Benedick, Hero, Beatrice, Attendants)</scenepersonae>
<scenedescription>The gathered assembly meets before Friar Francis, who begins the marriage ceremony. Claudio asks Hero whether she knows any reason they should not be married, and she insists that she does not. Claudio then rejects her, accusing her of immorality; the confused Leonato attempts to defend her, and shocked Hero protests her innocence, but neither Claudio nor Don Pedro will have any of it, both swearing that they saw her the night before at her window, talking with Borachio. Claudio&#8217;s insults, supported by Don Pedro and Don John, are so severe that Hero faints. The three accusers leave Leonato and his friends alone, Benedick remaining behind as well. Beside himself with grief and thinking himself dishonored, Leonato bewails the day and wishes that Hero were dead. Benedick attempts to find some evidence to clear Hero, but Beatrice cannot help, as she did not sleep in Hero&#8217;s room as customary the previous night. Friar Francis, however, is convinced of Hero&#8217;s innocence. Restored, Hero still insists on her innocence, having no idea what she&#8217;s being accused of. Benedick suspects Don John of being at the root of all this trouble, but Leonato is too confused to have an opinion, swearing vengeance on anyone who may have caused this. The Friar suggests that they announce that Hero died of grief and hide her away, giving time to find out what has happened and making Claudio pity her, while offering a way to sneak her off to a nunnery if she turns out to be guilty. Leonato and the Friar lead Hero away. Benedick attempts to console the tearful Beatrice. They slowly admit to each other that they are in love, Benedick finally offering to do anything for her as proof – at which she tells him to kill Claudio. Benedick refuses, and Beatrice&#8217;s rage bursts forth, as she wishes she were a man so that she could fight Claudio herself. Despite his friendship for the Count, Benedick promises to challenge Claudio to a duel.</scenedescription>

<scenedescription>Antonio tries to comfort the grief-stricken Leonato, but with little effect. When they cross paths with Don Pedro and Claudio, however, Antonio soon reveals that he is not as calm as he seems. Both brothers rail at the Prince and the Count, challenging them to fight, but the younger men refuse to duel with old men. Neither of them shows any remorse for Hero&#8217;s death, insisting on the truth of their accusations. Leonato and Antonio leave in a rage, and Don Pedro and Claudio try to cheer themselves up by conversing with Benedick, who now arrives. They joke about the old men, but Benedick does not laugh, instead taking Claudio aside and challenging him. Don Pedro mocks him about Beatrice, but Benedick does not rise to the bait, rather resigning from his service to the Prince. Don Pedro and Claudio realize that he is serious. As he leaves, they joke that he is simply henpecked, but then Dogberry and the Watch arrives, and the two men discover that they were in the wrong. Realizing that this is why Don John has fled, Don Pedro is stricken with remorse, while Claudio feels deeply in love with Hero once again. Leonato enters to hear Borachio admit his villainy to his face, and confronts Don Pedro and Claudio, who offer to do anything he asks to be forgiven, though insisting their actions were only wrong because their information was false. Leonato orders them to sign an epitaph to Hero&#8217;s grave, and to marry Antonio&#8217;s daughter. Cllaudio agrees. Leonato wishes to confront Margaret over her part in the plot, but Borachio insists that she is innocent and did not know what he was up to.</scenedescription>

<line form="prose">I&#8217;ll tell thee how Beatrice prais&#8217;d thy wit the other day. 
I said thou hadst a fine wit.
 &#8220;True,&#8221; said she, &#8220;a fine little one.&#8221; &#8220;No,&#8221; said I, &#8220;a great wit.&#8221; &#8220;Right,&#8221; says she,
 &#8220;a great gross one.&#8221; &#8220;Nay,&#8221; said I, &#8220;a good wit.&#8221; &#8220;Just,&#8221; said she, &#8220;it hurts nobody.&#8221;
 &#8220;Nay,&#8221; said I, &#8220;the gentleman is wise.&#8221; &#8220;Certain,&#8221; said she, &#8220;a wise gentleman.&#8221; &#8220;Nay,&#8221; 
said I, &#8220;he hath the tongues.&#8221; &#8220;That I believe,&#8221; said she, &#8220;for he swore a thing to me on Monday night, which he forswore on Tuesday morning. 
There&#8217;s a double tongue, there&#8217;s two tongues.&#8221; 
Thus did she an hour together trans-shape thy particular virtues, yet at last she concluded with a sigh, thou wast the proper&#8217;st man in Italy.</line>

<speaker>CLAUD.</speaker>
<line form="prose">For the which she wept heartily and said she car&#8217;d not.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>D. PEDRO.</speaker>
<line form="prose">Yea, that she did, but yet for all that, and if she did not hate him deadly, she would love him dearly. The old man&#8217;s daughter told us all.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>BENE.</speaker>
<line form="prose">Fare you well, boy, you know my mind. I will leave you now to your gossip-like humor. You break jests as braggards do their blades, which, God be thank&#8217;d, hurt not. My lord, for your many courtesies I thank you. I must discontinue your company. Your brother the bastard is fled from Messina. You have among you kill&#8217;d a sweet and innocent lady.

What your wisdoms could not discover, these shallow fools have brought to light, who in the night overheard me confessing to this man how Don John your brother incens&#8217;d me to slander the Lady Hero, how you were brought into the orchard, and saw me court Margaret in Hero&#8217;s garments, how you disgrac&#8217;d her when you should marry her. 
My villainy they have upon record, which I had rather seal with my death than repeat over to my shame. The lady is dead upon mine and my master&#8217;s false accusation; and briefly, I desire nothing but the reward of a villain.</line>

<scenedescription>Friar Francis, Leonato, Antonio and Benedick reflect on what has been learned, excusing the Prince and Claudio; Benedick is glad that he will no longer have to fight Claudio. They send the ladies away with instructions to return masked when they are called for. Benedick asks Leonato for Beatrice&#8217;s hand. Don Pedro and Claudio arrive in good spirits. Claudio reaffirms his willingness to marry whichever lady is given to him, and the masked ladies enter. Before he is allowed to see her face, Claudio takes Hero by the hand and swears to marry her – and then he discovers that she is the still-living Hero. Friar Francis offers to explain everything once the marriage is over, but before they can make their way to the church, Benedick publically asks Beatrice whether she loves him. She denies it as much as he denies loving her, while they work out that they have been set up. They decide to marry nevertheless, and Don Pedro mocks Benedick for marrying, despite all his promises, but Benedick will not rise to the bait and instead urges the Prince to marry as well. Benedick insists that they dance before getting married, though Leonato thinks it more proper to wait till after. News comes that Don John has been captured, but Benedick tells people to forget about him until the next day, and they all begin to dance.</scenedescription>
