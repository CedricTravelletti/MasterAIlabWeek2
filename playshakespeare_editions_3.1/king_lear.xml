<STAGEDIR>Enter Kent, Gloucester, and Edmund.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I thought the King had more affected the Duke of Albany than Cornwall.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It did always seem so to us; but now in the division of the kingdom, it appears not which of the Dukes he values most, for equalities are so weigh&#8217;d, that curiosity in neither can make choice of either&#8217;s moi&#8217;ty.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is not this your son, my lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>His breeding, sir, hath been at my charge. I have so often blush&#8217;d to acknowledge him, that now I am braz&#8217;d to&#8217;t.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I cannot conceive you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, this young fellow&#8217;s mother could; whereupon she grew round-womb&#8217;d, and had indeed, sir, a son for her cradle ere she had a husband for her bed. Do you smell a fault?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I cannot wish the fault undone, the issue of it being so proper.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But I have a son, sir, by order of law, some year elder than this, who yet is no dearer in my account. Though this knave came something saucily to the world before he was sent for, yet was his mother fair, there was good sport at his making, and the whoreson must be acknowledg&#8217;d. Do you know this noble gentleman, Edmund?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My Lord of Kent. Remember him hereafter as my honorable friend.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My services to your lordship.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I must love you, and sue to know you better.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, I shall study deserving.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He hath been out nine years, and away he shall again.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Sound a sennet.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>The King is coming.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter one bearing a coronet, then King Lear, Cornwall, Albany, Goneril, Regan, Cordelia, and Attendants.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Attend the lords of France and Burgundy, Gloucester.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I shall, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>
<STAGEDIR>Exit with Edmund.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Mean time we shall express our darker purpose.</LINE>
<LINE>Give me the map there. Know that we have divided</LINE>
<LINE>In three our kingdom; and &#8217;tis our fast intent</LINE>
<LINE>To shake all cares and business from our age,</LINE>
<LINE>Conferring them on younger strengths, while we</LINE>
<LINE>Unburden&#8217;d crawl toward death. Our son of Cornwall,</LINE>
<LINE>And you, our no less loving son of Albany,</LINE>
<LINE>We have this hour a constant will to publish</LINE>
<LINE>Our daughters&#8217; several dowers, that future strife</LINE>
<LINE>May be prevented now. The princes, France and Burgundy,</LINE>
<LINE>Great rivals in our youngest daughter&#8217;s love,</LINE>
<LINE>Long in our court have made their amorous sojourn,</LINE>
<LINE>And here are to be answer&#8217;d. Tell me, my daughters</LINE>
<LINE>(Since now we will divest us both of rule,</LINE>
<LINE>Interest of territory, cares of state),</LINE>
<LINE>Which of you shall we say doth love us most,</LINE>
<LINE>That we our largest bounty may extend</LINE>
<LINE>Where nature doth with merit challenge? Goneril,</LINE>
<LINE>Our eldest-born, speak first.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, I love you more than words can wield the matter,</LINE>
<LINE>Dearer than eyesight, space, and liberty,</LINE>
<LINE>Beyond what can be valued, rich or rare,</LINE>
<LINE>No less than life, with grace, health, beauty, honor;</LINE>
<LINE>As much as child e&#8217;er lov&#8217;d, or father found;</LINE>
<LINE>A love that makes breath poor, and speech unable:</LINE>
<LINE>Beyond all manner of so much I love you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COR.</SPEAKER>
<STAGEDIR>Aside.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>What shall Cordelia speak? Love, and be silent.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Of all these bounds, even from this line to this,</LINE>
<LINE>With shadowy forests and with champains rich&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>With plenteous rivers and wide&#8212;skirted meads,</LINE>
<LINE>We make thee lady. To thine and Albany&#8217;s issue</LINE>
<LINE>Be this perpetual. What says our second daughter,</LINE>
<LINE>Our dearest Regan, wife of Cornwall? Speak.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REG.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am made of that self metal as my sister,</LINE>
<LINE>And prize me at her worth. In my true heart</LINE>
<LINE>I find she names my very deed of love;</LINE>
<LINE>Only she comes too short, that I profess</LINE>
<LINE>Myself an enemy to all other joys</LINE>
<LINE>Which the most precious square of sense possesses,</LINE>
<LINE>And find I am alone felicitate</LINE>
<LINE>In your dear Highness&#8217; love.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COR.</SPEAKER>
<STAGEDIR>Aside.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE offset="5">Then poor Cordelia!</LINE>
<LINE>And yet not so, since I am sure my love&#8217;s</LINE>
<LINE>More ponderous than my tongue.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To thee and thine hereditary ever</LINE>
<LINE>Remain this ample third of our fair kingdom,</LINE>
<LINE>No less in space, validity, and pleasure,</LINE>
<LINE>Than that conferr&#8217;d on Goneril.&#8212;Now, our joy,</LINE>
<LINE>Although our last and least, to whose young love</LINE>
<LINE>The vines of France and milk of Burgundy</LINE>
<LINE>Strive to be interess&#8217;d, what can you say to draw</LINE>
<LINE>A third more opulent than your sisters&#8217;? Speak.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nothing, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nothing?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nothing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nothing will come of nothing, speak again.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave</LINE>
<LINE>My heart into my mouth. I love your Majesty</LINE>
<LINE>According to my bond, no more nor less.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How, how, Cordelia? Mend your speech a little,</LINE>
<LINE>Lest you may mar your fortunes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">Good my lord,</LINE>
<LINE>You have begot me, bred me, lov&#8217;d me: I</LINE>
<LINE>Return those duties back as are right fit,</LINE>
<LINE>Obey you, love you, and most honor you.</LINE>
<LINE>Why have my sisters husbands, if they say</LINE>
<LINE>They love you all? Happily, when I shall wed,</LINE>
<LINE>That lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry</LINE>
<LINE>Half my love with him, half my care and duty.</LINE>
<LINE>Sure I shall never marry like my sisters,</LINE>
<LINE>To love my father all.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But goes thy heart with this?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">Ay, my good lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So young, and so untender?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So young, my lord, and true.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let it be so: thy truth then be thy dow&#8217;r!</LINE>
<LINE>For by the sacred radiance of the sun,</LINE>
<LINE>The mysteries of Hecat and the night;</LINE>
<LINE>By all the operation of the orbs,</LINE>
<LINE>From whom we do exist and cease to be;</LINE>
<LINE>Here I disclaim all my paternal care,</LINE>
<LINE>Propinquity and property of blood,</LINE>
<LINE>And as a stranger to my heart and me</LINE>
<LINE>Hold thee from this forever. The barbarous Scythian,</LINE>
<LINE>Or he that makes his generation messes</LINE>
<LINE>To gorge his appetite, shall to my bosom</LINE>
<LINE>Be as well neighbor&#8217;d, pitied, and reliev&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>As thou my sometime daughter.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">Good my liege&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Peace, Kent!</LINE>
<LINE>Come not between the dragon and his wrath;</LINE>
<LINE>I lov&#8217;d her most, and thought to set my rest</LINE>
<LINE>On her kind nursery.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>To Cordelia.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE offset="4">Hence, and avoid my sight!&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>So be my grave my peace, as here I give</LINE>
<LINE>Her father&#8217;s heart from her. Call France. Who stirs?</LINE>
<LINE>Call Burgundy. Cornwall and Albany,</LINE>
<LINE>With my two daughters&#8217; dow&#8217;rs digest the third;</LINE>
<LINE>Let pride, which she calls plainness, marry her.</LINE>
<LINE>I do invest you jointly with my power,</LINE>
<LINE>Pre-eminence, and all the large effects</LINE>
<LINE>That troop with majesty. Ourself, by monthly course,</LINE>
<LINE>With reservation of an hundred knights</LINE>
<LINE>By you to be sustain&#8217;d, shall our abode</LINE>
<LINE>Make with you by due turn. Only we shall retain</LINE>
<LINE>The name, and all th&#8217; addition to a king;</LINE>
<LINE>The sway, revenue, execution of the rest,</LINE>
<LINE>Beloved sons, be yours, which to confirm,</LINE>
<LINE>This coronet part between you.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">Royal Lear,</LINE>
<LINE>Whom I have ever honor&#8217;d as my king,</LINE>
<LINE>Lov&#8217;d as my father, as my master follow&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>As my great patron thought on in my prayers&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The bow is bent and drawn, make from the shaft.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let it fall rather, though the fork invade</LINE>
<LINE>The region of my heart; be Kent unmannerly</LINE>
<LINE>When Lear is mad. What wouldest thou do, old man?</LINE>
<LINE>Think&#8217;st thou that duty shall have dread to speak</LINE>
<LINE>When power to flattery bows? To plainness honor&#8217;s bound,</LINE>
<LINE>When majesty falls to folly. Reserve thy state,</LINE>
<LINE>And in thy best consideration check</LINE>
<LINE>This hideous rashness. Answer my life my judgment,</LINE>
<LINE>Thy youngest daughter does not love thee least,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor are those empty&#8212;hearted whose low sounds</LINE>
<LINE>Reverb no hollowness.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Kent, on thy life, no more.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My life I never held but as a pawn</LINE>
<LINE>To wage against thine enemies, ne&#8217;er fear&#8217;d to lose it,</LINE>
<LINE>Thy safety being motive.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Out of my sight!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>See better, Lear, and let me still remain</LINE>
<LINE>The true blank of thine eye.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, by Apollo&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Now, by Apollo, King,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou swear&#8217;st thy gods in vain.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEAKER>LEAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">O vassal! Miscreant!</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALB., CORN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Dear sir, forbear.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Kill thy physician, and the fee bestow</LINE>
<LINE>Upon the foul disease. Revoke thy gift,</LINE>
<LINE>Or whilst I can vent clamor from my throat,</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll tell thee thou dost evil.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Hear me, recreant,</LINE>
<LINE>On thine allegiance, hear me!</LINE>
<LINE>That thou hast sought to make us break our vow&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Which we durst never yet&#8212;and with strain&#8217;d pride</LINE>
<LINE>To come betwixt our sentence and our power,</LINE>
<LINE>Which nor our nature nor our place can bear,</LINE>
<LINE>Our potency made good, take thy reward.</LINE>
<LINE>Five days we do allot thee, for provision</LINE>
<LINE>To shield thee from disasters of the world,</LINE>
<LINE>And on the sixt to turn thy hated back</LINE>
<LINE>Upon our kingdom. If, on the tenth day following,</LINE>
<LINE>Thy banish&#8217;d trunk be found in our dominions,</LINE>
<LINE>The moment is thy death. Away! By Jupiter,</LINE>
<LINE>This shall not be revok&#8217;d.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fare thee well, King; sith thus thou wilt appear,</LINE>
<LINE>Freedom lives hence, and banishment is here.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>To Cordelia.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>The gods to their dear shelter take thee, maid,</LINE>
<LINE>That justly think&#8217;st and hast most rightly said!</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>To Regan and Goneril.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>And your large speeches may your deeds approve,</LINE>
<LINE>That good effects may spring from words of love.</LINE>
<LINE>Thus Kent, O princes, bids you all <FRENCH lang="fr">adieu</FRENCH>,</LINE>
<LINE>He&#8217;ll shape his old course in a country new.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here&#8217;s France and Burgundy, my noble lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My Lord of Burgundy,</LINE>
<LINE>We first address toward you, who with this king</LINE>
<LINE>Hath rivall&#8217;d for our daughter. What, in the least,</LINE>
<LINE>Will you require in present dower with her,</LINE>
<LINE>Or cease your quest of love?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BUR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">Most royal Majesty,</LINE>
<LINE>I crave no more than hath your Highness offer&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor will you tender less.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Right noble Burgundy,</LINE>
<LINE>When she was dear to us, we did hold her so,</LINE>
<LINE>But now her price is fallen. Sir, there she stands:</LINE>
<LINE>If aught within that little seeming substance,</LINE>
<LINE>Or all of it, with our displeasure piec&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>And nothing more, may fitly like your Grace,</LINE>
<LINE>She&#8217;s there, and she is yours.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>BUR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">I know no answer.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Will you, with those infirmities she owes,</LINE>
<LINE>Unfriended, new adopted to our hate,</LINE>
<LINE>Dow&#8217;r&#8217;d with our curse, and stranger&#8217;d with our oath,</LINE>
<LINE>Take her, or leave her?</LINE>

<LINE offset="5">Pardon me, royal sir,</LINE>
<LINE>Election makes not up in such conditions.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>LEAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then leave her, sir, for by the pow&#8217;r that made me,</LINE>
<LINE>I tell you all her wealth.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>To France.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE offset="5">For you, great King,</LINE>
<LINE>I would not from your love make such a stray</LINE>
<LINE>To match you where I hate; therefore beseech you</LINE>
<LINE>T&#8217; avert your liking a more worthier way</LINE>
<LINE>Than on a wretch whom Nature is asham&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>Almost t&#8217; acknowledge hers.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRANCE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">This is most strange,</LINE>
<LINE>That she, whom even but now was your best object,</LINE>
<LINE>The argument of your praise, balm of your age,</LINE>
<LINE>The best, the dearest, should in this trice of time</LINE>
<LINE>Commit a thing so monstrous, to dismantle</LINE>
<LINE>So many folds of favor. Sure her offense</LINE>
<LINE>Must be of such unnatural degree</LINE>
<LINE>That monsters it, or your fore-vouch&#8217;d affection</LINE>
<LINE>Fall into taint; which to believe of her</LINE>
<LINE>Must be a faith that reason without miracle</LINE>
<LINE>Should never plant in me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">I yet beseech your Majesty&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>If for I want that glib and oily art</LINE>
<LINE>To speak and purpose not, since what I well intend,</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll do&#8217;t before I speak&#8212;that you make known</LINE>
<LINE>It is no vicious blot, murder, or foulness,</LINE>
<LINE>No unchaste action, or dishonored step,</LINE>
<LINE>That hath depriv&#8217;d me of your grace and favor,</LINE>
<LINE>But even for want of that for which I am richer&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>A still-soliciting eye, and such a tongue</LINE>
<LINE>That I am glad I have not, though not to have it</LINE>
<LINE>Hath lost me in your liking.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEAR.</SPEAKER>

<LINE>Hadst not been born than not t&#8217; have pleas&#8217;d me better.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRANCE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is it but this&#8212;a tardiness in nature</LINE>
<LINE>Which often leaves the history unspoke</LINE>
<LINE>That it intends to do? My Lord of Burgundy,</LINE>
<LINE>What say you to the lady? Love&#8217;s not love</LINE>
<LINE>When it is mingled with regards that stands</LINE>
<LINE>Aloof from th&#8217; entire point. Will you have her?</LINE>
<LINE>She is herself a dowry.</LINE>

<LINE>Gods, gods! &#8217;tis strange that from their cold&#8217;st neglect</LINE>

<LINE>Thy dow&#8217;rless daughter, King, thrown to my chance,</LINE>

<LINE>Not all the dukes of wat&#8217;rish Burgundy</LINE>

<LINE>Cordelia leaves you. I know you what you are,</LINE>

<LINE>Your faults as they are named. Love well our father;</LINE>
<LINE>To your professed bosoms I commit him,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REG.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That&#8217;s most certain, and with you; next month with us.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You see how full of changes his age is; the observation we have made of it hath not been little. He always lov&#8217;d our sister most, and with what poor judgment he hath now cast her off appears too grossly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REG.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis the infirmity of his age, yet he hath ever but slenderly known himself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The best and soundest of his time hath been but rash; then must we look from his age to receive not alone the imperfections of long-ingraff&#8217;d condition, but therewithal the unruly waywardness that infirm and choleric years bring with them.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Such unconstant starts are we like to have from him as this of Kent&#8217;s banishment.</LINE>

<LINE>There is further compliment of leave-taking between France and him. Pray you let us hit together; if our father carry authority with such disposition as he bears, this last surrender of his will but offend us.</LINE>

<LINE>Thou, Nature, art my goddess, to thy law</LINE>

<LINE>Stand in the plague of custom, and permit</LINE>
<LINE>The curiosity of nations to deprive me,</LINE>
<LINE>For that I am some twelve or fourteen moonshines</LINE>
<LINE>Lag of a brother? Why bastard? Wherefore base?</LINE>
<LINE>When my dimensions are as well compact,</LINE>
<LINE>My mind as generous, and my shape as true,</LINE>
<LINE>As honest madam&#8217;s issue? Why brand they us</LINE>
<LINE>With base? With baseness? Bastardy? Base, base?</LINE>
<LINE>Who, in the lusty stealth of nature, take</LINE>
<LINE>More composition, and fierce quality,</LINE>
<LINE>Than doth within a dull, stale, tired bed</LINE>
<LINE>Go to th&#8217; creating a whole tribe of fops,</LINE>
<LINE>Got &#8217;tween asleep and wake? Well then,</LINE>
<LINE>Legitimate Edgar, I must have your land.</LINE>
<LINE>Our father&#8217;s love is to the bastard Edmund</LINE>
<LINE>As to th&#8217; legitimate. Fine word, &#8220;legitimate&#8221;!</LINE>
<LINE>Well, my legitimate, if this letter speed</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No? What needed then that terrible dispatch of it into your pocket? The quality of nothing hath not such need to hide itself. Let&#8217;s see. Come, if it be nothing, I shall not need spectacles.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I beseech you, sir, pardon me. It is a letter from my brother that I have not all o&#8217;er-read; and for so much as I have perus&#8217;d, I find it not fit for your o&#8217;erlooking.</LINE>

<LINE>Give me the letter, sir.</LINE>

If our father would sleep till I wak&#8217;d him, you should enjoy half his revenue forever, and live the belov&#8217;d of your brother. Edgar.&#8221;</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE>Hum? Conspiracy? <RECITE>&#8220;Sleep till I wake him, you should enjoy half his revenue.&#8221;</RECITE> My son Edgar! Had he a hand to write this? A heart and brain to breed it in?&#8212;When came you to this? Who brought it?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It was not brought me, my lord; there&#8217;s the cunning of it. I found it thrown in at the casement of my closet.</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Has he never before sounded you in this business?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Never, my lord. But I have heard him oft maintain it to be fit that, sons at perfect age and fathers declin&#8217;d, the father should be as ward to the son, and the son manage his revenue.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O villain, villain! His very opinion in the letter. Abhorred villain! Unnatural, detested, brutish villain! Worse than brutish! Go, sirrah, seek him; I&#8217;ll apprehend him. Abominable villain! Where is he?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do not well know, my lord. If it shall please you to suspend your indignation against my brother till you can derive from him better testimony of his intent, you should run a certain course; where, if you violently proceed against him, mistaking his purpose, it would make a great gap in your own honor and shake in pieces the heart of his obedience. I dare pawn down my life for him that he hath writ this to feel my affection to your honor, and to no other pretense of danger.</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>To his father, that so tenderly and entirely loves him. Heaven and earth! Edmund, seek him out; wind me into him, I pray you. Frame the business after your own wisdom. I would unstate myself to be in a due resolution.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will seek him, sir, presently; convey the business as I shall find means, and acquaint you withal.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>These late eclipses in the sun and moon portend no good to us. Though the wisdom of nature can reason it thus and thus, yet nature finds itself scourg&#8217;d by the sequent effects. Love cools, friendship falls off, brothers divide: in cities, mutinies; in countries, discord; in palaces, treason; and the bond crack&#8217;d &#8217;twixt son and father. This villain of mine comes under the prediction; there&#8217;s son against father: the King falls from bias of nature; there&#8217;s father against child. We have seen the best of our time. Machinations, hollowness, treachery, and all ruinous disorders follow us disquietly to our graves. Find out this villain, Edmund, it shall lose thee nothing, do it carefully. And the noble and true-hearted Kent banish&#8217;d! His offense, honesty! &#8217;Tis strange.</LINE>
</SPEECH>
<STAGEDIR>Exit.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This is the excellent foppery of the world, that when we are sick in fortune&#8212;often the surfeits of our own behavior&#8212;we make guilty of our disasters the sun, the moon, and stars, as if we were villains on necessity, fools by heavenly compulsion, knaves, thieves, and treachers by spherical predominance; drunkards, liars, and adulterers by an enforc&#8217;d obedience of planetary influence; and all that we are evil in, by a divine thrusting on. An admirable evasion of whoremaster man, to lay his goatish disposition on the charge of a star! My father compounded with my mother under the Dragon&#8217;s tail, and my nativity was under Ursa Major, so that it follows, I am rough and lecherous. Fut, I should have been that I am, had the maidenl&#8217;est star in the firmament twinkled on my bastardizing. Edgar&#8212;</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Edgar.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Pat! He comes like the catastrophe of the old comedy. My cue is villainous melancholy, with a sigh like Tom o&#8217; Bedlam.&#8212;O, these eclipses do portend these divisions! Fa, sol, la, mi.</LINE>

<LINE>How now, brother Edmund, what serious contemplation are you in?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>I am thinking, brother, of a prediction I read this other day, what should follow these eclipses.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDG.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do you busy yourself with that?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I promise you, the effects he writes of succeed unhappily, as of unnaturalness between the child and the parent, death, dearth, dissolutions of ancient amities, divisions in state, menaces and maledictions against king and nobles, needless diffidences, banishment of friends, dissipation of cohorts, nuptial breaches, and I know not what.</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Bethink yourself wherein you may have offended him; and at my entreaty forbear his presence until some little time hath qualified the heat of his displeasure, which at this instant so rageth in him, that with the mischief of your person it would scarcely allay.</LINE>

<LINE>Some villain hath done me wrong.</LINE>

<LINE>That&#8217;s my fear. I pray you have a continent forbearance till the speed of his rage goes slower; and as I say, retire with me to my lodging, from whence I will fitly bring you to hear my lord speak. Pray ye go, there&#8217;s my key. If you do stir abroad, go arm&#8217;d.</LINE>

<LINE>The child was bound to th&#8217; father; sir, in fine,</LINE>

<LINE>To his unnatural purpose, in fell motion</LINE>
<LINE>With his prepared sword he charges home</LINE>

<LINE>Bold in the quarrel&#8217;s right, rous&#8217;d to th&#8217; encounter,</LINE>
<LINE>Or whether gasted by the noise I made,</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Why the King of France is so suddenly gone back, know you no reason?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Something he left imperfect in the state, which since his coming forth is thought of, which imports to the kingdom so much fear and danger that his personal return was most requir&#8217;d and necessary.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who hath he left behind him general?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The Marshal of France, Monsieur La Far.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Did your letters pierce the Queen to any demonstration of grief?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, sir, she took them, read them in my presence,</LINE>
<LINE>And now and then an ample tear trill&#8217;d down</LINE>
<LINE>Her delicate cheek. It seem&#8217;d she was a queen</LINE>
<LINE>Over her passion, who, most rebel-like,</LINE>
<LINE>Sought to be king o&#8217;er her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">O then it mov&#8217;d her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not to a rage, patience and sorrow strove</LINE>
<LINE>Who should express her goodliest. You have seen</LINE>
<LINE>Sunshine and rain at once; her smiles and tears</LINE>
<LINE>Were like a better way: those happy smilets</LINE>
<LINE>That play&#8217;d on her ripe lip seem&#8217;d not to know</LINE>
<LINE>What guests were in her eyes, which, parted thence,</LINE>
<LINE>As pearls from diamonds dropp&#8217;d. In brief,</LINE>
<LINE>Sorrow would be a rarity most beloved,</LINE>
<LINE>If all could so become it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Made she no verbal question?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Faith, once or twice she heav&#8217;d the name of &#8220;father&#8221;</LINE>
<LINE>Pantingly forth, as if it press&#8217;d her heart;</LINE>
<LINE>Cried, &#8220;Sisters, sisters! Shame of ladies, sisters!</LINE>
<LINE>Kent! Father! Sisters! What, i&#8217; th&#8217; storm? I&#8217; th&#8217; night?</LINE>
<LINE>Let pity not be believ&#8217;d!&#8221; There she shook</LINE>

<LINE>And, clamor-moistened, then away she started</LINE>
<LINE>To deal with grief alone.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">It is the stars,</LINE>
<LINE>The stars above us, govern our conditions,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">Why, good sir?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A sovereign shame so elbows him: his own unkindness,</LINE>
<LINE>That stripp&#8217;d her from his benediction, turn&#8217;d her</LINE>
<LINE>To foreign casualties, gave her dear rights</LINE>
<LINE>To his dog-hearted daughters&#8212;these things sting</LINE>
<LINE>His mind so venomously, that burning shame</LINE>
<LINE>Detains him from Cordelia.</LINE>

<LINE>Well, sir, I&#8217;ll bring you to our master Lear,</LINE>

<SPEAKER>REG.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Faith, he is posted hence on serious matter.</LINE>
<LINE>It was great ignorance, Gloucester&#8217;s eyes being out,</LINE>

<LINE>I know your lady does not love her husband,</LINE>

<LINE>Ha! Goneril with a white beard? They flatter&#8217;d me like a dog, and told me I had the white hairs in my beard ere the black ones were there. To say &#8220;ay&#8221; and &#8220;no&#8221; to every thing that I said! &#8220;Ay,&#8221; and &#8220;no&#8221; too, was no good divinity. When the rain came to wet me once, and the wind to make me chatter, when the thunder would not peace at my bidding, there I found &#8217;em, there I smelt &#8217;em out.

<LINE>Thy valor, and thy heart, thou art a traitor;</LINE>
<LINE>False to thy gods, thy brother, and thy father,</LINE>
<LINE>Conspirant &#8217;gainst this high illustrious prince,</LINE>
<LINE>And from th&#8217; extremest upward of thy head</LINE>
<LINE>To the descent and dust below thy foot,</LINE>
<LINE>A most toad-spotted traitor. Say thou &#8220;No,&#8221;</LINE>
<LINE>This sword, this arm, and my best spirits are bent</LINE>
<LINE>To prove upon thy heart, whereto I speak,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou liest.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="2">In wisdom I should ask thy name,</LINE>
<LINE>But since thy outside looks so fair and warlike,</LINE>
<LINE>And that thy tongue some say of breeding breathes,</LINE>
<LINE>What safe and nicely I might well delay</LINE>
<LINE>By rule of knighthood, I disdain and spurn.</LINE>
<LINE>Back do I toss these treasons to thy head,</LINE>
<LINE>With the hell-hated lie o&#8217;erwhelm thy heart,</LINE>
<LINE>Which for they yet glance by, and scarcely bruise,</LINE>
<LINE>This sword of mine shall give them instant way</LINE>
<LINE>Where they shall rest forever. Trumpets, speak!</LINE>
</SPEECH>
<STAGEDIR>Alarums. They fight. Edmund falls.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALB.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Save him, save him!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">This is practice, Gloucester.</LINE>
<LINE>By th&#8217; law of war thou wast not bound to answer</LINE>
<LINE>An unknown opposite. Thou art not vanquish&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>But cozen&#8217;d and beguil&#8217;d.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALB.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Shut your mouth, dame,</LINE>
<LINE>Or with this paper shall I stopple it. Hold, sir.&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Thou worse than any name, read thine own evil.</LINE>
<LINE>No tearing, lady, I perceive you know it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Say if I do, the laws are mine, not thine;</LINE>
<LINE>Who can arraign me for&#8217;t?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALB.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Most monstrous! O!</LINE>
<LINE>Know&#8217;st thou this paper?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Ask me not what I know.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALB.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go after her; she&#8217;s desperate, govern her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What you have charg&#8217;d me with, that have I done,</LINE>
<LINE>And more, much more, the time will bring it out.</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis past, and so am I. But what art thou</LINE>
<LINE>That hast this fortune on me? If thou&#8217;rt noble,</LINE>
<LINE>I do forgive thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDG.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Let&#8217;s exchange charity.</LINE>
<LINE>I am no less in blood than thou art, Edmund;</LINE>
<LINE>If more, the more th&#8217; hast wrong&#8217;d me.</LINE>
<LINE>My name is Edgar, and thy father&#8217;s son.</LINE>
<LINE>The gods are just, and of our pleasant vices</LINE>
<LINE>Make instruments to plague us:</LINE>
<LINE>The dark and vicious place where thee he got</LINE>
<LINE>Cost him his eyes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">th&#8217; hast spoken right, &#8217;tis true.</LINE>
<LINE>The wheel is come full circle, I am here.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALB.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Methought thy very gait did prophesy</LINE>
<LINE>A royal nobleness. I must embrace thee.</LINE>
<LINE>Let sorrow split my heart, if ever I</LINE>
<LINE>Did hate thee or thy father.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDG.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Worthy prince, I know&#8217;t.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALB.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Where have you hid yourself?</LINE>
<LINE>How have you known the miseries of your father?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDG.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By nursing them, my lord. List a brief tale,</LINE>
<LINE>And when &#8217;tis told, O that my heart would burst!</LINE>
<LINE>The bloody proclamation to escape,</LINE>
<LINE>That follow&#8217;d me so near (O, our lives&#8217; sweetness!</LINE>
<LINE>That we the pain of death would hourly die</LINE>
<LINE>Rather than die at once!), taught me to shift</LINE>
<LINE>Into a madman&#8217;s rags, t&#8217; assume a semblance</LINE>
<LINE>That very dogs disdain&#8217;d; and in this habit</LINE>
<LINE>Met I my father with his bleeding rings,</LINE>
<LINE>Their precious stones new lost; became his guide,</LINE>
<LINE>Led him, begg&#8217;d for him, sav&#8217;d him from despair;</LINE>
<LINE>Never (O fault!) reveal&#8217;d myself unto him,</LINE>
<LINE>Until some half hour past, when I was arm&#8217;d.</LINE>
<LINE>Not sure, though hoping, of this good success,</LINE>
<LINE>I ask&#8217;d his blessing, and from first to last</LINE>
<LINE>Told him our pilgrimage. But his flaw&#8217;d heart</LINE>
<LINE>(Alack, too weak the conflict to support!)</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Twixt two extremes of passion, joy and grief,</LINE>
<LINE>Burst smilingly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="3">This speech of yours hath mov&#8217;d me,</LINE>
<LINE>And shall perchance do good: but speak you on,</LINE>
<LINE>You look as you had something more to say.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALB.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If there be more, more woeful, hold it in,</LINE>
<LINE>For I am almost ready to dissolve,</LINE>
<LINE>Hearing of this.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDG.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="3">This would have seem&#8217;d a period</LINE>
<LINE>To such as love not sorrow, but another,</LINE>
<LINE>To amplify too much, would make much more,</LINE>
<LINE>And top extremity. Whilst I</LINE>
<LINE>Was big in clamor, came there in a man,</LINE>
<LINE>Who, having seen me in my worst estate,</LINE>
<LINE>Shunn&#8217;d my abhorr&#8217;d society, but then finding</LINE>
<LINE>Who &#8217;twas that so endur&#8217;d, with his strong arms</LINE>
<LINE>He fastened on my neck and bellowed out</LINE>
<LINE>As he&#8217;d burst heaven, threw him on my father,</LINE>
<LINE>Told the most piteous tale of Lear and him</LINE>
<LINE>That ever ear received, which in recounting,</LINE>
<LINE>His grief grew puissant and the strings of life</LINE>
<LINE>Began to crack. Twice then the trumpets sounded,</LINE>
<LINE>And there I left him tranc&#8217;d.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALB.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">But who was this?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDG.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Kent, sir, the banish&#8217;d Kent, who in disguise</LINE>
<LINE>Followed his enemy king, and did him service</LINE>
<LINE>Improper for a slave.</LINE>
</SPEECH>
<STAGEDIR>Enter a Gentleman with a bloody knife.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Help, help! O, help!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDG.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">What kind of help?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALB.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="8">Speak, man.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDG.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What means this bloody knife?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">&#8217;Tis hot, it smokes,</LINE>
<LINE>It came even from the heart of&#8212;O, she&#8217;s dead!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALB.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who dead? Speak, man.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your lady, sir, your lady; and her sister</LINE>
<LINE>By her is poison&#8217;d; she confesses it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I was contracted to them both; all three</LINE>
<LINE>Now marry in an instant.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDG.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Here comes Kent.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Kent.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALB.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Produce the bodies, be they alive or dead.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exit Gentleman.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>This judgment of the heavens, that makes us tremble,</LINE>
<LINE>Touches us not with pity.&#8212;O, is this he?</LINE>
<LINE>The time will not allow the compliment</LINE>
<LINE>Which very manners urges.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">I am come</LINE>
<LINE>To bid my king and master aye good night.</LINE>
<LINE>Is he not here?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALB.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="3">Great thing of us forgot!</LINE>
<LINE>Speak, Edmund, where&#8217;s the King? And where&#8217;s Cordelia?</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Goneril and Regan&#8217;s bodies brought out.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Seest thou this object, Kent?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alack, why thus?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Yet Edmund was belov&#8217;d!</LINE>
<LINE>The one the other poison&#8217;d for my sake,</LINE>
<LINE>And after slew herself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALB.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Even so. Cover their faces.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I pant for life. Some good I mean to do,</LINE>
<LINE>Despite of mine own nature. Quickly send</LINE>
<LINE>(Be brief in it) to th&#8217; castle, for my writ</LINE>
<LINE>Is on the life of Lear and on Cordelia.</LINE>
<LINE>Nay, send in time.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALB.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Run, run, O, run!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDG.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To who, my lord? Who has the office? Send</LINE>
<LINE>Thy token of reprieve.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well thought on. Take my sword. The captain&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Give it the captain.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALB.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Haste thee, for thy life.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit Edgar.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He hath commission from thy wife and me</LINE>
<LINE>To hang Cordelia in the prison, and</LINE>
<LINE>To lay the blame upon her own despair,</LINE>
<LINE>That she fordid herself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALB.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The gods defend her! Bear him hence awhile.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Edmund is borne off.</STAGEDIR>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Lear with Cordelia in his arms, Edgar and a Gentleman following.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Howl, howl, howl! O, you are men of stones!</LINE>
<LINE>Had I your tongues and eyes, I&#8217;ld use them so</LINE>
<LINE>That heaven&#8217;s vault should crack. She&#8217;s gone forever!</LINE>
<LINE>I know when one is dead, and when one lives;</LINE>
<LINE>She&#8217;s dead as earth. Lend me a looking-glass,</LINE>
<LINE>If that her breath will mist or stain the stone,</LINE>
<LINE>Why then she lives.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Is this the promis&#8217;d end?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDG.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Or image of that horror?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALB.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Fall, and cease!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This feather stirs, she lives! If it be so,</LINE>
<LINE>It is a chance which does redeem all sorrows</LINE>
<LINE>That ever I have felt.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT.</SPEAKER>
<STAGEDIR>Kneeling.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE offset="4">O my good master!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Prithee away.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDG.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="3">&#8217;Tis noble Kent, your friend.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A plague upon you, murderers, traitors all!</LINE>
<LINE>I might have sav&#8217;d her, now she&#8217;s gone forever!</LINE>
<LINE>Cordelia, Cordelia, stay a little. Ha!</LINE>
<LINE>What is&#8217;t thou say&#8217;st? Her voice was ever soft,</LINE>
<LINE>Gentle, and low, an excellent thing in woman.</LINE>
<LINE>I kill&#8217;d the slave that was a-hanging thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis true, my lords, he did.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Did I not, fellow?</LINE>
<LINE>I have seen the day, with my good biting falchion</LINE>
<LINE>I would have made them skip. I am old now,</LINE>
<LINE>And these same crosses spoil me. Who are you?</LINE>
<LINE>Mine eyes are not o&#8217; th&#8217; best; I&#8217;ll tell you straight.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If Fortune brag of two she lov&#8217;d and hated,</LINE>
<LINE>One of them we behold.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This is a dull sight. Are you not Kent?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="8">The same:</LINE>
<LINE>Your servant Kent. Where is your servant Caius?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He&#8217;s a good fellow, I can tell you that;</LINE>
<LINE>He&#8217;ll strike, and quickly too. He&#8217;s dead and rotten.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, my good lord, I am the very man&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll see that straight.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That from your first of difference and decay,</LINE>
<LINE>Have follow&#8217;d your sad steps&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">You are welcome hither.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nor no man else. All&#8217;s cheerless, dark, and deadly.</LINE>
<LINE>Your eldest daughters have foredone themselves,</LINE>
<LINE>And desperately are dead.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Ay, so I think.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALB.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He knows not what he says, and vain is it</LINE>
<LINE>That we present us to him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDG.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Very bootless.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter a Messenger.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MESS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Edmund is dead, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALB.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">That&#8217;s but a trifle here.</LINE>
<LINE>You lords and noble friends, know our intent.</LINE>
<LINE>What comfort to this great decay may come</LINE>
<LINE>Shall be applied. For us, we will resign,</LINE>
<LINE>During the life of this old majesty,</LINE>
<LINE>To him our absolute power.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>To Edgar and Kent.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE offset="6">You, to your rights,</LINE>
<LINE>With boot, and such addition as your honors</LINE>
<LINE>Have more than merited. All friends shall taste</LINE>
<LINE>The wages of their virtue, and all foes</LINE>
<LINE>The cup of their deservings. O, see, see!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And my poor fool is hang&#8217;d! No, no, no life!</LINE>
<LINE>Why should a dog, a horse, a rat, have life,</LINE>
<LINE>And thou no breath at all? Thou&#8217;lt come no more,</LINE>
<LINE>Never, never, never, never, never.</LINE>
<LINE>Pray you undo this button. Thank you, sir.</LINE>
<LINE>Do you see this? Look on her! Look her lips,</LINE>
<LINE>Look there, look there!</LINE>
</SPEECH>
<STAGEDIR>He dies.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDG.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">He faints. My lord, my lord!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Break, heart, I prithee break!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDG.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">Look up, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Vex not his ghost. O, let him pass, he hates him</LINE>
<LINE>That would upon the rack of this tough world</LINE>
<LINE>Stretch him out longer.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDG.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">He is gone indeed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The wonder is he hath endur&#8217;d so long,</LINE>
<LINE>He but usurp&#8217;d his life.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALB.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Bear them from hence. Our present business</LINE>
<LINE>Is general woe.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>To Kent and Edgar.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE offset="3">Friends of my soul, you twain</LINE>
<LINE>Rule in this realm, and the gor&#8217;d state sustain.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have a journey, sir, shortly to go:</LINE>
<LINE>My master calls me, I must not say no.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDG.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The weight of this sad time we must obey,</LINE>
<LINE>Speak what we feel, not what we ought to say:</LINE>
<LINE>The oldest hath borne most; we that are young</LINE>
<LINE>Shall never see so much, nor live so long.</LINE>
</SPEECH>
<STAGEDIR>Exeunt with a dead march.</STAGEDIR>
