<stagedir>Enter two Gentlemen.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>1. GENT.</speaker>
<line>You do not meet a man but frowns. Our bloods</line>
<line>No more obey the heavens than our courtiers&#8217;</line>
<line>Still seem as does the King&#8217;s.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. GENT.</speaker>
<line offset="6">But what&#8217;s the matter?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. GENT.</speaker>
<line>His daughter, and the heir of &#8217;s kingdom (whom</line>
<line>He purpos&#8217;d to his wive&#8217;s sole son&#8212;a widow</line>
<line>That late he married), hath referr&#8217;d herself</line>
<line>Unto a poor but worthy gentleman. She&#8217;s wedded,</line>
<line>Her husband banish&#8217;d, she imprison&#8217;d: all</line>
<line>Is outward sorrow, though I think the King</line>
<line>Be touch&#8217;d at very heart.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. GENT.</speaker>
<line offset="5">None but the King?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. GENT.</speaker>
<line>He that hath lost her too; so is the Queen,</line>
<line>That most desir&#8217;d the match. But not a courtier,</line>
<line>Although they wear their faces to the bent</line>
<line>Of the King&#8217;s looks, hath a heart that is not</line>
<line>Glad at the thing they scowl at.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. GENT.</speaker>
<line offset="7">And why so?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. GENT.</speaker>
<line>He that hath miss&#8217;d the Princess is a thing</line>
<line>Too bad for bad report; and he that hath her</line>
<line>(I mean, that married her, alack, good man!</line>
<line>And therefore banish&#8217;d) is a creature such</line>
<line>As, to seek through the regions of the earth</line>
<line>For one his like, there would be something failing</line>
<line>In him that should compare. I do not think</line>
<line>So fair an outward and such stuff within</line>
<line>Endows a man but he.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. GENT.</speaker>
<line offset="4">You speak him far.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. GENT.</speaker>
<line>I do extend him, sir, within himself,</line>
<line>Crush him together rather than unfold</line>
<line>His measure duly.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. GENT.</speaker>
<line offset="4">What&#8217;s his name and birth?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. GENT.</speaker>
<line>I cannot delve him to the root: his father</line>
<line>Was call&#8217;d Sicilius, who did join his honor</line>
<line>Against the Romans with Cassibelan,</line>
<line>But had his titles by Tenantius, whom</line>
<line>He serv&#8217;d with glory and admir&#8217;d success:</line>
<line>So gain&#8217;d the sur-addition Leonatus;</line>
<line>And had (besides this gentleman in question)</line>
<line>Two other sons, who in the wars o&#8217; th&#8217; time</line>
<line>Died with their swords in hand; for which their father,</line>
<line>Then old and fond of issue, took such sorrow</line>
<line>That he quit being, and his gentle lady,</line>
<line>Big of this gentleman, our theme, deceas&#8217;d</line>
<line>As he was born. The King he takes the babe</line>
<line>To his protection, calls him Posthumus Leonatus,</line>
<line>Breeds him and makes him of his bedchamber,</line>
<line>Puts to him all the learnings that his time</line>
<line>Could make him the receiver of, which he took,</line>
<line>As we do air, fast as &#8217;twas minist&#8217;red,</line>
<line>And in &#8217;s spring became a harvest; liv&#8217;d in court</line>
<line>(Which rare it is to do) most prais&#8217;d, most lov&#8217;d,</line>
<line>A sample to the youngest, to th&#8217; more mature</line>
<line>A glass that feated them, and to the graver</line>
<line>A child that guided dotards. To his mistress</line>
<line>(For whom he now is banish&#8217;d), her own price</line>
<line>Proclaims how she esteem&#8217;d him; and his virtue</line>
<line>By her election may be truly read,</line>
<line>What kind of man he is.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. GENT.</speaker>
<line offset="5">I honor him</line>
<line>Even out of your report. But pray you tell me,</line>
<line>Is she sole child to th&#8217; King?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. GENT.</speaker>
<line offset="6">His only child.</line>
<line>He had two sons (if this be worth your hearing,</line>
<line>Mark it), the eldest of them at three years old,</line>
<line>I&#8217; th&#8217; swathing clothes the other, from their nursery</line>
<line>Were stol&#8217;n, and to this hour no guess in knowledge</line>
<line>Which way they went.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. GENT.</speaker>
<line offset="4">How long is this ago?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. GENT.</speaker>
<line>Some twenty years.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. GENT.</speaker>
<line>That a king&#8217;s children should be so convey&#8217;d,</line>
<line>So slackly guarded, and the search so slow,</line>
<line>That could not trace them!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. GENT.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Howsoe&#8217;er &#8217;tis strange,</line>
<line>Or that the negligence may well be laugh&#8217;d at,</line>
<line>Yet is it true, sir.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. GENT.</speaker>
<line offset="3">I do well believe you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. GENT.</speaker>
<line>We must forbear. Here comes the gentleman,</line>
<line>The Queen, and Princess.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exeunt.</stagedir>
<stagedir>Enter the Queen, Posthumus, and Imogen.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>QUEEN.</speaker>
<line>No, be assur&#8217;d you shall not find me, daughter,</line>
<line>After the slander of most stepmothers,</line>
<line>Evil-ey&#8217;d unto you. You&#8217;re my prisoner, but</line>
<line>Your jailer shall deliver you the keys</line>
<line>That lock up your restraint. For you, Posthumus,</line>
<line>So soon as I can win th&#8217; offended King,</line>
<line>I will be known your advocate. Marry, yet</line>
<line>The fire of rage is in him, and &#8217;twere good</line>
<line>You lean&#8217;d unto his sentence with what patience</line>
<line>Your wisdom may inform you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POST.</speaker>
<line offset="7">Please your Highness,</line>
<line>I will from hence today.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>QUEEN.</speaker>
<line offset="5">You know the peril,</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll fetch a turn about the garden, pitying</line>
<line>The pangs of barr&#8217;d affections, though the King</line>
<line>Hath charg&#8217;d you should not speak together.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>IMO.</speaker>
<line offset="9">O</line>
<line>Dissembling courtesy! How fine this tyrant</line>
<line>Can tickle where she wounds! My dearest husband,</line>
<line>I something fear my father&#8217;s wrath, but nothing</line>
<line>(Always reserv&#8217;d my holy duty) what</line>
<line>His rage can do on me. You must be gone,</line>
<line>And I shall here abide the hourly shot</line>
<line>Of angry eyes, not comforted to live,</line>
<line>But that there is this jewel in the world</line>
<line>That I may see again.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POST.</speaker>
<line offset="4">My queen, my mistress!</line>
<line>O lady, weep no more, lest I give cause</line>
<line>To be suspected of more tenderness</line>
<line>Than doth become a man. I will remain</line>
<line>The loyall&#8217;st husband that did e&#8217;er plight troth.</line>
<line>My residence in Rome at one Philario&#8217;s,</line>
<line>Who to my father was a friend, to me</line>
<line>Known but by letter; thither write, my queen,</line>
<line>And with mine eyes I&#8217;ll drink the words you send,</line>
<line>Though ink be made of gall.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Queen.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>QUEEN.</speaker>
<line offset="6">Be brief, I pray you.</line>
<line>If the King come, I shall incur I know not</line>
<line>How much of his displeasure.</line>

<stagedir>Aside.</stagedir>
<line offset="6">Yet I&#8217;ll move him</line>
<line>To walk this way. I never do him wrong</line>
<line>But he does buy my injuries, to be friends;</line>
<line>Pays dear for my offenses.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>POST.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Should we be taking leave</line>
<line>As long a term as yet we have to live,</line>
<line>The loathness to depart would grow. <french xml:lang="fr">Adieu</french>!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IMO.</speaker>
<line>Nay, stay a little:</line>
<line>Were you but riding forth to air yourself,</line>
<line>Such parting were too petty. Look here, love,</line>
<line>This diamond was my mother&#8217;s. Take it, heart,</line>
<line>But keep it till you woo another wife,</line>
<line>When Imogen is dead.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POST.</speaker>
<line offset="4">How, how? Another?</line>
<line>You gentle gods, give me but this I have,</line>
<line>And cere up my embracements from a next</line>
<line>With bonds of death!</line>

<stagedir>Puts on the ring.</stagedir>
<line>Remain, remain thou here,</line>
<line>While sense can keep it on. And, sweetest, fairest,</line>
<line>As I my poor self did exchange for you,</line>
<line>To your so infinite loss, so in our trifles</line>
<line>I still win of you. For my sake wear this:</line>
<line>It is a manacle of love, I&#8217;ll place it</line>
<line>Upon this fairest prisoner.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Putting a bracelet upon her arm.</stagedir>

<line offset="5">O the gods!</line>
<line>When shall we see again?</line>

<stagedir>Enter Cymbeline and Lords.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>POST.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Alack, the King!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CYM.</speaker>
<line>Thou basest thing, avoid hence, from my sight!</line>
<line>If after this command thou fraught the court</line>
<line>With thy unworthiness, thou diest. Away!</line>
<line>Thou&#8217;rt poison to my blood.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POST.</speaker>
<line offset="5">The gods protect you,</line>
<line>And bless the good remainders of the court!</line>
<line>I am gone.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>IMO.</speaker>
<line offset="3">There cannot be a pinch in death</line>
<line>More sharp than this is.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CYM.</speaker>
<line offset="5">O disloyal thing,</line>
<line>That shouldst repair my youth, thou heap&#8217;st</line>
<line>A year&#8217;s age on me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IMO.</speaker>
<line offset="4">I beseech you, sir,</line>
<line>Harm not yourself with your vexation,</line>
<line>I am senseless of your wrath; a touch more rare</line>
<line>Subdues all pangs, all fears.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CYM.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Past grace? Obedience?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IMO.</speaker>
<line>Past hope, and in despair, that way past grace.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CYM.</speaker>
<line>That mightst have had the sole son of my queen!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IMO.</speaker>
<line>O blessed, that I might not! I chose an eagle,</line>
<line>And did avoid a puttock.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CYM.</speaker>
<line>Thou took&#8217;st a beggar, wouldst have made my throne</line>
<line>A seat for baseness.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IMO.</speaker>
<line offset="4">No, I rather added</line>
<line>A lustre to it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CYM.</speaker>
<line offset="3">O thou vild one!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IMO.</speaker>
<line offset="7">Sir,</line>
<line>It is your fault that I have lov&#8217;d Posthumus:</line>
<line>You bred him as my playfellow, and he is</line>
<line>A man worth any woman; overbuys me</line>
<line>Almost the sum he pays.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CYM.</speaker>
<line offset="5">What? Art thou mad?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IMO.</speaker>
<line>Almost, sir: heaven restore me! Would I were</line>
<line>A neat-herd&#8217;s daughter, and my Leonatus</line>
<line>Our neighbor shepherd&#8217;s son!</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Queen.</stagedir>

<speaker>CYM.</speaker>
<line offset="7">Thou foolish thing!</line>

<stagedir>To the Queen.</stagedir>
<line>They were again together; you have done</line>
<line>Not after our command. Away with her,</line>
<line>And pen her up.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>QUEEN.</speaker>
<line offset="3">Beseech your patience. Peace,</line>
<line>Dear lady daughter, peace! Sweet sovereign,</line>
<line>Leave us to ourselves, and make yourself some comfort</line>
<line>Out of your best advice.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CYM.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Nay, let her languish</line>
<line>A drop of blood a day, and being aged</line>
<line>Die of this folly!</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit with Lords.</stagedir>

<stagedir>Enter Pisanio.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>QUEEN.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Fie, you must give way.</line>
<line>Here is your servant. How now, sir? What news?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PIS.</speaker>
<line>My lord your son drew on my master.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>QUEEN.</speaker>
<line offset="8">Hah?</line>
<line>No harm, I trust, is done?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PIS.</speaker>
<line offset="5">There might have been,</line>
<line>But that my master rather play&#8217;d than fought</line>
<line>And had no help of anger. They were parted</line>
<line>By gentlemen at hand.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>QUEEN.</speaker>
<line offset="4">I am very glad on&#8217;t.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IMO.</speaker>
<line>Your son&#8217;s my father&#8217;s friend, he takes his part</line>
<line>To draw upon an exile. O brave sir!</line>
<line>I would they were in Afric both together,</line>
<line>Myself by with a needle, that I might prick</line>
<line>The goer-back. Why came you from your master?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PIS.</speaker>
<line>On his command. He would not suffer me</line>
<line>To bring him to the haven; left these notes</line>
<line>Of what commands I should be subject to,</line>
<line>When&#8217;t pleas&#8217;d you to employ me.</line>

<stagedir>Enter Cloten and two Lords.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>1. LORD.</speaker>
<line>Sir, I would advise you to shift a shirt; the violence of action hath made you reek as a sacrifice. Where air comes out, air comes in; there&#8217;s none abroad so wholesome as that you vent.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CLO.</speaker>
<line>If my shirt were bloody, then to shift it. Have I hurt him?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. LORD</speaker>
<stagedir>Aside.</stagedir>
<line> No, faith; not so much as his patience.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. LORD.</speaker>
<line>Hurt him? His body&#8217;s a passable carcass, if he be not hurt; it is a throughfare for steel, if it be not hurt.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. LORD</speaker>
<stagedir>Aside.</stagedir>
<line> His steel was in debt, it went o&#8217; th&#8217; backside the town.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CLO.</speaker>
<line>The villain would not stand me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. LORD</speaker>
<stagedir>Aside.</stagedir>
<line> No, but he fled forward still, toward your face.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. LORD.</speaker>
<line>Stand you? You have land enough of your own, but he added to your having, gave you some ground.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. LORD</speaker>
<stagedir>Aside.</stagedir>
<line> As many inches as you have oceans. Puppies!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CLO.</speaker>
<line>I would they had not come between us.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. LORD</speaker>
<stagedir>Aside.</stagedir>
<line>So would I, till you had measur&#8217;d how long a fool you were upon the ground.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CLO.</speaker>
<line>And that she should love this fellow, and refuse me!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. LORD</speaker>
<stagedir>Aside.</stagedir>
<line> If it be a sin to make a true election, she is damn&#8217;d.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. LORD.</speaker>
<line>Sir, as I told you always; her beauty and her brain go not together. She&#8217;s a good sign, but I have seen small reflection of her wit.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. LORD</speaker>
<stagedir>Aside.</stagedir>
<line> She shines not upon fools, lest the reflection should hurt her.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CLO.</speaker>
<line>Come, I&#8217;ll to my chamber. Would there had been some hurt done!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. LORD</speaker>
<stagedir>Aside.</stagedir>
<line>I wish not so, unless it had been the fall of an ass, which is no great hurt.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CLO.</speaker>
<line>You&#8217;ll go with us?</line>

<speech>
<speaker>IMO.</speaker>
<line>I would thou grew&#8217;st unto the shores o&#8217; th&#8217; haven,</line>
<line>And questionedst every sail. If he should write</line>
<line>And I not have it, &#8217;twere a paper lost</line>
<line>As offer&#8217;d mercy is. What was the last</line>
<line>That he spake to thee?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PIS.</speaker>
<line offset="4">It was his queen, his queen!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IMO.</speaker>
<line>Then wav&#8217;d his handkerchief?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PIS.</speaker>
<line offset="6">And kiss&#8217;d it, madam.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>PIS.</speaker>
<line offset="4">No, madam; for so long</line>
<line>As he could make me with this eye or ear</line>
<line>Distinguish him from others, he did keep</line>
<line>The deck, with glove or hat or handkerchief</line>
<line>Still waving, as the fits and stirs of &#8217;s mind</line>
<line>Could best express how slow his soul sail&#8217;d on,</line>
<line>How swift his ship.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IMO.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Thou shouldst have made him</line>

<speech>

<line>I would have broke mine eye-strings, crack&#8217;d them, but</line>
<line>To look upon him, till the diminution</line>
<line>Of space had pointed him sharp as my needle;</line>
<line>Nay, followed him till he had melted from</line>
<line>The smallness of a gnat to air, and then</line>
<line>Have turn&#8217;d mine eye and wept. But, good Pisanio,</line>
<line>When shall we hear from him?</line>

<speech>
<speaker>PIS.</speaker>
<line offset="6">Be assur&#8217;d, madam,</line>
<line>With his next vantage.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IMO.</speaker>
<line>I did not take my leave of him, but had</line>
<line>Most pretty things to say. Ere I could tell him</line>
<line>How I would think on him at certain hours</line>
<line>Such thoughts and such; or I could make him swear</line>
<line>The shes of Italy should not betray</line>
<line>Mine interest and his honor; or have charg&#8217;d him,</line>
<line>At the sixt hour of morn, at noon, at midnight,</line>
<line>T&#8217; encounter me with orisons, for then</line>
<line>I am in heaven for him; or ere I could</line>
<line>Give him that parting kiss which I had set</line>
<line>Betwixt two charming words, comes in my father,</line>
<line>And like the tyrannous breathing of the north</line>
<line>Shakes all our buds from growing.</line>

<stagedir>Enter Philario, Jachimo, a Frenchman, a Dutchman, and a Spaniard.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>JACH.</speaker>
<line>Believe it, sir, I have seen him in Britain. He was then of a crescent note, expected to prove so worthy as since he hath been allow&#8217;d the name of. But I could then have look&#8217;d on him without the help of admiration, though the catalogue of his endowments had been tabled by his side, and I to peruse him by items.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PHI.</speaker>
<line>You speak of him when he was less furnish&#8217;d than now he is with that which makes him both without and within.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FRENCH.</speaker>
<line>I have seen him in France. We had very many there could behold the sun with as firm eyes as he.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JACH.</speaker>
<line>This matter of marrying his king&#8217;s daughter, wherein he must be weigh&#8217;d rather by her value than his own, words him, I doubt not, a great deal from the matter.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FRENCH.</speaker>
<line>And then his banishment.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JACH.</speaker>
<line>Ay, and the approbation of those that weep this lamentable divorce under her colors are wonderfully to extend him, be it but to fortify her judgment, which else an easy battery might lay flat, for taking a beggar without less quality. But how comes it he is to sojourn with you? How creeps acquaintance?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PHI.</speaker>
<line>His father and I were soldiers together, to whom I have been often bound for no less than my life.</line>

<stagedir>Enter Posthumus.</stagedir>
<line>Here comes the Britain. Let him be so entertain&#8217;d amongst you as suits with gentlemen of your knowing to a stranger of his quality. I beseech you all be better known to this gentleman, whom I commend to you as a noble friend of mine. How worthy he is I will leave to appear hereafter, rather than story him in his own hearing.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FRENCH.</speaker>
<line>Sir, we have known together in Orleance.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POST.</speaker>
<line>Since when I have been debtor to you for courtesies, which I will be ever to pay and yet pay still.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FRENCH.</speaker>
<line>Sir, you o&#8217;errate my poor kindness, I was glad I did atone my countryman and you. It had been pity you should have been put together, with so mortal a purpose as then each bore, upon importance of so slight and trivial a nature.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POST.</speaker>
<line>By your pardon, sir, I was then a young traveller, rather shunn&#8217;d to go even with what I heard than in my every action to be guided by others&#8217; experiences: but upon my mended judgment (if I offend not to say it is mended) my quarrel was not altogether slight.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FRENCH.</speaker>
<line>Faith, yes, to be put to the arbiterment of swords, and by such two that would by all likelihood have confounded one the other, or have fall&#8217;n both.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JACH.</speaker>
<line>Can we, with manners, ask what was the difference?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FRENCH.</speaker>
<line>Safely, I think; &#8217;twas a contention in public, which may, without contradiction, suffer the report. It was much like an argument that fell out last night, where each of us fell in praise of our country mistresses; this gentleman at that time vouching (and upon warrant of bloody affirmation) his to be more fair, virtuous, wise, chaste, constant, qualified, and less attemptable than any the rarest of our ladies in France.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JACH.</speaker>
<line>That lady is not now living; or this gentleman&#8217;s opinion by this worn out.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POST.</speaker>
<line>She holds her virtue still, and I my mind.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JACH.</speaker>
<line>You must not so far prefer her &#8217;fore ours of Italy.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POST.</speaker>
<line>Being so far provok&#8217;d as I was in France, I would abate her nothing, though I profess myself her adorer, not her friend.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JACH.</speaker>
<line>As fair and as good&#8212;a kind of hand-in-hand comparison&#8212;had been something too fair and too good for any lady in Brittany. If she went before others I have seen, as that diamond of yours outlustres many I have beheld, I could not but believe she excell&#8217;d many. But I have not seen the most precious diamond that is, nor you the lady.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POST.</speaker>
<line>I prais&#8217;d her as I rated her: so do I my stone.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JACH.</speaker>
<line>What do you esteem it at?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POST.</speaker>
<line>More than the world enjoys.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JACH.</speaker>
<line>Either your unparagon&#8217;d mistress is dead, or she&#8217;s outpriz&#8217;d by a trifle.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POST.</speaker>
<line>You are mistaken: the one may be sold or given, or if there were wealth enough for the purchase, or merit for the gift; the other is not a thing for sale, and only the gift of the gods.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JACH.</speaker>
<line>Which the gods have given you?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POST.</speaker>
<line>Which, by their graces, I will keep.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JACH.</speaker>
<line>You may wear her in title yours; but you know strange fowl light upon neighboring ponds. Your ring may be stol&#8217;n too: so your brace of unprizable estimations, the one is but frail and the other casual. A cunning thief, or a (that way) accomplish&#8217;d courtier, would hazard the winning both of first and last.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POST.</speaker>
<line>Your Italy contains none so accomplish&#8217;d a courtier to convince the honor of my mistress, if in the holding or loss of that you term her frail. I do nothing doubt you have store of thieves; notwithstanding, I fear not my ring.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PHI.</speaker>
<line>Let us leave here, gentlemen.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POST.</speaker>
<line>Sir, with all my heart. This worthy signior, I thank him, makes no stranger of me: we are familiar at first.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JACH.</speaker>
<line>With five times so much conversation, I should get ground of your fair mistress; make her go back, even to the yielding, had I admittance, and opportunity to friend.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POST.</speaker>
<line>No, no.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JACH.</speaker>
<line>I dare thereupon pawn the moi&#8217;ty of my estate to your ring, which in my opinion o&#8217;ervalues it something. But I make my wager rather against your confidence than her reputation; and to bar your offense herein too, I durst attempt it against any lady in the world.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POST.</speaker>
<line>You are a great deal abus&#8217;d in too bold a persuasion, and I doubt not you sustain what y&#8217; are worthy of by your attempt.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JACH.</speaker>
<line>What&#8217;s that?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POST.</speaker>
<line>A repulse, though your attempt (as you call it) deserve more&#8212;a punishment too.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PHI.</speaker>
<line>Gentlemen, enough of this. It came in too suddenly, let it die as it was born, and I pray you be better acquainted.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JACH.</speaker>
<line>Would I had put my estate and my neighbor&#8217;s on th&#8217; approbation of what I have spoke!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POST.</speaker>
<line>What lady would you choose to assail?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JACH.</speaker>
<line>Yours, whom in constancy you think stands so safe. I will lay you ten thousand ducats to your ring, that, commend me to the court where your lady is, with no more advantage than the opportunity of a second conference, and I will bring from thence that honor of hers which you imagine so reserv&#8217;d.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POST.</speaker>
<line>I will wage against your gold, gold to it. My ring I hold dear as my finger, &#8217;tis part of it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JACH.</speaker>
<line>You are a friend, and therein the wiser. If you buy ladies&#8217; flesh at a million a dram, you cannot preserve it from tainting. But I see you have some religion in you, that you fear.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POST.</speaker>
<line>This is but a custom in your tongue; you bear a graver purpose, I hope.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JACH.</speaker>
<line>I am the master of my speeches, and would undergo what&#8217;s spoken, I swear.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POST.</speaker>
<line>Will you? I shall but lend my diamond till your return. Let there be covenants drawn between &#8217;s. My mistress exceeds in goodness the hugeness of your unworthy thinking. I dare you to this match: here&#8217;s my ring.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PHI.</speaker>
<line>I will have it no lay.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JACH.</speaker>
<line>By the gods, it is one. If I bring you no sufficient testimony that I have enjoy&#8217;d the dearest bodily part of your mistress, my ten thousand ducats are yours, so is your diamond too. If I come off and leave her in such honor as you have trust in, she your jewel, this your jewel, and my gold are yours&#8212;provided I have your commendation for my more free entertainment.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POST.</speaker>
<line>I embrace these conditions, let us have articles betwixt us. Only, thus far you shall answer: if you make your voyage upon her and give me directly to understand you have prevail&#8217;d, I am no further your enemy; she is not worth our debate. If she remain unseduc&#8217;d, you not making it appear otherwise, for your ill opinion and th&#8217; assault you have made to her chastity, you shall answer me with your sword.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JACH.</speaker>
<line>Your hand&#8212;a covenant. We will have these things set down by lawful counsel, and straight away for Britain, lest the bargain should catch cold and starve. I will fetch my gold and have our two wagers recorded.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POST.</speaker>
<line>Agreed.</line>

<stagedir>Enter Queen, Ladies, and Cornelius.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>QUEEN.</speaker>
<line>Whiles yet the dew&#8217;s on ground, gather those flowers;</line>
<line>Make haste. Who has the note of them?</line>

<stagedir>Exeunt Ladies.</stagedir>
<line>Now, master doctor, have you brought those drugs?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>COR.</speaker>
<line>Pleaseth your Highness, ay. Here they are, madam.</line>
<stagedir>Presenting a small box.</stagedir>
<line>But I beseech your Grace, without offense</line>
<line>(My conscience bids me ask), wherefore you have</line>
<line>Commanded of me these most poisonous compounds,</line>
<line>Which are the movers of a languishing death,</line>
<line>But though slow, deadly.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>QUEEN.</speaker>
<line offset="5">I wonder, doctor,</line>
<line>Thou ask&#8217;st me such a question. Have I not been</line>
<line>Thy pupil long? Hast thou not learn&#8217;d me how</line>
<line>To make perfumes? Distill? Preserve? Yea so,</line>
<line>That our great King himself doth woo me oft</line>
<line>For my confections? Having thus far proceeded</line>
<line>(Unless thou think&#8217;st me devilish) is&#8217;t not meet</line>
<line>That I did amplify my judgment in</line>
<line>Other conclusions? I will try the forces</line>
<line>Of these thy compounds on such creatures as</line>
<line>We count not worth the hanging (but none human),</line>
<line>To try the vigor of them, and apply</line>
<line>Allayments to their act, and by them gather</line>
<line>Their several virtues and effects.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>COR.</speaker>
<line offset="7">Your Highness</line>
<line>Shall from this practice but make hard your heart;</line>
<line>Besides, the seeing these effects will be</line>
<line>Both noisome and infectious.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>QUEEN.</speaker>
<line offset="6">O, content thee.</line>
<stagedir>Enter Pisanio.</stagedir>
<stagedir>Aside.</stagedir>
<line>Here comes a flattering rascal, upon him</line>
<line>Will I first work. He&#8217;s for his master,</line>
<line>And enemy to my son.&#8212;How now, Pisanio?</line>
<line>Doctor, your service for this time is ended,</line>
<line>Take your own way.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>COR.</speaker>
<stagedir>Aside.</stagedir>
<line offset="4">I do suspect you, madam,</line>

<stagedir>To Pisanio.</stagedir>
<line offset="5">Hark thee, a word.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>COR.</speaker>
<stagedir>Aside.</stagedir>
<line>I do not like her. She doth think she has</line>
<line>Strange ling&#8217;ring poisons. I do know her spirit,</line>
<line>And will not trust one of her malice with</line>
<line>A drug of such damn&#8217;d nature. Those she has</line>
<line>Will stupefy and dull the sense awhile,</line>
<line>Which first (perchance) she&#8217;ll prove on cats and dogs,</line>
<line>Then afterward up higher; but there is</line>
<line>No danger in what show of death it makes,</line>
<line>More than the locking up the spirits a time,</line>
<line>To be more fresh, reviving. She is fool&#8217;d</line>
<line>With a most false effect; and I the truer,</line>
<line>So to be false with her.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>QUEEN.</speaker>
<line offset="4">No further service, doctor,</line>
<line>Until I send for thee.</line>

<line offset="4">I humbly take my leave.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>QUEEN.</speaker>
<line>Weeps she still, say&#8217;st thou? Dost thou think in time</line>
<line>She will not quench, and let instructions enter</line>
<line>Where folly now possesses? Do thou work.</line>
<line>When thou shalt bring me word she loves my son,</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll tell thee on the instant thou art then</line>
<line>As great as is thy master&#8212;greater, for</line>
<line>His fortunes all lie speechless, and his name</line>
<line>Is at last gasp. Return he cannot, nor</line>
<line>Continue where he is. To shift his being</line>
<line>Is to exchange one misery with another,</line>
<line>And every day that comes comes to decay</line>
<line>A day&#8217;s work in him. What shalt thou expect</line>
<line>To be depender on a thing that leans?</line>
<line>Who cannot be new built, nor has no friends</line>
<line>So much as but to prop him?</line>

<stagedir>The Queen drops the box; Pisanio takes it up.</stagedir>
<line offset="6">Thou tak&#8217;st up</line>
<line>Thou know&#8217;st not what; but take it for thy labor.</line>
<line>It is a thing I made, which hath the King</line>
<line>Five times redeem&#8217;d from death. I do not know</line>
<line>What is more cordial. Nay, I prithee take it,</line>
<line>It is an earnest of a farther good</line>
<line>That I mean to thee. Tell thy mistress how</line>
<line>The case stands with her; do&#8217;t as from thyself.</line>
<line>Think what a chance thou changest on, but think</line>
<line>Thou hast thy mistress still; to boot, my son,</line>
<line>Who shall take notice of thee. I&#8217;ll move the King</line>
<line>To any shape of thy preferment, such</line>
<line>As thou&#8217;lt desire; and then myself, I chiefly,</line>
<line>That set thee on to this desert, am bound</line>

<line>Think on my words.</line>

<stagedir>Exit Pisanio.</stagedir>
<line offset="4">A sly and constant knave,</line>
<line>Not to be shak&#8217;d; the agent for his master,</line>

<line>Is there no way for men to be, but women</line>

<line>Did call my father, was I know not where</line>
<line>When I was stamp&#8217;d. Some coiner with his tools</line>
<line>Made me a counterfeit; yet my mother seem&#8217;d</line>

<line>Me of my lawful pleasure she restrain&#8217;d,</line>

<line>The woman&#8217;s part in me&#8212;for there&#8217;s no motion</line>
<line>That tends to vice in man, but I affirm</line>
<line>It is the woman&#8217;s part: be it lying, note it,</line>

<line>Lust and rank thoughts, hers, hers; revenges, hers;</line>
<line>Ambitions, covetings, change of prides, disdain,</line>

<line>All faults that name, nay, that hell knows,</line>
<line>Why, hers, in part or all; but rather, all;</line>
<line>For even to vice</line>
<line>They are not constant, but are changing still:</line>
<line>One vice but of a minute old, for one</line>
<line>Not half so old as that. I&#8217;ll write against them,</line>

<line>Come, there&#8217;s no more tribute to be paid. Our kingdom is stronger than it was at that time; and (as I said) there is no more such Caesars. Other of them may have crook&#8217;d noses, but to owe such straight arms, none.</line>

<line>We have yet many among us can gripe as hard as Cassibelan. I do not say I am one; but I have a hand. Why tribute? Why should we pay tribute?

<line>Did put the yoke upon &#8217;s; which to shake off</line>
<line>Becomes a warlike people, whom we reckon</line>
<line>Ourselves to be. We do say then to Caesar,</line>
<line>Our ancestor was that Mulmutius which</line>
<line>Ordain&#8217;d our laws, whose use the sword of Caesar</line>
<line>Hath too much mangled, whose repair and franchise</line>
<line>Shall (by the power we hold) be our good deed,</line>

That part thou, Pisanio, must act for me, if thy faith be not tainted with the breach of hers. Let thine own hands take away her life. I shall give thee opportunity at Milford-Haven.

<line>What shall I need to draw my sword, the paper</line>

<line>Whose edge is sharper than the sword, whose tongue</line>
<line>Outvenoms all the worms of Nile, whose breath</line>
<line>Rides on the posting winds and doth belie</line>
<line>All corners of the world. Kings, queens, and states,</line>

<line>This viperous slander enters. What cheer, madam?</line>

<line>False to his bed? What is it to be false?</line>
<line>To lie in watch there, and to think on him?</line>
<line>To weep &#8217;twixt clock and clock? If sleep charge nature,</line>

<line>I false? Thy conscience witness! Jachimo,</line>
<line>Thou didst accuse him of incontinency;</line>
<line>Thou then look&#8217;dst like a villain; now methinks</line>
<line>Thy favor&#8217;s good enough. Some jay of Italy</line>
<line>(Whose mother was her painting) hath betray&#8217;d him.</line>
<line>Poor I am stale, a garment out of fashion,</line>
<line>And for I am richer than to hang by th&#8217; walls,</line>
<line>I must be ripp&#8217;d. To pieces with me! O!</line>
<line>Men&#8217;s vows are women&#8217;s traitors. All good seeming,</line>

<line>Wilt lay the leaven on all proper men;</line>
<line>Goodly and gallant shall be false and perjur&#8217;d</line>
<line>From thy great fail.&#8212;Come, fellow, be thou honest,</line>
<line>Do thou thy master&#8217;s bidding. When thou seest him,</line>
<line>A little witness my obedience. Look</line>
<line>I draw the sword myself, take it, and hit</line>
<line>The innocent mansion of my love, my heart.</line>
<line>Fear not, &#8217;tis empty of all things but grief.</line>
<line>Thy master is not there, who was indeed</line>

<line>My father, and make me put into contempt the suits</line>
<line>Of princely fellows, shalt hereafter find</line>
<line>It is no act of common passage, but</line>

<line>To think, when thou shalt be disedg&#8217;d by her</line>

<line>The time inviting thee? The perturb&#8217;d court</line>

<line>Alack, no remedy!) to the greedy touch</line>

<line>Meet thee at Milford-Haven! (I forgot to ask him one thing, I&#8217;ll remember&#8217;t anon.) Even there, thou villain Posthumus, will I kill thee. I would these garments were come. She said upon a time (the bitterness of it I now belch from my heart) that she held the very garment of Posthumus in more respect than my noble and natural person, together with the adornment of my qualities. With that suit upon my back will I ravish her; first kill him, and in her eyes; there shall she see my valor, which will then be a torment to her contempt. He on the ground, my speech of insultment ended on his dead body, and when my lust hath din&#8217;d (which, as I say, to vex her I will execute in the clothes that she so prais&#8217;d), to the court I&#8217;ll knock her back, foot her home again.

Therein I must play the workman. I dare speak it to myself, for it is not vainglory for a man and his glass to confer in his own chamber&#8212;I mean, the lines of my body are as well drawn as his; no less young, more strong, not beneath him in fortunes, beyond him in the advantage of the time, above him in birth, alike conversant in general services, and more remarkable in single oppositions; yet this imperceiverant thing loves him in my despite. What mortality is! Posthumus, thy head, which now is growing upon thy shoulders, shall within this hour be off, thy mistress enforc&#8217;d, thy garments cut to pieces before her face: and all this done, spurn her home to her father, who may (happily) be a little angry for my so rough usage; but my mother, having power of his testiness, shall turn all into my commendations. My horse is tied up safe; out, sword, and to a sore purpose! Fortune put them into my hand! This is the very description of their meeting-place, and the fellow dares not deceive me.</line>

<line>Pisanio might have kill&#8217;d thee at the heart</line>

<line>Most welcome, bondage! For thou art a way,</line>
<line>I think, to liberty; yet am I better</line>

<line>Groan so in perpetuity than be cur&#8217;d</line>
<line>By th&#8217; sure physician, death, who is the key</line>
<line>T&#8217; unbar these locks. My conscience, thou art fetter&#8217;d</line>
<line>More than my shanks and wrists. You good gods, give me</line>
<line>The penitent instrument to pick that bolt,</line>
<line>Then free forever! Is&#8217;t enough I am sorry?</line>
<line>So children temporal fathers do appease;</line>
<line>Gods are more full of mercy. Must I repent,</line>
<line>I cannot do it better than in gyves,</line>
<line>Desir&#8217;d more than constrain&#8217;d. To satisfy,</line>
<line>If of my freedom &#8217;tis the main part, take</line>

<line>I know you are more clement than vild men,</line>

<line>&#8217;Tis not so dear, yet &#8217;tis a life; you coin&#8217;d it.</line>
<line>&#8217;Tween man and man they weigh not every stamp;</line>
<line>Though light, take pieces for the figure&#8217;s sake;</line>
<line>You rather, mine being yours; and so, great pow&#8217;rs,</line>
<line>If you will take this audit, take this life,</line>
<line>And cancel these cold bonds. O Imogen,</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll speak to thee in silence.</line>

Then, after other music, follows the two young Leonati, brothers to Posthumus, with wounds as they died in the wars. They circle Posthumus round as he lies sleeping.</stagedir>

<line>A heavy reckoning for you, sir. But the comfort is, you shall be call&#8217;d to no more payments, fear no more tavern-bills, which are often the sadness of parting, as the procuring of mirth. You come in faint for want of meat, depart reeling with too much drink; sorry that you have paid too much, and sorry that you are paid too much; purse and brain both empty; the brain the heavier for being too light, the purse too light, being drawn of heaviness. O, of this contradiction you shall now be quit. O, the charity of a penny cord! It sums up thousands in a trice. You have no true debitor and creditor but it: of what&#8217;s past, is, and to come, the discharge. Your neck, sir, is pen, book, and counters; so the acquittance follows.</line>

<line>The service that you three have done is more</line>
<line>Unlike than this thou tell&#8217;st. I lost my children;</line>
<line>If these be they, I know not how to wish</line>
<line>A pair of worthier sons.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>BEL.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Be pleas&#8217;d awhile:</line>
<line>This gentleman, whom I call Polydore,</line>
<line>Most worthy prince, as yours, is true Guiderius;</line>
<line>This gentleman, my Cadwal, Arviragus,</line>
<line>Your younger princely son. He, sir, was lapp&#8217;d</line>
<line>In a most curious mantle, wrought by th&#8217; hand</line>
<line>Of his queen mother, which for more probation</line>
<line>I can with ease produce.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CYM.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Guiderius had</line>
<line>Upon his neck a mole, a sanguine star,</line>
<line>It was a mark of wonder.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BEL.</speaker>
<line offset="5">This is he,</line>
<line>Who hath upon him still that natural stamp.</line>
<line>It was wise nature&#8217;s end in the donation,</line>
<line>To be his evidence now.</line>
</speech>

<speaker>CYM.</speaker>
<line offset="5">O, what, am I</line>
<line>A mother to the birth of three? Ne&#8217;er mother</line>
<line>Rejoic&#8217;d deliverance more. Blest pray you be,</line>
<line>That after this strange starting from your orbs,</line>
<line>You may reign in them now! O Imogen,</line>
<line>Thou hast lost by this a kingdom.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IMO.</speaker>
<line offset="7">No, my lord;</line>
<line>I have got two worlds by&#8217;t. O my gentle brothers,</line>
<line>Have we thus met? O, never say hereafter</line>
<line>But I am truest speaker. You call&#8217;d me brother,</line>
<line>When I was but your sister; I you brothers,</line>
<line>When we were so indeed.</line>
</speech>

<speaker>CYM.</speaker>

<speech>
<speaker>ARV.</speaker>
<line>Ay, my good lord.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GUI.</speaker>
<line offset="4">And at first meeting lov&#8217;d,</line>

<speech>
<speaker>CYM.</speaker>
<line offset="8">O rare instinct!</line>
<line>When shall I hear all through? This fierce abridgment</line>
<line>Hath to it circumstantial branches, which</line>
<line>Distinction should be rich in. Where? How liv&#8217;d you?</line>
<line>And when came you to serve our Roman captive?</line>
<line>How parted with your brothers? How first met them?</line>
<line>Why fled you from the court? And whither? These,</line>
<line>And your three motives to the battle, with</line>
<line>I know not how much more, should be demanded,</line>
<line>And all the other by-dependances,</line>
<line>From chance to chance; but nor the time nor place</line>
<line>Will serve our long interrogatories. See,</line>
<line>Posthumus anchors upon Imogen;</line>
<line>And she (like harmless lightning) throws her eye</line>
<line>On him, her brothers, me, her master, hitting</line>
<line>Each object with a joy; the counterchange</line>
<line>Is severally in all. Let&#8217;s quit this ground,</line>
<line>And smoke the temple with our sacrifices.</line>

<stagedir>To Belarius.</stagedir>
<line>Thou art my brother, so we&#8217;ll hold thee ever.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IMO.</speaker>
<line>You are my father too, and did relieve me</line>
<line>To see this gracious season.</line>

<speaker>CYM.</speaker>
<line offset="5">All o&#8217;erjoy&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Save these in bonds. Let them be joyful too,</line>

<line>The forlorn soldier, that so nobly fought,</line>

<line>The thankings of a king.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POST.</speaker>
<line offset="5">I am, sir,</line>
<line>The soldier that did company these three</line>
<line>In poor beseeming; &#8217;twas a fitment for</line>
<line>The purpose I then follow&#8217;d. That I was he,</line>
<line>Speak, Jachimo. I had you down and might</line>

<speaker>JACH.</speaker>
<stagedir>Kneeling.</stagedir>
<line offset="5">I am down again;</line>
<line>But now my heavy conscience sinks my knee,</line>
<line>As then your force did. Take that life, beseech you,</line>
<line>Which I so often owe; but your ring first,</line>
<line>And here the bracelet of the truest princess</line>
<line>That ever swore her faith.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POST.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Kneel not to me.</line>
<line>The pow&#8217;r that I have on you is to spare you;</line>

<line offset="5">Nobly doom&#8217;d!</line>
<line>We&#8217;ll learn our freeness of a son-in-law:</line>
<line>Pardon&#8217;s the word to all.</line>

<stagedir>To Posthumus.</stagedir>
<line offset="5">You holp us, sir,</line>

<line>Your servant, Princes. Good my lord of Rome,</line>
<line>Call forth your soothsayer. As I slept, methought</line>
<line>Great Jupiter, upon his eagle back&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Appear&#8217;d to me, with other spritely shows</line>
<line>Of mine own kindred. When I wak&#8217;d, I found</line>
<line>This label on my bosom, whose containing</line>
<line>Is so from sense in hardness, that I can</line>
<line>Make no collection of it. Let him show</line>
<line>His skill in the construction.</line>

<line>Here, my good lord.</line>

<line offset="4">Read, and declare the meaning.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PHIL.</speaker>
<stagedir>Reads.</stagedir>
<line><RECITE>&#8220;When as a lion&#8217;s whelp shall, to himself unknown, without seeking find, and be embrac&#8217;d by a piece of tender air; and when from a stately cedar shall be lopp&#8217;d branches, which, being dead many years, shall after revive, be jointed to the old stock, and freshly grow; then shall Posthumus end his miseries, Britain be fortunate and flourish in peace and plenty.&#8221;</RECITE></line>
<line>Thou, Leonatus, art the lion&#8217;s whelp;</line>
<line>The fit and apt construction of thy name,</line>
<line>Being Leo-natus, doth import so much.</line>

<stagedir>To Cymbeline</stagedir>
<line>The piece of tender air, thy virtuous daughter,</line>
<line>Which we call <latin xml:lang="la">mollis aer</latin>, and <latin xml:lang="la">mollis aer</latin></line>
<line>We term it mulier;</line>

<stagedir>To Posthumus</stagedir>
<line offset="4">which mulier I divine</line>
<line>Is this most constant wife, who, even now,</line>
<line>Answering the letter of the oracle,</line>
<line>Unknown to you, unsought, were clipt about</line>
<line>With this most tender air.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CYM.</speaker>
<line offset="5">This hath some seeming.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PHIL.</speaker>
<line>The lofty cedar, royal Cymbeline,</line>
<line>Personates thee; and thy lopp&#8217;d branches point</line>
<line>Thy two sons forth; who, by Belarius stol&#8217;n,</line>
<line>For many years thought dead, are now reviv&#8217;d,</line>
<line>To the majestic cedar join&#8217;d, whose issue</line>
<line>Promises Britain peace and plenty.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CYM.</speaker>
<line offset="7">Well,</line>
<line>My peace we will begin. And, Caius Lucius,</line>
<line>Although the victor, we submit to Caesar,</line>
<line>And to the Roman empire, promising</line>
<line>To pay our wonted tribute, from the which</line>
<line>We were dissuaded by our wicked queen,</line>
<line>Whom heavens, in justice both on her and hers,</line>
<line>Have laid most heavy hand.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PHIL.</speaker>
<line>The fingers of the pow&#8217;rs above do tune</line>
<line>The harmony of this peace. The vision</line>
<line>Which I made known to Lucius, ere the stroke</line>
<line>Of yet this scarce-cold battle, at this instant</line>
<line>Is full accomplish&#8217;d: for the Roman eagle,</line>
<line>From south to west on wing soaring aloft,</line>
<line>Lessen&#8217;d herself, and in the beams o&#8217; th&#8217; sun</line>
<line>So vanish&#8217;d; which foreshow&#8217;d our princely eagle,</line>
<line>Th&#8217; imperial Caesar, should again unite</line>
<line>His favor with the radiant Cymbeline,</line>
<line>Which shines here in the west.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CYM.</speaker>
<line offset="6">Laud we the gods,</line>
<line>And let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrils</line>
<line>From our blest altars. Publish we this peace</line>
<line>To all our subjects. Set we forward. Let</line>
<line>A Roman and a British ensign wave</line>
<line>Friendly together. So through Lud&#8217;s-Town march,</line>
<line>And in the temple of great Jupiter</line>
<line>Our peace we&#8217;ll ratify; seal it with feasts.</line>
<line>Set on there! Never was a war did cease</line>
<line>(Ere bloody hands were wash&#8217;d) with such a peace.</line>
