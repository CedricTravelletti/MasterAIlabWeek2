<SCENEPERSONAE>(Gentlemen, Queen, Posthumus, Imogen, Cymbeline, Lords, Pisanio)</SCENEPERSONAE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter two Gentlemen.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. GENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You do not meet a man but frowns. Our bloods</LINE>
<LINE>No more obey the heavens than our courtiers&#8217;</LINE>
<LINE>Still seem as does the King&#8217;s.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. GENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">But what&#8217;s the matter?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. GENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>His daughter, and the heir of &#8217;s kingdom (whom</LINE>
<LINE>He purpos&#8217;d to his wive&#8217;s sole son&#8212;a widow</LINE>
<LINE>That late he married), hath referr&#8217;d herself</LINE>
<LINE>Unto a poor but worthy gentleman. She&#8217;s wedded,</LINE>
<LINE>Her husband banish&#8217;d, she imprison&#8217;d: all</LINE>
<LINE>Is outward sorrow, though I think the King</LINE>
<LINE>Be touch&#8217;d at very heart.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. GENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">None but the King?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. GENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He that hath lost her too; so is the Queen,</LINE>
<LINE>That most desir&#8217;d the match. But not a courtier,</LINE>
<LINE>Although they wear their faces to the bent</LINE>
<LINE>Of the King&#8217;s looks, hath a heart that is not</LINE>
<LINE>Glad at the thing they scowl at.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. GENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">And why so?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. GENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He that hath miss&#8217;d the Princess is a thing</LINE>
<LINE>Too bad for bad report; and he that hath her</LINE>
<LINE>(I mean, that married her, alack, good man!</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore banish&#8217;d) is a creature such</LINE>
<LINE>As, to seek through the regions of the earth</LINE>
<LINE>For one his like, there would be something failing</LINE>
<LINE>In him that should compare. I do not think</LINE>
<LINE>So fair an outward and such stuff within</LINE>
<LINE>Endows a man but he.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. GENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">You speak him far.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. GENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do extend him, sir, within himself,</LINE>
<LINE>Crush him together rather than unfold</LINE>
<LINE>His measure duly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. GENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">What&#8217;s his name and birth?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. GENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I cannot delve him to the root: his father</LINE>
<LINE>Was call&#8217;d Sicilius, who did join his honor</LINE>
<LINE>Against the Romans with Cassibelan,</LINE>
<LINE>But had his titles by Tenantius, whom</LINE>
<LINE>He serv&#8217;d with glory and admir&#8217;d success:</LINE>
<LINE>So gain&#8217;d the sur-addition Leonatus;</LINE>
<LINE>And had (besides this gentleman in question)</LINE>
<LINE>Two other sons, who in the wars o&#8217; th&#8217; time</LINE>
<LINE>Died with their swords in hand; for which their father,</LINE>
<LINE>Then old and fond of issue, took such sorrow</LINE>
<LINE>That he quit being, and his gentle lady,</LINE>
<LINE>Big of this gentleman, our theme, deceas&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>As he was born. The King he takes the babe</LINE>
<LINE>To his protection, calls him Posthumus Leonatus,</LINE>
<LINE>Breeds him and makes him of his bedchamber,</LINE>
<LINE>Puts to him all the learnings that his time</LINE>
<LINE>Could make him the receiver of, which he took,</LINE>
<LINE>As we do air, fast as &#8217;twas minist&#8217;red,</LINE>
<LINE>And in &#8217;s spring became a harvest; liv&#8217;d in court</LINE>
<LINE>(Which rare it is to do) most prais&#8217;d, most lov&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>A sample to the youngest, to th&#8217; more mature</LINE>
<LINE>A glass that feated them, and to the graver</LINE>
<LINE>A child that guided dotards. To his mistress</LINE>
<LINE>(For whom he now is banish&#8217;d), her own price</LINE>
<LINE>Proclaims how she esteem&#8217;d him; and his virtue</LINE>
<LINE>By her election may be truly read,</LINE>
<LINE>What kind of man he is.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. GENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">I honor him</LINE>
<LINE>Even out of your report. But pray you tell me,</LINE>
<LINE>Is she sole child to th&#8217; King?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. GENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">His only child.</LINE>
<LINE>He had two sons (if this be worth your hearing,</LINE>
<LINE>Mark it), the eldest of them at three years old,</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217; th&#8217; swathing clothes the other, from their nursery</LINE>
<LINE>Were stol&#8217;n, and to this hour no guess in knowledge</LINE>
<LINE>Which way they went.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. GENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">How long is this ago?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. GENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Some twenty years.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. GENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That a king&#8217;s children should be so convey&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>So slackly guarded, and the search so slow,</LINE>
<LINE>That could not trace them!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. GENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Howsoe&#8217;er &#8217;tis strange,</LINE>
<LINE>Or that the negligence may well be laugh&#8217;d at,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet is it true, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. GENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="3">I do well believe you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. GENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We must forbear. Here comes the gentleman,</LINE>
<LINE>The Queen, and Princess.</LINE>
</SPEECH>
<STAGEDIR>Exeunt.</STAGEDIR>
<STAGEDIR>Enter the Queen, Posthumus, and Imogen.</STAGEDIR>


<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, be assur&#8217;d you shall not find me, daughter,</LINE>
<LINE>After the slander of most stepmothers,</LINE>
<LINE>Evil-ey&#8217;d unto you. You&#8217;re my prisoner, but</LINE>
<LINE>Your jailer shall deliver you the keys</LINE>
<LINE>That lock up your restraint. For you, Posthumus,</LINE>
<LINE>So soon as I can win th&#8217; offended King,</LINE>
<LINE>I will be known your advocate. Marry, yet</LINE>
<LINE>The fire of rage is in him, and &#8217;twere good</LINE>
<LINE>You lean&#8217;d unto his sentence with what patience</LINE>
<LINE>Your wisdom may inform you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">Please your Highness,</LINE>
<LINE>I will from hence today.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">You know the peril,</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll fetch a turn about the garden, pitying</LINE>
<LINE>The pangs of barr&#8217;d affections, though the King</LINE>
<LINE>Hath charg&#8217;d you should not speak together.</LINE>
</SPEECH>
<STAGEDIR>Exit.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="9">O</LINE>
<LINE>Dissembling courtesy! How fine this tyrant</LINE>
<LINE>Can tickle where she wounds! My dearest husband,</LINE>
<LINE>I something fear my father&#8217;s wrath, but nothing</LINE>
<LINE>(Always reserv&#8217;d my holy duty) what</LINE>
<LINE>His rage can do on me. You must be gone,</LINE>
<LINE>And I shall here abide the hourly shot</LINE>
<LINE>Of angry eyes, not comforted to live,</LINE>
<LINE>But that there is this jewel in the world</LINE>
<LINE>That I may see again.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">My queen, my mistress!</LINE>
<LINE>O lady, weep no more, lest I give cause</LINE>
<LINE>To be suspected of more tenderness</LINE>
<LINE>Than doth become a man. I will remain</LINE>
<LINE>The loyall&#8217;st husband that did e&#8217;er plight troth.</LINE>
<LINE>My residence in Rome at one Philario&#8217;s,</LINE>
<LINE>Who to my father was a friend, to me</LINE>
<LINE>Known but by letter; thither write, my queen,</LINE>
<LINE>And with mine eyes I&#8217;ll drink the words you send,</LINE>
<LINE>Though ink be made of gall.</LINE>
</SPEECH>
<STAGEDIR>Enter Queen.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">Be brief, I pray you.</LINE>
<LINE>If the King come, I shall incur I know not</LINE>
<LINE>How much of his displeasure.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Aside.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE offset="6">Yet I&#8217;ll move him</LINE>
<LINE>To walk this way. I never do him wrong</LINE>
<LINE>But he does buy my injuries, to be friends;</LINE>
<LINE>Pays dear for my offenses.</LINE>
</SPEECH>
<STAGEDIR>Exit.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Should we be taking leave</LINE>
<LINE>As long a term as yet we have to live,</LINE>
<LINE>The loathness to depart would grow. Adieu!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, stay a little:</LINE>
<LINE>Were you but riding forth to air yourself,</LINE>
<LINE>Such parting were too petty. Look here, love,</LINE>
<LINE>This diamond was my mother&#8217;s. Take it, heart,</LINE>
<LINE>But keep it till you woo another wife,</LINE>
<LINE>When Imogen is dead.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">How, how? Another?</LINE>
<LINE>You gentle gods, give me but this I have,</LINE>
<LINE>And cere up my embracements from a next</LINE>
<LINE>With bonds of death!</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Puts on the ring.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Remain, remain thou here,</LINE>
<LINE>While sense can keep it on. And, sweetest, fairest,</LINE>
<LINE>As I my poor self did exchange for you,</LINE>
<LINE>To your so infinite loss, so in our trifles</LINE>
<LINE>I still win of you. For my sake wear this:</LINE>
<LINE>It is a manacle of love, I&#8217;ll place it</LINE>
<LINE>Upon this fairest prisoner.</LINE>
</SPEECH>
<STAGEDIR>Putting a bracelet upon her arm.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">O the gods!</LINE>
<LINE>When shall we see again?</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou basest thing, avoid hence, from my sight!</LINE>
<LINE>If after this command thou fraught the court</LINE>
<LINE>With thy unworthiness, thou diest. Away!</LINE>
<LINE>Thou&#8217;rt poison to my blood.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">The gods protect you,</LINE>
<LINE>And bless the good remainders of the court!</LINE>
<LINE>I am gone.</LINE>
</SPEECH>
<STAGEDIR>Exit.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="3">There cannot be a pinch in death</LINE>
<LINE>More sharp than this is.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">O disloyal thing,</LINE>
<LINE>That shouldst repair my youth, thou heap&#8217;st</LINE>
<LINE>A year&#8217;s age on me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">I beseech you, sir,</LINE>
<LINE>Harm not yourself with your vexation,</LINE>
<LINE>I am senseless of your wrath; a touch more rare</LINE>
<LINE>Subdues all pangs, all fears.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Past grace? Obedience?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Past hope, and in despair, that way past grace.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That mightst have had the sole son of my queen!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O blessed, that I might not! I chose an eagle,</LINE>
<LINE>And did avoid a puttock.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou took&#8217;st a beggar, wouldst have made my throne</LINE>
<LINE>A seat for baseness.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">No, I rather added</LINE>
<LINE>A lustre to it.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="3">O thou vild one!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">Sir,</LINE>
<LINE>It is your fault that I have lov&#8217;d Posthumus:</LINE>
<LINE>You bred him as my playfellow, and he is</LINE>
<LINE>A man worth any woman; overbuys me</LINE>
<LINE>Almost the sum he pays.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">What? Art thou mad?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Almost, sir: heaven restore me! Would I were</LINE>
<LINE>A neat-herd&#8217;s daughter, and my Leonatus</LINE>
<LINE>Our neighbor shepherd&#8217;s son!</LINE>
</SPEECH>
<STAGEDIR>Enter Queen.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">Thou foolish thing!</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>To the Queen.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>They were again together; you have done</LINE>
<LINE>Not after our command. Away with her,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="3">Beseech your patience. Peace,</LINE>
<LINE>Dear lady daughter, peace! Sweet sovereign,</LINE>
<LINE>Leave us to ourselves, and make yourself some comfort</LINE>
<LINE>Out of your best advice.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE offset="5">Nay, let her languish</LINE>
<LINE>A drop of blood a day, and being aged</LINE>
<LINE>Die of this folly!</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exit with Lords.</STAGEDIR>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Pisanio.</STAGEDIR>


<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Fie, you must give way.</LINE>
<LINE>Here is your servant. How now, sir? What news?</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="8">Hah?</LINE>
<LINE>No harm, I trust, is done?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PIS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">There might have been,</LINE>
<LINE>But that my master rather play&#8217;d than fought</LINE>
<LINE>And had no help of anger. They were parted</LINE>
<LINE>By gentlemen at hand.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">I am very glad on&#8217;t.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your son&#8217;s my father&#8217;s friend, he takes his part</LINE>
<LINE>To draw upon an exile. O brave sir!</LINE>
<LINE>I would they were in Afric both together,</LINE>
<LINE>Myself by with a needle, that I might prick</LINE>
<LINE>The goer-back. Why came you from your master?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PIS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>On his command. He would not suffer me</LINE>
<LINE>To bring him to the haven; left these notes</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Cloten and two Lords.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. LORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, I would advise you to shift a shirt; the violence of action hath made you reek as a sacrifice. Where air comes out, air comes in; there&#8217;s none abroad so wholesome as that you vent.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If my shirt were bloody, then to shift it. Have I hurt him?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. LORD</SPEAKER>
<STAGEDIR>Aside.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE> No, faith; not so much as his patience.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. LORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hurt him? His body&#8217;s a passable carcass, if he be not hurt; it is a throughfare for steel, if it be not hurt.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. LORD</SPEAKER>
<STAGEDIR>Aside.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE> His steel was in debt, it went o&#8217; th&#8217; backside the town.</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>The villain would not stand me.</LINE>

<LINE> No, but he fled forward still, toward your face.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. LORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Stand you? You have land enough of your own, but he added to your having, gave you some ground.</LINE>

<LINE>And that she should love this fellow, and refuse me!</LINE>

<LINE>Sir, as I told you always; her beauty and her brain go not together. She&#8217;s a good sign, but I have seen small reflection of her wit.</LINE>

<LINE>I would thou grew&#8217;st unto the shores o&#8217; th&#8217; haven,</LINE>

<LINE offset="4">No, madam; for so long</LINE>
<LINE>As he could make me with this eye or ear</LINE>
<LINE>Distinguish him from others, he did keep</LINE>
<LINE>The deck, with glove or hat or handkerchief</LINE>
<LINE>Still waving, as the fits and stirs of &#8217;s mind</LINE>
<LINE>Could best express how slow his soul sail&#8217;d on,</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>I would have broke mine eye-strings, crack&#8217;d them, but</LINE>
<LINE>To look upon him, till the diminution</LINE>
<LINE>Of space had pointed him sharp as my needle;</LINE>
<LINE>Nay, followed him till he had melted from</LINE>
<LINE>The smallness of a gnat to air, and then</LINE>
<LINE>Have turn&#8217;d mine eye and wept. But, good Pisanio,</LINE>

<LINE>I am in heaven for him; or ere I could</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Philario, Jachimo, a Frenchman, a Dutchman, and a Spaniard.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JACH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Believe it, sir, I have seen him in Britain. He was then of a crescent note, expected to prove so worthy as since he hath been allow&#8217;d the name of. But I could then have look&#8217;d on him without the help of admiration, though the catalogue of his endowments had been tabled by his side, and I to peruse him by items.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PHI.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You speak of him when he was less furnish&#8217;d than now he is with that which makes him both without and within.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRENCH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have seen him in France. We had very many there could behold the sun with as firm eyes as he.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JACH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This matter of marrying his king&#8217;s daughter, wherein he must be weigh&#8217;d rather by her value than his own, words him, I doubt not, a great deal from the matter.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRENCH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And then his banishment.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JACH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, and the approbation of those that weep this lamentable divorce under her colors are wonderfully to extend him, be it but to fortify her judgment, which else an easy battery might lay flat, for taking a beggar without less quality. But how comes it he is to sojourn with you? How creeps acquaintance?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PHI.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>His father and I were soldiers together, to whom I have been often bound for no less than my life.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Posthumus.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Here comes the Britain. Let him be so entertain&#8217;d amongst you as suits with gentlemen of your knowing to a stranger of his quality. I beseech you all be better known to this gentleman, whom I commend to you as a noble friend of mine. How worthy he is I will leave to appear hereafter, rather than story him in his own hearing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRENCH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, we have known together in Orleance.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Since when I have been debtor to you for courtesies, which I will be ever to pay and yet pay still.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRENCH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, you o&#8217;errate my poor kindness, I was glad I did atone my countryman and you. It had been pity you should have been put together, with so mortal a purpose as then each bore, upon importance of so slight and trivial a nature.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By your pardon, sir, I was then a young traveller, rather shunn&#8217;d to go even with what I heard than in my every action to be guided by others&#8217; experiences: but upon my mended judgment (if I offend not to say it is mended) my quarrel was not altogether slight.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRENCH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Faith, yes, to be put to the arbiterment of swords, and by such two that would by all likelihood have confounded one the other, or have fall&#8217;n both.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JACH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Can we, with manners, ask what was the difference?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRENCH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Safely, I think; &#8217;twas a contention in public, which may, without contradiction, suffer the report. It was much like an argument that fell out last night, where each of us fell in praise of our country mistresses; this gentleman at that time vouching (and upon warrant of bloody affirmation) his to be more fair, virtuous, wise, chaste, constant, qualified, and less attemptable than any the rarest of our ladies in France.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JACH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That lady is not now living; or this gentleman&#8217;s opinion by this worn out.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She holds her virtue still, and I my mind.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JACH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You must not so far prefer her &#8217;fore ours of Italy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Being so far provok&#8217;d as I was in France, I would abate her nothing, though I profess myself her adorer, not her friend.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JACH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As fair and as good&#8212;a kind of hand-in-hand comparison&#8212;had been something too fair and too good for any lady in Brittany. If she went before others I have seen, as that diamond of yours outlustres many I have beheld, I could not but believe she excell&#8217;d many. But I have not seen the most precious diamond that is, nor you the lady.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I prais&#8217;d her as I rated her: so do I my stone.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JACH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What do you esteem it at?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>More than the world enjoys.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JACH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Either your unparagon&#8217;d mistress is dead, or she&#8217;s outpriz&#8217;d by a trifle.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You are mistaken: the one may be sold or given, or if there were wealth enough for the purchase, or merit for the gift; the other is not a thing for sale, and only the gift of the gods.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JACH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Which the gods have given you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Which, by their graces, I will keep.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JACH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You may wear her in title yours; but you know strange fowl light upon neighboring ponds. Your ring may be stol&#8217;n too: so your brace of unprizable estimations, the one is but frail and the other casual. A cunning thief, or a (that way) accomplish&#8217;d courtier, would hazard the winning both of first and last.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your Italy contains none so accomplish&#8217;d a courtier to convince the honor of my mistress, if in the holding or loss of that you term her frail. I do nothing doubt you have store of thieves; notwithstanding, I fear not my ring.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PHI.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let us leave here, gentlemen.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, with all my heart. This worthy signior, I thank him, makes no stranger of me: we are familiar at first.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JACH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>With five times so much conversation, I should get ground of your fair mistress; make her go back, even to the yielding, had I admittance, and opportunity to friend.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, no.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JACH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I dare thereupon pawn the moi&#8217;ty of my estate to your ring, which in my opinion o&#8217;ervalues it something. But I make my wager rather against your confidence than her reputation; and to bar your offense herein too, I durst attempt it against any lady in the world.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You are a great deal abus&#8217;d in too bold a persuasion, and I doubt not you sustain what y&#8217; are worthy of by your attempt.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JACH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What&#8217;s that?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A repulse, though your attempt (as you call it) deserve more&#8212;a punishment too.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PHI.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Gentlemen, enough of this. It came in too suddenly, let it die as it was born, and I pray you be better acquainted.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JACH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Would I had put my estate and my neighbor&#8217;s on th&#8217; approbation of what I have spoke!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What lady would you choose to assail?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JACH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yours, whom in constancy you think stands so safe. I will lay you ten thousand ducats to your ring, that, commend me to the court where your lady is, with no more advantage than the opportunity of a second conference, and I will bring from thence that honor of hers which you imagine so reserv&#8217;d.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will wage against your gold, gold to it. My ring I hold dear as my finger, &#8217;tis part of it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JACH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You are a friend, and therein the wiser. If you buy ladies&#8217; flesh at a million a dram, you cannot preserve it from tainting. But I see you have some religion in you, that you fear.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This is but a custom in your tongue; you bear a graver purpose, I hope.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JACH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am the master of my speeches, and would undergo what&#8217;s spoken, I swear.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Will you? I shall but lend my diamond till your return. Let there be covenants drawn between &#8217;s. My mistress exceeds in goodness the hugeness of your unworthy thinking. I dare you to this match: here&#8217;s my ring.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PHI.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will have it no lay.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JACH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By the gods, it is one. If I bring you no sufficient testimony that I have enjoy&#8217;d the dearest bodily part of your mistress, my ten thousand ducats are yours, so is your diamond too. If I come off and leave her in such honor as you have trust in, she your jewel, this your jewel, and my gold are yours&#8212;provided I have your commendation for my more free entertainment.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I embrace these conditions, let us have articles betwixt us. Only, thus far you shall answer: if you make your voyage upon her and give me directly to understand you have prevail&#8217;d, I am no further your enemy; she is not worth our debate. If she remain unseduc&#8217;d, you not making it appear otherwise, for your ill opinion and th&#8217; assault you have made to her chastity, you shall answer me with your sword.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JACH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your hand&#8212;a covenant. We will have these things set down by lawful counsel, and straight away for Britain, lest the bargain should catch cold and starve. I will fetch my gold and have our two wagers recorded.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Agreed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt Posthumus and Jachimo.</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>Will this hold, think you?</LINE>

<LINE>Pleaseth your Highness, ay. Here they are, madam.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Presenting a small box.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>But I beseech your Grace, without offense</LINE>
<LINE>(My conscience bids me ask), wherefore you have</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">I wonder, doctor,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou ask&#8217;st me such a question. Have I not been</LINE>
<LINE>Thy pupil long? Hast thou not learn&#8217;d me how</LINE>
<LINE>To make perfumes? Distill? Preserve? Yea so,</LINE>
<LINE>That our great King himself doth woo me oft</LINE>
<LINE>For my confections? Having thus far proceeded</LINE>
<LINE>(Unless thou think&#8217;st me devilish) is&#8217;t not meet</LINE>
<LINE>That I did amplify my judgment in</LINE>
<LINE>Other conclusions? I will try the forces</LINE>
<LINE>Of these thy compounds on such creatures as</LINE>
<LINE>We count not worth the hanging (but none human),</LINE>
<LINE>To try the vigor of them, and apply</LINE>
<LINE>Allayments to their act, and by them gather</LINE>

<LINE>Doctor, your service for this time is ended,</LINE>
<LINE>Take your own way.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE offset="5">Hark thee, a word.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COR.</SPEAKER>
<STAGEDIR>Aside.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>I do not like her. She doth think she has</LINE>
<LINE>Strange ling&#8217;ring poisons. I do know her spirit,</LINE>
<LINE>And will not trust one of her malice with</LINE>
<LINE>A drug of such damn&#8217;d nature. Those she has</LINE>
<LINE>Will stupefy and dull the sense awhile,</LINE>
<LINE>Which first (perchance) she&#8217;ll prove on cats and dogs,</LINE>
<LINE>Then afterward up higher; but there is</LINE>
<LINE>No danger in what show of death it makes,</LINE>
<LINE>More than the locking up the spirits a time,</LINE>
<LINE>To be more fresh, reviving. She is fool&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>With a most false effect; and I the truer,</LINE>
<LINE>So to be false with her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN.</SPEAKER>

<LINE>Weeps she still, say&#8217;st thou? Dost thou think in time</LINE>
<LINE>She will not quench, and let instructions enter</LINE>
<LINE>Where folly now possesses? Do thou work.</LINE>
<LINE>When thou shalt bring me word she loves my son,</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll tell thee on the instant thou art then</LINE>
<LINE>As great as is thy master&#8212;greater, for</LINE>
<LINE>His fortunes all lie speechless, and his name</LINE>
<LINE>Is at last gasp. Return he cannot, nor</LINE>
<LINE>Continue where he is. To shift his being</LINE>
<LINE>Is to exchange one misery with another,</LINE>
<LINE>And every day that comes comes to decay</LINE>
<LINE>A day&#8217;s work in him. What shalt thou expect</LINE>
<LINE>To be depender on a thing that leans?</LINE>
<LINE>Who cannot be new built, nor has no friends</LINE>
<LINE>So much as but to prop him?</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>The Queen drops the box; Pisanio takes it up.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE offset="6">Thou tak&#8217;st up</LINE>
<LINE>Thou know&#8217;st not what; but take it for thy labor.</LINE>
<LINE>It is a thing I made, which hath the King</LINE>
<LINE>Five times redeem&#8217;d from death. I do not know</LINE>
<LINE>What is more cordial. Nay, I prithee take it,</LINE>
<LINE>It is an earnest of a farther good</LINE>
<LINE>That I mean to thee. Tell thy mistress how</LINE>
<LINE>The case stands with her; do&#8217;t as from thyself.</LINE>
<LINE>Think what a chance thou changest on, but think</LINE>
<LINE>Thou hast thy mistress still; to boot, my son,</LINE>
<LINE>Who shall take notice of thee. I&#8217;ll move the King</LINE>
<LINE>To any shape of thy preferment, such</LINE>
<LINE>As thou&#8217;lt desire; and then myself, I chiefly,</LINE>

<LINE>So far I read aloud&#8212;</LINE>

<LINE offset="4">Thanks, fairest lady.</LINE>
<LINE>What, are men mad? Hath nature given them eyes</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JACH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">I never saw him sad.</LINE>
<LINE>There is a Frenchman his companion, one</LINE>

<LINE>A Gallian girl at home. He furnaces</LINE>
<LINE>The thick sighs from him, whiles the jolly Britain</LINE>
<LINE>(Your lord, I mean) laughs from &#8217;s free lungs; cries &#8220;O,</LINE>
<LINE>Can my sides hold, to think that man, who knows</LINE>
<LINE>By history, report, or his own proof,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JACH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, madam, with his eyes in flood with laughter.</LINE>
<LINE>It is a recreation to be by</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">You do seem to know</LINE>
<LINE>Something of me, or what concerns me: pray you&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Since doubting things go ill often hurts more</LINE>
<LINE>Than to be sure they do; for certainties</LINE>
<LINE>Either are past remedies, or, timely knowing,</LINE>

<LINE>Base and illustrious as the smoky light</LINE>
<LINE>That&#8217;s fed with stinking tallow: it were fit</LINE>

<LINE>O dearest soul! Your cause doth strike my heart</LINE>
<LINE>With pity that doth make me sick. A lady</LINE>

<LINE>Would make the great&#8217;st king double&#8212;to be partner&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>With tomboys hir&#8217;d with that self exhibition</LINE>
<LINE>Which your own coffers yield; with diseas&#8217;d ventures</LINE>
<LINE>That play with all infirmities for gold</LINE>
<LINE>Which rottenness can lend nature; such boil&#8217;d stuff</LINE>
<LINE>As well might poison poison. Be reveng&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Or she that bore you was no queen, and you</LINE>
<LINE>Recoil from your great stock.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IMO.</SPEAKER>

<LINE>Let me my service tender on your lips.</LINE>

<LINE>Thou wrong&#8217;st a gentleman, who is as far</LINE>
<LINE>From thy report as thou from honor, and</LINE>
<LINE>Solicits here a lady that disdains</LINE>
<LINE>Thee and the devil alike. What ho, Pisanio!</LINE>
<LINE>The King my father shall be made acquainted</LINE>
<LINE>Of thy assault. If he shall think it fit</LINE>
<LINE>A saucy stranger in his court to mart</LINE>
<LINE>As in a Romish stew, and to expound</LINE>
<LINE>His beastly mind to us, he hath a court</LINE>
<LINE>He little cares for and a daughter who</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JACH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O happy Leonatus! I may say,</LINE>
<LINE>The credit that thy lady hath of thee</LINE>
<LINE>Deserves thy trust, and thy most perfect goodness</LINE>

<LINE>I have spoke this to know if your affiance</LINE>

<LINE>Some dozen Romans of us and your lord</LINE>

<LINE>In France. &#8217;Tis plate of rare device, and jewels</LINE>
<LINE>Of rich and exquisite form, their values great,</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Takes out his tables.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Such and such pictures; there the window; such</LINE>
<LINE>Th&#8217; adornment of her bed; the arras, figures,</LINE>
<LINE>Why, such and such; and the contents o&#8217; th&#8217; story.</LINE>
<LINE>Ah, but some natural notes about her body,</LINE>
<LINE>Above ten thousand meaner moveables</LINE>
<LINE>Would testify, t&#8217; enrich mine inventory.</LINE>
<LINE>O sleep, thou ape of death, lie dull upon her,</LINE>
<LINE>And be her sense but as a monument,</LINE>
<LINE>Thus in a chapel lying! Come off, come off;</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Taking off her bracelet.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>As slippery as the Gordian knot was hard!</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis mine, and this will witness outwardly,</LINE>

<LINE>A mole cinque-spotted, like the crimson drops</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217; th&#8217; bottom of a cowslip. Here&#8217;s a voucher,</LINE>
<LINE>Stronger than ever law could make; this secret</LINE>
<LINE>Will force him think I have pick&#8217;d the lock and ta&#8217;en</LINE>
<LINE>The treasure of her honor. No more: to what end?</LINE>
<LINE>Why should I write this down that&#8217;s riveted,</LINE>
<LINE>Screw&#8217;d to my memory? She hath been reading late</LINE>
<LINE>The tale of Tereus; here the leaf&#8217;s turn&#8217;d down</LINE>
<LINE>Where Philomele gave up. I have enough;</LINE>
<LINE>To th&#8217; trunk again, and shut the spring of it.</LINE>
<LINE>Swift, swift, you dragons of the night, that dawning</LINE>

<LINE>She stripp&#8217;d it from her arm. I see her yet:</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now say, what would Augustus Caesar with us?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>When Julius Caesar (whose remembrance yet</LINE>
<LINE>Lives in men&#8217;s eyes, and will to ears and tongues</LINE>
<LINE>Be theme and hearing ever) was in this Britain,</LINE>
<LINE>And conquer&#8217;d it, Cassibelan, thine uncle</LINE>
<LINE>(Famous in Caesar&#8217;s praises, no whit less</LINE>
<LINE>Than in his feats deserving it), for him</LINE>
<LINE>And his succession granted Rome a tribute,</LINE>
<LINE>Yearly three thousand pounds, which, by thee, lately</LINE>
<LINE>Is left untender&#8217;d.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">And to kill the marvel,</LINE>
<LINE>Shall be so ever.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="3">There be many Caesars,</LINE>
<LINE>Ere such another Julius. Britain&#8217;s a world</LINE>
<LINE>By itself, and we will nothing pay</LINE>
<LINE>For wearing our own noses.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">That opportunity</LINE>
<LINE>Which then they had to take from &#8217;s, to resume</LINE>
<LINE>We have again. Remember, sir, my liege,</LINE>
<LINE>The kings your ancestors, together with</LINE>
<LINE>The natural bravery of your isle, which stands</LINE>
<LINE>As Neptune&#8217;s park, ribb&#8217;d and pal&#8217;d in</LINE>
<LINE>With oaks unscalable and roaring waters,</LINE>
<LINE>With sands that will not bear your enemies&#8217; boats,</LINE>
<LINE>But suck them up to th&#8217; topmast. A kind of conquest</LINE>
<LINE>Caesar made here, but made not here his brag</LINE>
<LINE>Of &#8220;Came, and saw, and overcame.&#8221; With shame</LINE>
<LINE>(The first that ever touch&#8217;d him) he was carried</LINE>
<LINE>From off our coast, twice beaten; and his shipping</LINE>
<LINE>(Poor ignorant baubles!) on our terrible seas,</LINE>
<LINE>Like egg-shells mov&#8217;d upon their surges, crack&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>As easily &#8217;gainst our rocks. For joy whereof</LINE>
<LINE>The fam&#8217;d Cassibelan, who was once at point</LINE>
<LINE>(O giglet Fortune!) to master Caesar&#8217;s sword,</LINE>
<LINE>Made Lud&#8217;s-Town with rejoicing fires bright,</LINE>
<LINE>And Britains strut with courage.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, there&#8217;s no more tribute to be paid. Our kingdom is stronger than it was at that time; and (as I said) there is no more such Caesars. Other of them may have crook&#8217;d noses, but to owe such straight arms, none.</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Son, let your mother end.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We have yet many among us can gripe as hard as Cassibelan. I do not say I am one; but I have a hand. Why tribute? Why should we pay tribute? If Caesar can hide the sun from us with a blanket, or put the moon in his pocket, we will pay him tribute for light; else, sir, no more tribute, pray you now.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CYM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You must know,</LINE>
<LINE>Till the injurious Romans did extort</LINE>
<LINE>This tribute from us, we were free. Caesar&#8217;s ambition,</LINE>
<LINE>Which swell&#8217;d so much that it did almost stretch</LINE>
<LINE>The sides o&#8217; th&#8217; world, against all color here</LINE>
<LINE>Did put the yoke upon &#8217;s; which to shake off</LINE>
<LINE>Becomes a warlike people, whom we reckon</LINE>
<LINE>Ourselves to be. We do say then to Caesar,</LINE>
<LINE>Our ancestor was that Mulmutius which</LINE>
<LINE>Ordain&#8217;d our laws, whose use the sword of Caesar</LINE>
<LINE>Hath too much mangled, whose repair and franchise</LINE>
<LINE>Shall (by the power we hold) be our good deed,</LINE>
<LINE>Though Rome be therefore angry. Mulmutius made our laws,</LINE>
<LINE>Who was the first of Britain which did put</LINE>
<LINE>His brows within a golden crown and call&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>Himself a king.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="3">I am sorry, Cymbeline,</LINE>
<LINE>That I am to pronounce Augustus Caesar</LINE>
<LINE>(Caesar, that hath more kings his servants than</LINE>
<LINE>Thyself domestic officers) thine enemy.</LINE>
<LINE>Receive it from me then: war and confusion</LINE>
<LINE>In Caesar&#8217;s name pronounce I &#8217;gainst thee; look</LINE>

<LINE>Which he to seek of me again, perforce,</LINE>
<LINE>Behooves me keep at utterance. I am perfect</LINE>
<LINE>That the Pannonians and Dalmatians for</LINE>

<LINE>(As poisonous tongu&#8217;d as handed) hath prevail&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>On thy too ready hearing? Disloyal? No.</LINE>
<LINE>She&#8217;s punish&#8217;d for her truth, and undergoes,</LINE>
<LINE>More goddess-like than wife-like, such assaults</LINE>
<LINE>As would take in some virtue. O my master,</LINE>
<LINE>Thy mind to her is now as low as were</LINE>
<LINE>Thy fortunes. How? That I should murder her,</LINE>
<LINE>Upon the love and truth and vows which I</LINE>
<LINE>Have made to thy command? I, her? Her blood?</LINE>
<LINE>If it be so to do good service, never</LINE>

<LINE>That we two are asunder; let that grieve him:</LINE>
<LINE>Some griefs are med&#8217;cinable, that is one of them,</LINE>
<LINE>For it doth physic love&#8212;of his content,</LINE>
<LINE>All but in that! Good wax, thy leave. Blest be</LINE>

<LINE>And men in dangerous bonds pray not alike;</LINE>
<LINE>Though forfeiters you cast in prison, yet</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Reads.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>&#8220;Justice, and your father&#8217;s wrath, should he take me in his dominion, could not be so cruel to me as you, O the dearest of creatures, would even renew me with your eyes. Take notice that I am in Cambria, at Milford-Haven; what your own love will out of this advise you, follow. So he wishes you all happiness, that remains loyal to his vow, and your increasing in love.</LINE>
<LINE>Leonatus Posthumus.&#8221;</LINE>
<LINE>O for a horse with wings! Hear&#8217;st thou, Pisanio?</LINE>
<LINE>He is at Milford-Haven. Read, and tell me</LINE>
<LINE>How far &#8217;tis thither. If one of mean affairs</LINE>

<LINE>When you above perceive me like a crow,</LINE>
<LINE>That it is place which lessens and sets off,</LINE>
<LINE>And you may then revolve what tales I have told you</LINE>
<LINE>Of courts, of princes, of the tricks in war.</LINE>
<LINE>This service is not service, so being done,</LINE>
<LINE>But being so allowed. To apprehend thus</LINE>
<LINE>Draws us a profit from all things we see;</LINE>
<LINE>And often, to our comfort, shall we find</LINE>
<LINE>The sharded beetle in a safer hold</LINE>
<LINE>Than is the full-wing&#8217;d eagle. O, this life</LINE>
<LINE>Is nobler than attending for a check;</LINE>
<LINE>Richer than doing nothing for a bable;</LINE>
<LINE>Prouder than rustling in unpaid-for silk:</LINE>
<LINE>Such gain the cap of him that makes him fine,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet keeps his book uncross&#8217;d. No life to ours.</LINE>

<LINE>What air&#8217;s from home. Happ&#8217;ly this life is best,</LINE>
<LINE>If quiet life be best; sweeter to you</LINE>
<LINE>That have a sharper known; well corresponding</LINE>
<LINE>With your stiff age; but unto us it is</LINE>

<LINE>The freezing hours away? We have seen nothing.</LINE>
<LINE>We are beastly: subtle as the fox for prey,</LINE>
<LINE>Like warlike as the wolf for what we eat;</LINE>

<LINE>As hard to leave as keep; whose top to climb</LINE>

<LINE>As record of fair act; nay, many times</LINE>
<LINE>Doth ill deserve by doing well; what&#8217;s worse,</LINE>
<LINE>Must curtsy at the censure. O boys, this story</LINE>
<LINE>The world may read in me: my body&#8217;s mark&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>With Roman swords, and my report was once</LINE>
<LINE>First with the best of note. Cymbeline lov&#8217;d me,</LINE>
<LINE>And when a soldier was the theme, my name</LINE>
<LINE>Was not far off. Then was I as a tree</LINE>
<LINE>Whose boughs did bend with fruit; but in one night,</LINE>
<LINE>A storm or robbery (call it what you will)</LINE>
<LINE>Shook down my mellow hangings, nay, my leaves,</LINE>

<LINE>But that two villains, whose false oaths prevail&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>Before my perfect honor, swore to Cymbeline</LINE>
<LINE>I was confederate with the Romans. So</LINE>
<LINE>Followed my banishment, and this twenty years</LINE>
<LINE>This rock and these demesnes have been my world,</LINE>
<LINE>Where I have liv&#8217;d at honest freedom, paid</LINE>
<LINE>More pious debts to heaven than in all</LINE>
<LINE>The fore-end of my time. But up to th&#8217; mountains!</LINE>

<LINE>How hard it is to hide the sparks of nature!</LINE>
<LINE>These boys know little they are sons to th&#8217; King,</LINE>

<LINE>They think they are mine, and though train&#8217;d up thus meanly</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217; th&#8217; cave wherein they bow, their thoughts do hit</LINE>
<LINE>The roofs of palaces, and nature prompts them</LINE>
<LINE>In simple and low things to prince it much</LINE>
<LINE>Beyond the trick of others. This Polydore,</LINE>
<LINE>The heir of Cymbeline and Britain, who</LINE>
<LINE>The King his father call&#8217;d Guiderius&#8212;Jove!</LINE>
<LINE>When on my three-foot stool I sit and tell</LINE>
<LINE>The warlike feats I have done, his spirits fly out</LINE>
<LINE>Into my story; say, &#8220;Thus mine enemy fell,</LINE>
<LINE>And thus I set my foot on &#8217;s neck,&#8221; even then</LINE>
<LINE>The princely blood flows in his cheek, he sweats,</LINE>
<LINE>Strains his young nerves, and puts himself in posture</LINE>
<LINE>That acts my words. The younger brother, Cadwal,</LINE>
<LINE>Once Arviragus, in as like a figure</LINE>
<LINE>Strikes life into my speech, and shows much more</LINE>
<LINE>His own conceiving.&#8212;Hark, the game is rous&#8217;d!&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>O Cymbeline, heaven and my conscience knows</LINE>
<LINE>Thou didst unjustly banish me; whereon,</LINE>
<LINE>At three and two years old, I stole these babes,</LINE>
<LINE>Thinking to bar thee of succession, as</LINE>
<LINE>Thou refts me of my lands. Euriphile,</LINE>

<LINE>Poor I am stale, a garment out of fashion,</LINE>

<LINE>I draw the sword myself, take it, and hit</LINE>

<LINE>Fear not, &#8217;tis empty of all things but grief.</LINE>
<LINE>Thy master is not there, who was indeed</LINE>

<LINE>The time inviting thee? The perturb&#8217;d court</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Meet thee at Milford-Haven! (I forgot to ask him one thing, I&#8217;ll remember&#8217;t anon.) Even there, thou villain Posthumus, will I kill thee. I would these garments were come. She said upon a time (the bitterness of it I now belch from my heart) that she held the very garment of Posthumus in more respect than my noble and natural person, together with the adornment of my qualities. With that suit upon my back will I ravish her; first kill him, and in her eyes; there shall she see my valor, which will then be a torment to her contempt. He on the ground, my speech of insultment ended on his dead body, and when my lust hath din&#8217;d (which, as I say, to vex her I will execute in the clothes that she so prais&#8217;d), to the court I&#8217;ll knock her back, foot her home again. She hath despis&#8217;d me rejoicingly, and I&#8217;ll be merry in my revenge.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Pisanio with the clothes.</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>Bring this apparel to my chamber. That is the second thing that I have commanded thee. The third is, that thou wilt be a voluntary mute to my design.

<LINE>But that my resolution helps me. Milford,</LINE>
<LINE>When from the mountain top Pisanio show&#8217;d thee,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou wast within a ken. O Jove, I think</LINE>
<LINE>Foundations fly the wretched: such, I mean,</LINE>

<LINE>A punishment or trial? Yes; no wonder,</LINE>
<LINE>When rich ones scarce tell true. To lapse in fullness</LINE>

Therein I must play the workman. I dare speak it to myself, for it is not vainglory for a man and his glass to confer in his own chamber&#8212;I mean, the lines of my body are as well drawn as his; no less young, more strong, not beneath him in fortunes, beyond him in the advantage of the time, above him in birth, alike conversant in general services, and more remarkable in single oppositions; yet this imperceiverant thing loves him in my despite. What mortality is! Posthumus, thy head, which now is growing upon thy shoulders, shall within this hour be off, thy mistress enforc&#8217;d, thy garments cut to pieces before her face: and all this done, spurn her home to her father, who may (happily) be a little angry for my so rough usage; but my mother, having power of his testiness, shall turn all into my commendations. My horse is tied up safe; out, sword, and to a sore purpose! Fortune put them into my hand! This is the very description of their meeting-place, and the fellow dares not deceive me.</LINE>

<LINE>With his own single hand he&#8217;ld take us in,</LINE>

<LINE>Why, worthy father, what have we to lose,</LINE>

<LINE>Play judge and executioner all himself,</LINE>

<LINE>From one bad thing to worse, not frenzy, not</LINE>
<LINE>Absolute madness could so far have rav&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>To bring him here alone; although perhaps</LINE>
<LINE>It may be heard at court that such as we</LINE>
<LINE>Cave here, hunt here, are outlaws, and in time</LINE>
<LINE>May make some stronger head, the which he hearing</LINE>
<LINE>(As it is like him), might break out and swear</LINE>
<LINE>He&#8217;ld fetch us in; yet is&#8217;t not probable</LINE>

<LINE>These flow&#8217;rs are like the pleasures of the world;</LINE>

<LINE>For so I thought I was a cave-keeper,</LINE>
<LINE>And cook to honest creatures. But &#8217;tis not so.</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Twas but a bolt of nothing, shot at nothing,</LINE>
<LINE>Which the brain makes of fumes. Our very eyes</LINE>

<LINE>Pisanio might have kill&#8217;d thee at the heart</LINE>

<LINE>The drug he gave me, which he said was precious</LINE>

<SPEAKER>POST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yea, bloody cloth, I&#8217;ll keep thee, for I wish&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>Thou shouldst be color&#8217;d thus. You married ones,</LINE>
<LINE>If each of you should take this course, how many</LINE>
<LINE>Must murder wives much better than themselves</LINE>
<LINE>For wrying but a little! O Pisanio,</LINE>
<LINE>Every good servant does not all commands;</LINE>
<LINE>No bond, but to do just ones. Gods, if you</LINE>
<LINE>Should have ta&#8217;en vengeance on my faults, I never</LINE>
<LINE>Had liv&#8217;d to put on this; so had you saved</LINE>
<LINE>The noble Imogen to repent, and strook</LINE>
<LINE>Me, wretch, more worth your vengeance. But alack,</LINE>
<LINE>You snatch some hence for little faults; that&#8217;s love,</LINE>
<LINE>To have them fall no more: you some permit</LINE>
<LINE>To second ills with ills, each elder worse,</LINE>
<LINE>And make them dread it, to the doers&#8217; thrift.</LINE>
<LINE>But Imogen is your own, do your best wills,</LINE>
<LINE>And make me blest to obey. I am brought hither</LINE>
<LINE>Among th&#8217; Italian gentry, and to fight</LINE>
<LINE>Against my lady&#8217;s kingdom. &#8217;Tis enough</LINE>
<LINE>That, Britain, I have kill&#8217;d thy mistress; peace,</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll give no wound to thee. Therefore, good heavens,</LINE>
<LINE>Hear patiently my purpose: I&#8217;ll disrobe me</LINE>
<LINE>Of these Italian weeds and suit myself</LINE>
<LINE>As does a Britain peasant; so I&#8217;ll fight</LINE>
<LINE>Against the part I come with; so I&#8217;ll die</LINE>
<LINE>For thee, O Imogen, even for whom my life</LINE>
<LINE>Is every breath a death; and thus, unknown,</LINE>
<LINE>Pitied nor hated, to the face of peril</LINE>
<LINE>Myself I&#8217;ll dedicate. Let me make men know</LINE>
<LINE>More valor in me than my habits show.</LINE>
<LINE>Gods, put the strength o&#8217; th&#8217; Leonati in me!</LINE>
<LINE>To shame the guise o&#8217; th&#8217; world, I will begin</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Lucius, Jachimo, and the Roman army at one door, and the Britain army at another; Leonatus Posthumus following, like a poor soldier. They march over and go out. Then enter again, in skirmish, Jachimo and Posthumus: he vanquisheth and disarmeth Jachimo, and then leaves him.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEAKER>JACH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The heaviness and guilt within my bosom</LINE>
<LINE>Takes off my manhood. I have belied a lady,</LINE>
<LINE>The Princess of this country; and the air on&#8217;t</LINE>
<LINE>Revengingly enfeebles me, or could this carl,</LINE>
<LINE>A very drudge of nature&#8217;s, have subdu&#8217;d me</LINE>
<LINE>In my profession? Knighthoods and honors, borne</LINE>
<LINE>As I wear mine, are titles but of scorn.</LINE>
<LINE>If that thy gentry, Britain, go before</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No blame be to you, sir, for all was lost</LINE>
<LINE>But that the heavens fought; the King himself</LINE>
<LINE>Of his wings destitute, the army broken,</LINE>
<LINE>And but the backs of Britains seen, all flying</LINE>
<LINE>Through a strait lane; the enemy full-hearted,</LINE>
<LINE>Lolling the tongue with slaught&#8217;ring&#8212;having work</LINE>
<LINE>More plentiful than tools to do&#8217;t&#8212;strook down</LINE>
<LINE>Some mortally, some slightly touch&#8217;d, some falling</LINE>
<LINE>Merely through fear, that the strait pass was damm&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>With dead men hurt behind, and cowards living</LINE>
<LINE>To die with length&#8217;ned shame.</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<LINE offset="6">Where was this lane?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Close by the battle, ditch&#8217;d, and wall&#8217;d with turf,</LINE>
<LINE>Which gave advantage to an ancient soldier</LINE>
<LINE>(An honest one, I warrant), who deserv&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>So long a breeding as his white beard came to,</LINE>
<LINE>In doing this for &#8217;s country. Athwart the lane,</LINE>
<LINE>He, with two striplings (lads more like to run</LINE>
<LINE>The country base than to commit such slaughter,</LINE>
<LINE>With faces fit for masks, or rather fairer</LINE>
<LINE>Than those for preservation cas&#8217;d, or shame),</LINE>
<LINE>Made good the passage, cried to those that fled,</LINE>
<LINE>&#8220;Our Britain&#8217;s harts die flying, not our men.</LINE>
<LINE>To darkness fleet souls that fly backwards. Stand,</LINE>
<LINE>Or we are Romans and will give you that</LINE>
<LINE>Like beasts which you shun beastly, and may save</LINE>
<LINE>But to look back in frown. Stand, stand!&#8221; These three,</LINE>
<LINE>Three thousand confident, in act as many&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>For three performers are the file when all</LINE>
<LINE>The rest do nothing&#8212;with this word &#8220;Stand, stand!&#8221;</LINE>
<LINE>Accommodated by the place, more charming</LINE>
<LINE>With their own nobleness, which could have turn&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>A distaff to a lance, gilded pale looks;</LINE>
<LINE>Part shame, part spirit renew&#8217;d, that some, turn&#8217;d coward</LINE>
<LINE>But by example (O, a sin in war,</LINE>
<LINE>Damn&#8217;d in the first beginners!), gan to look</LINE>
<LINE>The way that they did, and to grin like lions</LINE>
<LINE>Upon the pikes o&#8217; th&#8217; hunters. Then began</LINE>
<LINE>A stop i&#8217; th&#8217; chaser; a retire; anon</LINE>
<LINE>A rout, confusion thick. Forthwith they fly</LINE>
<LINE>Chickens, the way which they stoop&#8217;d eagles; slaves,</LINE>
<LINE>The strides they victors made: and now our cowards,</LINE>
<LINE>Like fragments in hard voyages, became</LINE>
<LINE>The life o&#8217; th&#8217; need. Having found the back door open</LINE>
<LINE>Of the unguarded hearts, heavens, how they wound</LINE>
<LINE>Some slain before, some dying, some their friends</LINE>
<LINE>O&#8217;erborne i&#8217; th&#8217; former wave. Ten chas&#8217;d by one</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, do not wonder at it; you are made</LINE>
<LINE>Rather to wonder at the things you hear</LINE>

<LINE>&#8220;Two boys, an old man (twice a boy), a lane,</LINE>

<LINE>Today how many would have given their honors</LINE>
<LINE>To have sav&#8217;d their carcasses! Took heel to do&#8217;t,</LINE>
<LINE>And yet died too! I, in mine own woe charm&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Could not find death where I did hear him groan,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor feel him where he strook. Being an ugly monster,</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis strange he hides him in fresh cups, soft beds,</LINE>
<LINE>Sweet words; or hath more ministers than we</LINE>
<LINE>That draw his knives i&#8217; th&#8217; war. Well, I will find him;</LINE>
<LINE>For being now a favorer to the Britain,</LINE>
<LINE>No more a Britain, I have resum&#8217;d again</LINE>
<LINE>The part I came in. Fight I will no more,</LINE>
<LINE>But yield me to the veriest hind that shall</LINE>

<LINE>Here made by th&#8217; Roman; great the answer be</LINE>

<LINE>Most welcome, bondage! For thou art a way,</LINE>

<LINE>T&#8217; unbar these locks. My conscience, thou art fetter&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>More than my shanks and wrists. You good gods, give me</LINE>
<LINE>The penitent instrument to pick that bolt,</LINE>
<LINE>Then free forever! Is&#8217;t enough I am sorry?</LINE>
<LINE>So children temporal fathers do appease;</LINE>
<LINE>Gods are more full of mercy. Must I repent,</LINE>
<LINE>I cannot do it better than in gyves,</LINE>
<LINE>Desir&#8217;d more than constrain&#8217;d. To satisfy,</LINE>
<LINE>If of my freedom &#8217;tis the main part, take</LINE>
<LINE>No stricter render of me than my all.</LINE>
<LINE>I know you are more clement than vild men,</LINE>
<LINE>Who of their broken debtors take a third,</LINE>
<LINE>A sixt, a tenth, letting them thrive again</LINE>
<LINE>On their abatement. That&#8217;s not my desire.</LINE>
<LINE>For Imogen&#8217;s dear life take mine, and though</LINE>

<LINE>You rather, mine being yours; and so, great pow&#8217;rs,</LINE>

<LINE>&#8217;Tis still a dream, or else such stuff as madmen</LINE>
<LINE>Tongue and brain not; either both or nothing,</LINE>

<LINE>Hanging is the word, sir. If you be ready for that, you are well cook&#8217;d.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>POST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So if I prove a good repast to the spectators, the dish pays the shot.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. JAIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A heavy reckoning for you, sir. But the comfort is, you shall be call&#8217;d to no more payments, fear no more tavern-bills, which are often the sadness of parting, as the procuring of mirth. You come in faint for want of meat, depart reeling with too much drink; sorry that you have paid too much, and sorry that you are paid too much; purse and brain both empty; the brain the heavier for being too light, the purse too light, being drawn of heaviness. O, of this contradiction you shall now be quit. O, the charity of a penny cord! It sums up thousands in a trice. You have no true debitor and creditor but it: of what&#8217;s past, is, and to come, the discharge. Your neck, sir, is pen, book, and counters; so the acquittance follows.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>1. JAIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Indeed, sir, he that sleeps feels not the toothache; but a man that were to sleep your sleep, and a hangman to help him to bed, I think he would change places with his officer; for, look you, sir, you know not which way you shall go.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Yes indeed do I, fellow.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. JAIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your death has eyes in&#8217; s head then; I have not seen him so pictur&#8217;d. You must either be directed by some that take upon them to know, or to take upon yourself that which I am sure you do not know, or jump the after-inquiry on your own peril; and how you shall speed in your journey&#8217;s end, I think You&#8217;ll never return to tell one.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I tell thee, fellow, there are none want eyes to direct them the way I am going, but such as wink and will not use them.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. JAIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What an infinite mock is this, that a man should have the best use of eyes to see the way of blindness! I am sure hanging&#8217;s the way of winking.</LINE>

<LINE>Unless a man would marry a gallows and beget young gibbets, I never saw one so prone. Yet, on my conscience, there are verier knaves desire to live, for all he be a Roman; and there be some of them too that die against their wills. So should I, if I were one. I would we were all of one mind, and one mind good. O, there were desolation of jailers and gallowses! I speak against my present profit, but my wish hath a preferment in&#8217;t.</LINE>
