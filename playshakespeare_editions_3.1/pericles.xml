<stagedir>Enter Gower.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>GOW.</speaker>
<line>To sing a song that old was sung,</line>
<line>From ashes ancient Gower is come,</line>
<line>Assuming man&#8217;s infirmities,</line>
<line>To glad your ear and please your eyes.</line>
<line>It hath been sung at festivals,</line>
<line>On ember-eves and holy-ales;</line>
<line>And lords and ladies in their lives</line>
<line>Have read it for restoratives.</line>
<line>The purchase is to make men glorious,</line>
<line><latin xml:lang="la">Et bonum quo antiquius, eo melius</latin>.</line>
<line>If you, born in those latter times,</line>
<line>When wit&#8217;s more ripe, accept my rhymes,</line>
<line>And that to hear an old man sing</line>
<line>May to your wishes pleasure bring,</line>
<line>I life would wish, and that I might</line>
<line>Waste it for you like taper-light.</line>
<line>This&#8217; Antioch, then; Antiochus the Great</line>
<line>Built up this city for his chiefest seat,</line>
<line>The fairest in all Syria&#8212;</line>
<line>I tell you what mine authors say.</line>
<line>This king unto him took a peer,</line>
<line>Who died and left a female heir,</line>
<line>So buxom, blithe, and full of face</line>
<line>As heaven had lent her all his grace;</line>
<line>With whom the father liking took,</line>
<line>And her to incest did provoke&#8212;</line>
<line>Bad child, worse father, to entice his own</line>
<line>To evil should be done by none.</line>
<line>But custom what they did begin</line>
<line>Was with long use account&#8217;d no sin.</line>
<line>The beauty of this sinful dame</line>
<line>Made many princes thither frame</line>
<line>To seek her as a bedfellow,</line>
<line>In marriage pleasures playfellow;</line>
<line>Which to prevent he made a law,</line>
<line>To keep her still and men in awe,</line>
<line>That whoso ask&#8217;d her for his wife,</line>
<line>His riddle told not, lost his life.</line>
<line>So for her many a wight did die,</line>
<line>As yon grim looks do testify.</line>
<stagedir>Points to the heads of the unsuccessful suitors, displayed above.</stagedir>
<line>What now ensues, to the judgment of your eye</line>
<line>I give my cause, who best can justify.</line>

<speaker>ANT.</speaker>
<line>Young Prince of Tyre, you have at large received</line>
<line>The danger of the task you undertake.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PER.</speaker>
<line>I have, Antiochus, and with a soul</line>
<line>Embold&#8217;ned with the glory of her praise,</line>
<line>Think death no hazard in this enterprise.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Music.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>ANT.</speaker>
<line>Bring in our daughter, clothed like a bride</line>
<line>For embracements even of Jove himself;</line>
<line>At whose conception, till Lucina reigned,</line>
<line>Nature this dowry gave: to glad her presence,</line>
<line>The senate-house of planets all did sit,</line>
<line>To knit in her their best perfections.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Antiochus&#8217; Daughter.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>PER.</speaker>
<line>See where she comes, apparelled like the spring,</line>
<line>Graces her subjects, and her thoughts the king</line>
<line>Of every virtue gives renown to men!</line>
<line>Her face the book of praises, where is read</line>
<line>Nothing but curious pleasures, as from thence</line>
<line>Sorrow were ever ras&#8217;d, and testy wrath</line>
<line>Could never be her mild companion.</line>
<line>You gods that made me man, and sway in love,</line>
<line>That have inflam&#8217;d desire in my breast</line>
<line>To taste the fruit of yon celestial tree</line>
<line>(Or die in th&#8217; adventure), be my helps,</line>
<line>As I am son and servant to your will,</line>
<line>To compass such a boundless happiness!</line>

<line>Prince Pericles&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PER.</speaker>
<line>That would be son to great Antiochus.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANT.</speaker>
<line>Before thee stands this fair Hesperides,</line>
<line>With golden fruit, but dangerous to be touch&#8217;d;</line>
<line>For death-like dragons here affright thee hard.</line>
<line>Her face, like heaven, enticeth thee to view</line>
<line>Her countless glory, which desert must gain;</line>
<line>And which without desert because thine eye</line>
<line>Presumes to reach, all the whole heap must die.</line>
<line>Yon sometimes famous princes, like thyself,</line>
<line>Drawn by report, advent&#8217;rous by desire,</line>
<line>Tell thee, with speechless tongues and semblance pale,</line>
<line>That without covering, save yon field of stars,</line>
<line>Here they stand martyrs, slain in Cupid&#8217;s wars;</line>
<line>And with dead cheeks advise thee to desist</line>
<line>For going on death&#8217;s net, whom none resist.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PER.</speaker>
<line>Antiochus, I thank thee, who hath taught</line>
<line>My frail mortality to know itself,</line>
<line>And by those fearful objects to prepare</line>
<line>This body, like to them, to what I must;</line>
<line>For death remembered should be like a mirror,</line>
<line>Who tells us life&#8217;s but breath, to trust it error.</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll make my will then, and as sick men do,</line>
<line>Who know the world, see heaven, but feeling woe,</line>
<line>Gripe not at earthly joys as erst they did;</line>
<line>So I bequeath a happy peace to you</line>
<line>And all good men, as every prince should do;</line>
<line>My riches to the earth from whence they came;</line>

<stagedir>To the Princess.</stagedir>
<line>But my unspotted fire of love to you.</line>
<line>Thus ready for the way of life or death,</line>
<line>I wait the sharpest blow, Antiochus.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANT.</speaker>
<line>Scorning advice, read the conclusion then;</line>
<line>Which read and not expounded, &#8217;tis decreed,</line>
<line>As these before thee, thou thyself shalt bleed.</line>

<speaker>DAUGH.</speaker>
<line>Of all &#8217;say&#8217;d yet, mayst thou prove prosperous!</line>
<line>Of all &#8217;say&#8217;d yet, I wish thee happiness!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PER.</speaker>
<line>Like a bold champion I assume the lists,</line>
<line>Nor ask advice of any other thought</line>
<line>But faithfulness and courage.</line>

<stagedir>The Riddle</stagedir>
<line><RECITE>I am no viper, yet I feed</RECITE></line>
<line><RECITE>On mother&#8217;s flesh which did me breed.</RECITE></line>
<line><RECITE>I sought a husband, in which labor</RECITE></line>
<line><RECITE>I found that kindness in a father.</RECITE></line>
<line><RECITE>He&#8217;s father, son, and husband mild;</RECITE></line>

<stagedir>Aside.</stagedir>
<line>Sharp physic is the last. But O you powers!</line>
<line>That gives heaven countless eyes to view men&#8217;s acts,</line>
<line>Why cloud they not their sights perpetually,</line>
<line>If this be true which makes me pale to read it?</line>

<stagedir>Aside to the Princess.</stagedir>
<line>Fair glass of light, I lov&#8217;d you, and could still,</line>
<line>Were not this glorious casket stor&#8217;d with ill.</line>
<line>But I must tell you, now my thoughts revolt,</line>
<line>For he&#8217;s no man on whom perfections wait</line>
<line>That, knowing sin within, will touch the gate.</line>
<line>You are a fair viol, and your sense the strings;</line>
<line>Who, finger&#8217;d to make man his lawful music,</line>
<line>Would draw heaven down, and all the gods to hearken;</line>
<line>But being play&#8217;d upon before your time,</line>
<line>Hell only danceth at so harsh a chime.</line>
<line>Good sooth, I care not for you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANT.</speaker>
<line>Prince Pericles, touch not, upon thy life,</line>
<line>For that&#8217;s an article within our law,</line>
<line>As dangerous as the rest. Your time&#8217;s expir&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Either expound now, or receive your sentence.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PER.</speaker>
<line>Great King,</line>
<line>Few love to hear the sins they love to act;</line>
<line>&#8217;Twould braid yourself too near for me to tell it.</line>
<line>Who has a book of all that monarchs do,</line>
<line>He&#8217;s more secure to keep it shut than shown;</line>
<line>For vice repeated is like the wand&#8217;ring wind,</line>
<line>Blows dust in others&#8217; eyes, to spread itself;</line>
<line>And yet the end of all is bought thus dear,</line>
<line>The breath is gone, and the sore eyes see clear</line>
<line>To stop the air would hurt them. The blind mole casts</line>
<line>Copp&#8217;d hills towards heaven, to tell the earth is throng&#8217;d</line>
<line>By man&#8217;s oppression, and the poor worm doth die for&#8217;t.</line>
<line>Kings are earth&#8217;s gods; in vice their law&#8217;s their will;</line>
<line>And if Jove stray, who dares say Jove doth ill?</line>
<line>It is enough you know, and it is fit,</line>
<line>What being more known grows worse, to smother it.</line>
<line>All love the womb that their first being bred,</line>
<line>Then give my tongue like leave to love my head.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANT.</speaker><stagedir>Aside.</stagedir>
<line>Heaven, that I had thy head! He has found the meaning.</line>
<line>But I will gloze with him.&#8212;Young Prince of Tyre,</line>
<line>Though by the tenor of our strict edict,</line>
<line>Your exposition misinterpreting,</line>
<line>We might proceed to cancel of your days;</line>
<line>Yet hope, succeeding from so fair a tree</line>
<line>As your fair self, doth tune us otherwise.</line>
<line>Forty days longer we do respite you;</line>
<line>If by which time our secret be undone,</line>
<line>This mercy shows we&#8217;ll joy in such a son;</line>
<line>And until then your entertain shall be</line>
<line>As doth befit our honor and your worth.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exeunt. Manet Pericles solus.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>PER.</speaker>
<line>How courtesy would seem to cover sin,</line>
<line>When what is done is like an hypocrite,</line>
<line>The which is good in nothing but in sight!</line>
<line>If it be true that I interpret false,</line>
<line>Then were it certain you were not so bad</line>
<line>As with foul incest to abuse your soul;</line>
<line>Where now you&#8217;re both a father and a son</line>
<line>By your uncomely claspings with your child</line>
<line>(Which pleasures fits a husband, not a father),</line>
<line>And she an eater of her mother&#8217;s flesh</line>
<line>By the defiling of her parent&#8217;s bed;</line>
<line>And both like serpents are, who though they feed</line>
<line>On sweetest flowers, yet they poison breed.</line>
<line>Antioch, farewell, for wisdom sees those men</line>
<line>Blush not in actions blacker than the night</line>
<line>Will &#8217;schew no course to keep them from the light.</line>
<line>One sin, I know, another doth provoke:</line>
<line>Murder&#8217;s as near to lust as flame to smoke;</line>
<line>Poison and treason are the hands of sin,</line>
<line>Ay, and the targets to put off the shame;</line>
<line>Then lest my life be cropp&#8217;d to keep you clear,</line>
<line>By flight I&#8217;ll shun the danger which I fear.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>ANT.</speaker>
<line>He hath found the meaning,</line>

<line>He must not live to trumpet forth my infamy,</line>
<line>Nor tell the world Antiochus doth sin</line>
<line>In such a loathed manner;</line>
<line>And therefore instantly this prince must die,</line>

<line>To your secrecy; and for your faithfulness</line>
<line>We will advance you, Thaliard. Behold,</line>
<line>Here&#8217;s poison and here&#8217;s gold; we hate the Prince</line>

<speaker>PER.</speaker>
<line>Let none disturb us.</line>

<stagedir>Exeunt Lords.</stagedir>
<line offset="4">Why should this change of thoughts,</line>
<line>The sad companion, dull-ey&#8217;d melancholy,</line>
<line>Be my so us&#8217;d a guest as not an hour</line>
<line>In the day&#8217;s glorious walk or peaceful night,</line>
<line>The tomb where grief should sleep, can breed me quiet?</line>
<line>Here pleasures court mine eyes, and mine eyes shun them,</line>
<line>And danger, which I fear&#8217;d, is at Antioch,</line>
<line>Whose arm seems far too short to hit me here.</line>
<line>Yet neither pleasure&#8217;s art can joy my spirits,</line>
<line>Nor yet the other&#8217;s distance comfort me.</line>
<line>Then it is thus: the passions of the mind,</line>
<line>That have their first conception by misdread,</line>
<line>Have after-nourishment and life by care;</line>
<line>And what was first but fear what might be done,</line>
<line>Grows elder now, and cares it be not done.</line>
<line>And so with me: the great Antiochus,</line>
<line>&#8217;Gainst whom I am too little to contend,</line>
<line>Since he&#8217;s so great can make his will his act,</line>
<line>Will think me speaking, though I swear to silence;</line>
<line>Nor boots it me to say I honor him,</line>
<line>If he suspect I may dishonor him;</line>
<line>And what may make him blush in being known,</line>
<line>He&#8217;ll stop the course by which it might be known.</line>
<line>With hostile forces he&#8217;ll o&#8217;erspread the land,</line>
<line>And with th&#8217; ostent of war will look so huge,</line>
<line>Amazement shall drive courage from the state,</line>
<line>Our men be vanquish&#8217;d ere they do resist,</line>
<line>And subjects punish&#8217;d that ne&#8217;er thought offense:</line>
<line>Which care of them, not pity of myself&#8212;</line>
<line>Who am no more but as the tops of trees,</line>
<line>Which fence the roots they grow by and defend them&#8212;</line>
<line>Makes both my body pine and soul to languish,</line>

<line>Where, as thou know&#8217;st, against the face of death</line>
<line>I sought the purchase of a glorious beauty,</line>
<line>From whence an issue I might propagate,</line>
<line>Are arms to princes and bring joys to subjects.</line>
<line>Her face was to mine eye beyond all wonder;</line>
<line>The rest (hark in thine ear) as black as incest,</line>

<line>Under the covering of a careful night,</line>
<line>Who seem&#8217;d my good protector, and being here,</line>
<line>Bethought what was past, what might succeed.</line>

<line>Well, my lord, since you have given me leave to speak,</line>

<line>So this is Tyre, and this the court. Here must I kill King Pericles; and if I do it not, I am sure to be hang&#8217;d at home. &#8217;Tis dangerous. Well, I perceive he was a wise fellow and had good discretion that, being bid to ask what he would of the king, desir&#8217;d he might know none of his secrets. Now do I see he had some reason for&#8217;t; for if a king bid a man be a villain, he&#8217;s bound by the indenture of his oath to be one. Husht! Here comes the lords of Tyre.</line>

<stagedir>Enter Helicanus, Escanes, with other Lords.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>HEL.</speaker>
<line>Royal Antiochus, on what cause I know not,</line>
<line>Took some displeasure at him, at lease he judg&#8217;d so;</line>
<line>And doubting lest he had err&#8217;d or sinn&#8217;d,</line>
<line>To show his sorrow, he&#8217;d correct himself;</line>

<speaker>THAL.</speaker><stagedir>Aside.</stagedir>
<line>Well, I perceive</line>
<line>I shall not be hang&#8217;d now, although I would;</line>
<line>But since he&#8217;s gone, the King&#8217;s seas must please:</line>
<line>He scap&#8217;d the land to perish at the sea.</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll present myself.&#8212;Peace to the lords of Tyre!</line>

<speech>

<line>We have no reason to desire it,</line>

<line>Those mothers who, to nousle up their babes,</line>
<line>Thought nought too curious, are ready now</line>
<line>To eat those little darlings whom they lov&#8217;d.</line>

<line>Here stands a lord, and there a lady weeping;</line>

<line>I thought as much.</line>
<line>One sorrow never comes but brings an heir</line>

<speech>
<speaker>3. FISH.</speaker>
<line>Faith, master, I am thinking of the poor men that were cast away before us even now.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. FISH.</speaker>
<line>Alas, poor souls, it griev&#8217;d my heart to hear what pitiful cries they made to us to help them, when, well-a-day, we could scarce help ourselves.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>3. FISH.</speaker>
<line>Nay, master, said not I as much when I saw the porpas how he bounc&#8217;d and tumbled? They say they&#8217;re half fish, half flesh. A plague on them, they ne&#8217;er come but I look to be wash&#8217;d. Master, I marvel how the fishes live in the sea.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. FISH.</speaker>
<line>Why, as men do a-land; the great ones eat up the little ones. I can compare our rich misers to nothing so fitly as to a whale: &#8217;a plays and tumbles, driving the poor fry before him, and at last devour them all at a mouthful. Such whales have I heard on a&#8217; th&#8217; land, who never leave gaping till they swallow&#8217;d the whole parish, church, steeple, bells, and all.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>2. FISH.</speaker>
<line>Why, man?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>3. FISH.</speaker>
<line>Because he should have swallow&#8217;d me too, and when I had been in his belly, I would have kept such a jangling of the bells, that he should never have left till he cast bells, steeple, church, and parish up again. But if the good King Simonides were of my mind&#8212;</line>

<speaker>2. FISH.</speaker>
<line>Ay, but hark you, my friend, &#8217;twas we that made up this garment through the rough seams of the waters. There are certain condolements, certain vails. I hope, sir, if you thrive, You&#8217;ll remember from whence you had them.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>PER.</speaker>
<line>Believe&#8217;t, I will.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>SIM.</speaker>
<line>It&#8217;s fit it should be so, for princes are</line>

<line>He hopes by you his fortunes yet may flourish.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. LORD. PENT.</speaker>
<line>He had need mean better than his outward show</line>
<line>Can any way speak in his just commend;</line>
<line>For by his rusty outside he appears</line>

<line>He well may be a stranger, for he comes</line>

<speech>
<speaker>SIM.</speaker>
<line>Knights,</line>
<line>To say you&#8217;re welcome were superfluous.</line>
<line>To place upon the volume of your deeds,</line>
<line>As in a title-page, your worth in arms,</line>

<line>Call it by what you will, the day is your,</line>
<line>And here, I hope, is none that envies it.</line>
<line>In framing an artist, art hath thus decreed,</line>

<line>By Juno, that is queen of marriage,</line>
<line>All viands that I eat do seem unsavory,</line>

</speech>

<speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PER.</speaker>
<stagedir>Aside.</stagedir>
<line>Yon king&#8217;s to me like to my father&#8217;s picture,</line>
<line>Which tells me in that glory once he was;</line>
<line>Had princes sit like stars about his throne,</line>
<line>And he the sun for them to reverence;</line>
<line>None that beheld him but, like lesser lights,</line>
<line>Did vail their crowns to his supremacy;</line>
<line>Where now his son&#8217;s like a glow-worm in the night,</line>
<line>The which hath fire in darkness, none in light:</line>
<line>Whereby I see that Time&#8217;s the king of men,</line>
<line>He&#8217;s both their parent, and he is their grave,</line>
<line>And gives them what he will, not what they crave.</line>
</speech>

<speaker>SIM.</speaker>
<line>What, are you merry, knights?</line>

<speech>
<speaker>ALL KNIGHTS.</speaker>

<line>Had not a show might countervail his worth.</line>
<line>Note it not you, Thaisa?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>THAI.</speaker>

<line>To me, my father?</line>

<line>Princes in this should live like gods above,</line>
<line>Who freely give to every one that come</line>
<line>To honor them;</line>
<line>And princes not doing so are like to gnats,</line>
<line>Which make a sound, but kill&#8217;d are wond&#8217;red at.</line>
<line>Therefore to make his entrance more sweet,</line>
<line>Here, say we drink this standing-bowl of wine to him.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>THAI.</speaker>
<line>Alas, my father, it befits not me</line>
<line>Unto a stranger knight to be so bold.</line>
<line>He may my proffer take for an offense,</line>
<line>Since men take women&#8217;s gifts for impudence.</line>

<line>He thanks your Grace; names himself Pericles,</line>
<line>A gentleman of Tyre,</line>
<line>Who only by misfortune of the seas</line>
<line>Bereft of ships and men, cast on this shore.</line>

<speaker>SIM.</speaker>
<line>Now by the gods, I pity his misfortune,</line>
<line>And will awake him from his melancholy.</line>
<line>Come, gentlemen, we sit too long on trifles,</line>
<line>And waste the time, which looks for other revels.</line>
<line>Even in your armors, as you are address&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Will well become a soldier&#8217;s dance.</line>
<line>I will not have excuse with saying this,</line>
<line>Loud music is too harsh for ladies&#8217; heads,</line>
<line>Since they love men in arms as well as beds.</line>

<stagedir>They dance.</stagedir>
<line>So, this was well ask&#8217;d, &#8217;twas so well perform&#8217;d.</line>

<line>In those that practice them they are, my lord.</line>

<speaker>SIM.</speaker>
<line>Sir, my daughter thinks very well of you,</line>
<line>Ay, so well, that you must be her master,</line>
<line>And she will be your scholar; therefore look to it.</line>

<line>I am unworthy for her schoolmaster.</line>

<line>O, seek not to entrap me, gracious lord,</line>
<line>A stranger and distressed gentleman,</line>
<line>That never aim&#8217;d so high to love your daughter,</line>
<line>But bent all offices to honor her.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIM.</speaker>
<line>Thou hast bewitch&#8217;d my daughter, and thou art</line>
<line>A villain.</line>

<line>Now by the gods, I do applaud his courage.</line>
</speech>

<speech>

<line>I came unto your court for honor&#8217;s cause,</line>

<line>And he that otherwise accounts of me,</line>

<line offset="4">who, for aught I know,</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>THAI.</speaker>
<line offset="6">Yes, if you love me, sir.</line>

<line>Now sleep yslacked hath the rout,</line>

<line>The cat, with eyne of burning coal,</line>

<line>Hymen hath brought the bride to bed,</line>
<line>Where, by the loss of maidenhead,</line>
<line>A babe is moulded. Be attent,</line>
<line>And time that is so briefly spent</line>
<line>With your fine fancies quaintly eche:</line>
<line>What&#8217;s dumb in show I&#8217;ll plain with speech.</line>

<stagedir>Dumb Show.</stagedir>
<stagedir>Enter Pericles and Simonides, at one door, with Attendants. The Second Tyrian Messenger meets them, kneels, and gives Pericles a letter. Pericles shows it Simonides; the Lords kneel to him. Then enter Thaisa with child, with Lychorida, a nurse. The King shows her the letter; she rejoices. She and Pericles take leave of her father, and depart with Lychorida and their Attendants. Then exeunt Simonides and the rest.</stagedir>
<line>By many a dern and painful perch,</line>
<line>Of Pericles the careful search,</line>
<line>By the four opposing coigns</line>
<line>Which the world together joins,</line>
<line>Is made with all due diligence</line>
<line>That horse and sail and high expense</line>
<line>Can stead the quest. At last from Tyre,</line>
<line>Fame answering the most strange inquire,</line>
<line>To th&#8217; court of King Simonides</line>
<line>Are letters brought, the tenor these:</line>
<line>Antiochus and his daughter dead,</line>
<line>The men of Tyrus on the head</line>
<line>Of Helicanus would set on</line>
<line>The crown of Tyre, but he will none.</line>
<line>The mutiny he there hastes t&#8217; oppress,</line>
<line>Says to &#8217;em, if King Pericles</line>
<line>Come not home in twice six moons,</line>
<line>He, obedient to their dooms,</line>
<line>Will take the crown. The sum of this,</line>
<line>Brought hither to Pentapolis,</line>
<line>Yravished the regions round,</line>
<line>And every one with claps can sound,</line>
<line>&#8220;Our heir-apparent is a king!</line>
<line>Who dreamt? Who thought of such a thing?&#8221;</line>
<line>Brief, he must hence depart to Tyre:</line>
<line>His queen, with child, makes her desire&#8212;</line>
<line>Which who shall cross?&#8212;along to go.</line>
<line>Omit we all their dole and woe.</line>
<line>Lychorida, her nurse, she takes,</line>
<line>And so to sea. Their vessel shakes</line>
<line>On Neptune&#8217;s billow; half the flood</line>
<line>Hath their keel cut. But fortune, mov&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Varies again; the grisled north</line>
<line>Disgorges such a tempest forth,</line>
<line>That, as a duck for life that dives,</line>
<line>So up and down the poor ship drives.</line>
<line>The lady shrieks, and well-a-near</line>
<line>Does fall in travail with her fear;</line>
<line>And what ensues in this fell storm</line>
<line>Shall for itself itself perform.</line>
<line>I nill relate, action may</line>
<line>Conveniently the rest convey,</line>
<line>Which might not what by me is told.</line>

<line>How does my queen?&#8212;Thou storm, venomously</line>

<line>Patience, good sir, do not assist the storm.</line>
<line>Here&#8217;s all that is left living of your queen:</line>

<line>What courage, sir? God save you!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PER.</speaker>
<line>Courage enough. I do not fear the flaw,</line>

<line>Sir, your queen must overboard. The sea works high, the wind is loud, and will not lie till the ship be clear&#8217;d of the dead.</line>

<line>Must cast thee, scarcely coffin&#8217;d, in the ooze,</line>
<line>Where, for a monument upon thy bones,</line>
<line>The e&#8217;er-remaining lamps, the belching whale</line>
<line>And humming water must o&#8217;erwhelm thy corpse,</line>
<line>Lying with simple shells. O Lychorida,</line>
<line>Bid Nestor bring me spices, ink and paper,</line>
<line>My casket and my jewels; and bid Nicander</line>

<line>O, our credit comes not in like the commodity, nor the commodity wages not with the danger; therefore if in our youths we could pick up some pretty estate, &#8217;twere not amiss to keep our door hatch&#8217;d.

<speech>
<speaker>BAWD.</speaker>
<line>You are light into my hands, where you are like to live.</line>

<line>Ay, and you shall live in pleasure.</line>
</speech>

<line>No.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>BAWD.</speaker>
<line>Yes indeed shall you, and taste gentlemen of all fashions. You shall fare well, you shall have the difference of all complexions. What do you stop your ears?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MAR.</speaker>
<line>Are you a woman?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BAWD.</speaker>
<line>What would you have me be, and I be not a woman?</line>

<speech>

<line>An honest woman, or not a woman.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>BAWD.</speaker>
<line>Marry, whip the gosling, I think I shall have something to do with you. Come, you&#8217;re a young foolish sapling, and must be bow&#8217;d as I would have you.</line>

<stagedir>Enter Boult.</stagedir>
<line>Now, sir, hast thou cried her through the market?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BOULT.</speaker>
<line>I have cried her almost to the number of her hairs, I have drawn her picture with my voice.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BAWD.</speaker>
<line>And I prithee tell me, how dost thou find the inclination of the people, especially of the younger sort?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BOULT.</speaker>
<line>Faith, they listen&#8217;d to me as they would have hearken&#8217;d to their father&#8217;s testament. There was a Spaniard&#8217;s mouth wat&#8217;red, and he went to bed to her very description.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BAWD.</speaker>
<line>We shall have him here tomorrow with his best ruff on.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BOULT.</speaker>
<line>Tonight, tonight. But, mistress, do you know the French knight that cow&#8217;rs i&#8217; the hams?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BAWD.</speaker>
<line>Who, Monsieur Verollus?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BOULT.</speaker>
<line>Ay, he, he offer&#8217;d to cut a caper at the proclamation, but he made a groan at it, and swore he would see her tomorrow.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BAWD.</speaker>
<line>Well, well, as for him, he brought his disease hither; here he does but repair it. I know he will come in our shadow, to scatter his crowns in the sun.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BOULT.</speaker>
<line>Well, if we had of every nation a traveller, we should lodge them with this sign.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BAWD.</speaker>
<stagedir>To Marina.</stagedir>
<line>Pray you come hither a while. You have fortunes coming upon you. Mark me: you must seem to do that fearfully which you commit willingly, despise profit where you have most gain. To weep that you live as ye do makes pity in your lovers; seldom but that pity begets you a good opinion, and that opinion a mere profit.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MAR.</speaker>
<line>I understand you not.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BOULT.</speaker>
<line>O, take her home, mistress, take her home. These blushes of hers must be quench&#8217;d with some present practice.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BAWD.</speaker>
<line>Thou sayest true, i&#8217; faith, so they must: for your bride goes to that with shame which is her way to go with warrant.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BOULT.</speaker>
<line>Faith, some do, and some do not. But, mistress, if I have bargain&#8217;d for the joint&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BAWD.</speaker>
<line>Thou mayst cut a morsel off the spit.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BOULT.</speaker>
<line>I may so.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BAWD.</speaker>
<line>Who should deny it? Come, young one, I like the manner of your garments well.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BOULT.</speaker>
<line>Ay, by my faith, they shall not be chang&#8217;d yet.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BAWD.</speaker>
<line>Boult, spend thou that in the town. Report what a sojoumer we have; You&#8217;ll lose nothing by custom. When nature fram&#8217;d this piece, she meant thee a good turn; therefore say what a paragon she is, and thou hast the harvest out of thine own report.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BOULT.</speaker>
<line>I warrant you, mistress, thunder shall not so awake the beds of eels as my giving out her beauty stirs up the lewdly inclin&#8217;d. I&#8217;ll bring home some tonight.</line>

<line>By you being pardoned, we commit no crime</line>

<line>Where our scenes seems to live. I do beseech you</line>
<line>To learn of me, who stand i&#8217; th&#8217; gaps to teach you,</line>
<line>The stages of our story. Pericles</line>
<line>Is now again thwarting the wayward seas,</line>
<line>Attended on by many a lord and knight,</line>

<line>Old Helicanus goes along. Behind</line>

<line>Leaves Tharsus and again embarks. He swears</line>

<line>He puts on sackcloth, and to sea. He bears</line>

<speaker>BAWD.</speaker>
<line>Fie, fie upon her, she&#8217;s able to freeze the god Priapus, and undo a whole generation. We must either get her ravish&#8217;d or be rid of her. When she should do for clients her fitment, and do me the kindness of our profession, she has me her quirks, her reasons, her master reasons, her prayers, her knees, that she would make a puritan of the devil, if he should cheapen a kiss of her.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>MAR.</speaker>
<line>Neither of these are so bad as thou art,</line>

<line>Thou hold&#8217;st a place for which the pained&#8217;st fiend</line>
<line>Of hell would not in reputation change.</line>
<line>Thou art the damned door-keeper to every</line>
<line>Custrel that comes inquiring for his Tib.</line>
<line>To the choleric fisting of every rogue</line>
<line>Thy ear is liable; thy food is such</line>
<line>As hath been belch&#8217;d on by infected lungs.</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MAR.</speaker>
<line>Do any thing but this thou doest. Empty</line>
<line>Old receptacles, or common shores, of filth,</line>
<line>Serve by indenture to the common hangman:</line>
<line>Any of these ways are yet better than this;</line>
<line>For what thou professest, a baboon, could he speak,</line>
<line>Would own a name too dear. That the gods</line>
<line>Would safely deliver me from this place!</line>
<line>Here, here&#8217;s gold for thee.</line>
<line>If that thy master would gain by me,</line>
<line>Proclaim that I can sing, weave, sew, and dance,</line>
<line>With other virtues, which I&#8217;ll keep from boast,</line>
<line>And will undertake all these to teach.</line>
<line>I doubt not but this populous city will</line>
<line>Yield many scholars.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BOULT.</speaker>
<line>But can you teach all this you speak of?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MAR.</speaker>
<line>Prove that I cannot, take me home again</line>
<line>And prostitute me to the basest groom</line>
<line>That doth frequent your house.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BOULT.</speaker>
<line>Well, I will see what I can do for thee. If I can place thee, I will.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MAR.</speaker>
<line>But amongst honest women.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BOULT.</speaker>
<line>Faith, my acquaintance lies little amongst them. But since my master and mistress hath bought you, there&#8217;s no going but by their consent. Therefore I will make them acquainted with your purpose, and I doubt not but I shall find them tractable enough. Come, I&#8217;ll do for thee what I can; come your ways.</line>

<line>Thou that wast born at sea, buried at Tharsus,</line>
<line>And found at sea again! O Helicanus,</line>
<line>Down on thy knees, thank the holy gods as loud</line>
<line>As thunder threatens us. This is Marina.</line>
<line>What was thy mother&#8217;s name? Tell me but that,</line>

<line>Thou hast been godlike perfit,</line>
<line>The heir of kingdoms, and another life</line>
<line>To Pericles thy father.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MAR.</speaker>
<line>Is it no more to be your daughter than</line>
<line>To say my mother&#8217;s name was Thaisa?</line>
<line>Thaisa was my mother, who did end</line>
<line>The minute I began.</line>
</speech>

<speech>

<line>By savage Cleon. She shall tell thee all,</line>
<line>When thou shalt kneel, and justify in knowledge</line>
<line>She is thy very princess. Who is this?</line>

<speech>
<speaker>HEL.</speaker>
<line>Sir, &#8217;tis the governor of Mytilene,</line>

<line>Now our sands are almost run,</line>

<line>This, my last boon, give me,</line>

<line>What pageantry, what feats, what shows,</line>
<line>What minstrelsy, and pretty din,</line>
<line>The regent made in Metelin,</line>
<line>To greet the King. So he thrived</line>

<line>Hail, Dian! To perform thy just command,</line>
<line>I here confess myself the King of Tyre,</line>
<line>Who frighted from my country, did wed</line>
<line>At Pentapolis the fair Thaisa.</line>
<line>At sea in child-bed died she, but brought forth</line>
<line>A maid-child call&#8217;d Marina, whom, O goddess,</line>
<line>Wears yet thy silver livery. She at Tharsus</line>
<line>Was nurs&#8217;d with Cleon, who at fourteen years</line>
<line>He sought to murder, but her better stars</line>
<line>Brought her to Mytilene, &#8217;gainst whose shore</line>
<line>Riding, her fortunes brought the maid aboard us,</line>
<line>Where, by her own most clear remembrance, she</line>
<line>Made known herself my daughter.</line>

<line>Look to the lady; O, she&#8217;s but overjoy&#8217;d.</line>
<line>Early in blustering morn this lady was</line>

<line>Found there rich jewels, recovered her, and plac&#8217;d her</line>
<line>Here in Diana&#8217;s temple.</line>

<line offset="3">O, let me look!</line>

<line>When we with tears parted Pentapolis,</line>

<stagedir>Points to his ring.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>PER.</speaker>
<line>This, this. No more, you gods! Your present kindness</line>
<line>Makes my past miseries sports. You shall do well</line>

<speech>		
<speaker>GOW.</speaker>
<line>In Antiochus and his daughter you have heard</line>
<line>Of monstrous lust the due and just reward.</line>
<line>In Pericles, his queen and daughter, seen,</line>
<line>Although assail&#8217;d with fortune fierce and keen,</line>
<line>Virtue preserv&#8217;d from fell destruction&#8217;s blast,</line>
<line>Led on by heaven, and crown&#8217;d with joy at last.</line>
<line>In Helicanus may you well descry</line>
<line>A figure of truth, of faith, of loyalty.</line>
<line>In reverend Cerimon there well appears</line>
<line>The worth that learned charity aye wears.</line>
<line>For wicked Cleon and his wife, when fame</line>
<line>Had spread his cursed deed, the honor&#8217;d name</line>
<line>Of Pericles to rage the city turn,</line>
<line>That him and his they in his palace burn;</line>
<line>The gods for murder seemed so content</line>
<line>To punish, although not done, but meant.</line>
<line>So, on your patience evermore attending,</line>
<line>New joy wait on you! Here our play has ending.</line>
