<speech>
<speaker>PHI.</speaker>
<line>Nay, but this dotage of our general&#8217;s</line>
<line>O&#8217;erflows the measure. Those his goodly eyes,</line>
<line>That o&#8217;er the files and musters of the war</line>
<line>Have glow&#8217;d like plated Mars, now bend, now turn</line>
<line>The office and devotion of their view</line>
<line>Upon a tawny front; his captain&#8217;s heart,</line>
<line>Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst</line>
<line>The buckles on his breast, reneges all temper,</line>
<line>And is become the bellows and the fan</line>
<line>To cool a gypsy&#8217;s lust.</line>

<stagedir>Flourish. Enter Antony, Cleopatra, her Ladies, the Train, with eunuchs fanning her.</stagedir>
<line offset="5">Look where they come!</line>
<line>Take but good note, and you shall see in him</line>
<line>The triple pillar of the world transform&#8217;d</line>
<line>Into a strumpet&#8217;s fool. Behold and see.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CLEO.</speaker>
<line>If it be love indeed, tell me how much.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANT.</speaker>
<line>There&#8217;s beggary in the love that can be reckon&#8217;d.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CLEO.</speaker>
<line>I&#8217;ll set a bourn how far to be belov&#8217;d.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANT.</speaker>
<line>Then must thou needs find out new heaven, new earth.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter First Roman Messenger.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>1. ROM. MESS.</speaker>
<line>News, my good lord, from Rome.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANT.</speaker>
<line offset="7">Grates me, the sum.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CLEO.</speaker>
<line>Nay, hear them, Antony.</line>
<line>Fulvia perchance is angry; or who knows</line>
<line>If the scarce-bearded Caesar have not sent</line>
<line>His pow&#8217;rful mandate to you: &#8220;Do this, or this;</line>
<line>Take in that kingdom, and enfranchise that;</line>
<line>Perform&#8217;t, or else we damn thee.&#8221;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANT.</speaker>
<line offset="7">How, my love?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CLEO.</speaker>
<line>Perchance? Nay, and most like.</line>
<line>You must not stay here longer, your dismission</line>
<line>Is come from Caesar, therefore hear it, Antony.</line>
<line>Where&#8217;s Fulvia&#8217;s process?&#8212;Caesar&#8217;s, I would say&#8212;both?</line>
<line>Call in the messengers. As I am Egypt&#8217;s queen,</line>
<line>Thou blushest, Antony, and that blood of thine</line>
<line>Is Caesar&#8217;s homager; else so thy cheek pays shame</line>
<line>When shrill-tongu&#8217;d Fulvia scolds. The messengers!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANT.</speaker>
<line>Let Rome in Tiber melt, and the wide arch</line>
<line>Of the rang&#8217;d empire fall! Here is my space,</line>
<line>Kingdoms are clay; our dungy earth alike</line>
<line>Feeds beast as man; the nobleness of life</line>
<line>Is to do thus</line>

<stagedir>Embracing.</stagedir>
<line offset="5">&#8212;when such a mutual pair</line>
<line>And such a twain can do&#8217;t, in which I bind,</line>
<line>On pain of punishment, the world to weet</line>
<line>We stand up peerless.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CLEO.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Excellent falsehood!</line>
<line>Why did he marry Fulvia, and not love her?</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll seem the fool I am not. Antony</line>
<line>Will be himself.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANT.</speaker>
<line offset="4">But stirr&#8217;d by Cleopatra.</line>
<line>Now for the love of Love, and her soft hours,</line>
<line>Let&#8217;s not confound the time with conference harsh;</line>
<line>There&#8217;s not a minute of our lives should stretch</line>
<line>Without some pleasure now. What sport tonight?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CLEO.</speaker>
<line>Hear the ambassadors.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANT.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Fie, wrangling queen!</line>
<line>Whom every thing becomes&#8212;to chide, to laugh,</line>
<line>To weep; whose every passion fully strives</line>
<line>To make itself (in thee) fair and admir&#8217;d!</line>
<line>No messenger but thine, and all alone,</line>
<line>Tonight we&#8217;ll wander through the streets and note</line>
<line>The qualities of people. Come, my queen,</line>
<line>Last night you did desire it.</line>

</speech>

<stagedir>Exeunt Antony and Cleopatra with the Train, followed by the Messenger.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>DEM.</speaker>
<line>Is Caesar with Antonius priz&#8217;d so slight?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PHI.</speaker>
<line>Sir, sometimes when he is not Antony,</line>
<line>He comes too short of that great property</line>
<line>Which still should go with Antony.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DEM.</speaker>
<line offset="7">I am full sorry</line>
<line>That he approves the common liar, who</line>
<line>Thus speaks of him at Rome; but I will hope</line>
<line>Of better deeds tomorrow. Rest you happy!</line>

<line>Lord Alexas, sweet Alexas, most any thing Alexas, almost most absolute Alexas, where&#8217;s the soothsayer that you prais&#8217;d so to th&#8217; Queen? O that I knew this husband, which, you say, must change his horns with garlands!</line>

<line>Is this the man? Is&#8217;t you, sir, that know things?</line>

<line>In nature&#8217;s infinite book of secrecy</line>

<line>Good sir, give me good fortune.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SOOTH.</speaker>
<line>I make not, but foresee.</line>
</speech>

<line>Pray then, foresee me one.</line>

<line>Vex not his prescience, be attentive.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CHAR.</speaker>
<line>Hush!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SOOTH.</speaker>
<line>You shall be more beloving than beloved.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CHAR.</speaker>
<line>I had rather heat my liver with drinking.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ALEX.</speaker>
<line>Nay, hear him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CHAR.</speaker>
<line>Good now, some excellent fortune! Let me be married to three kings in a forenoon, and widow them all. Let me have a child at fifty, to whom Herod of Jewry may do homage. Find me to marry me with Octavius Caesar, and companion me with my mistress.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SOOTH.</speaker>
<line>You shall outlive the lady whom you serve.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CHAR.</speaker>
<line>O, excellent, I love long life better than figs.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SOOTH.</speaker>
<line>You have seen and prov&#8217;d a fairer former fortune</line>
<line>Than that which is to approach.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CHAR.</speaker>
<line>Then belike my children shall have no names. Prithee, how many boys and wenches must I have?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SOOTH.</speaker>
<line>If every of your wishes had a womb,</line>
<line>And fertile every wish, a million.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CHAR.</speaker>
<line>Out, fool, I forgive thee for a witch.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ALEX.</speaker>
<line>You think none but your sheets are privy to your wishes.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CHAR.</speaker>
<line>Nay, come, tell Iras hers.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ALEX.</speaker>
<line>We&#8217;ll know all our fortunes.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ENO.</speaker>
<line>Mine, and most of our fortunes tonight, shall be&#8212;drunk to bed.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IRAS.</speaker>
<line>There&#8217;s a palm presages chastity, if nothing else.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CHAR.</speaker>
<line>E&#8217;en as the o&#8217;erflowing Nilus presageth famine.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IRAS.</speaker>
<line>Go, you wild bedfellow, you cannot soothsay.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CHAR.</speaker>
<line>Nay, if an oily palm be not a fruitful prognostication, I cannot scratch mine ear. Prithee tell her but a worky-day fortune.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SOOTH.</speaker>
<line>Your fortunes are alike.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IRAS.</speaker>
<line>But how, but how? Give me particulars.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SOOTH.</speaker>
<line>I have said.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IRAS.</speaker>
<line>Am I not an inch of fortune better than she?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CHAR.</speaker>
<line>Well, if you were but an inch of fortune better than I, where would you choose it?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IRAS.</speaker>
<line>Not in my husband&#8217;s nose.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CHAR.</speaker>
<line>Our worser thoughts heavens mend! Alexas&#8212;come, his fortune, his fortune! O, let him marry a woman that cannot go, sweet Isis, I beseech thee! And let her die too, and give him a worse! And let worse follow worse, till the worst of all follow him laughing to his grave, fiftyfold a cuckold! Good Isis, hear me this prayer, though thou deny me a matter of more weight; good Isis, I beseech thee!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IRAS.</speaker>
<line>Amen. Dear goddess, hear that prayer of the people! For, as it is a heart-breaking to see a handsome man loose-wiv&#8217;d, so it is a deadly sorrow to behold a foul knave uncuckolded; therefore, dear Isis, keep decorum, and fortune him accordingly!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CHAR.</speaker>
<line>Amen.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ALEX.</speaker>
<line>Lo now, if it lay in their hands to make me a cuckold, they would make themselves whores but they&#8217;ld do&#8217;t!</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Cleopatra.</stagedir>

<line>Hush, here comes Antony.</line>

<speaker>ANT.</speaker>
<line>Against my brother Lucius?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. MESS.</speaker>
<line>Ay;</line>
<line>But soon that war had end, and the time&#8217;s state</line>
<line>Made friends of them, jointing their force &#8217;gainst Caesar,</line>
<line>Whose better issue in the war from Italy,</line>
<line>Upon the first encounter, drave them.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANT.</speaker>
<line offset="8">Well, what worst?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. MESS.</speaker>
<line>The nature of bad news infects the teller.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANT.</speaker>
<line>When it concerns the fool or coward. On:</line>
<line>Things that are past are done with me. &#8217;Tis thus:</line>
<line>Who tells me true, though in his tale lie death,</line>
<line>I hear him as he flatter&#8217;d.</line>

<line>Speak to me home, mince not the general tongue;</line>
<line>Name Cleopatra as she is call&#8217;d in Rome.</line>
<line>Rail thou in Fulvia&#8217;s phrase, and taunt my faults</line>
<line>With such full license as both truth and malice</line>
<line>Have power to utter. O then we bring forth weeds</line>
<line>When our quick winds lie still, and our ills told us</line>
<line>Is as our earing. Fare thee well awhile.</line>

<stagedir>Enter Second Messenger with a letter.</stagedir>
<line offset="5">What are you?</line>
</speech>

<speech>

<line>Fulvia thy wife is dead.</line>

<stagedir>Gives a letter.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>ANT.</speaker>
<line offset="7">Forbear me.</line>
<stagedir>Exit Second Messenger.</stagedir>
<line>There&#8217;s a great spirit gone! Thus did I desire it.</line>
<line>What our contempts doth often hurl from us,</line>
<line>We wish it ours again. The present pleasure,</line>
<line>By revolution low&#8217;ring, does become</line>
<line>The opposite of itself. She&#8217;s good, being gone;</line>
<line>The hand could pluck her back that shov&#8217;d her on.</line>
<line>I must from this enchanting queen break off;</line>
<line>Ten thousand harms, more than the ills I know,</line>
<line>My idleness doth hatch. How now, Enobarbus?</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Enobarbus.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>ENO.</speaker>
<line>What&#8217;s your pleasure, sir?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANT.</speaker>
<line>I must with haste from hence.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ENO.</speaker>
<line>Why then we kill all our women. We see how mortal an unkindness is to them; if they suffer our departure, death&#8217;s the word.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANT.</speaker>
<line>I must be gone.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ENO.</speaker>
<line>Under a compelling occasion, let women die. It were pity to cast them away for nothing, though between them and a great cause, they should be esteem&#8217;d nothing. Cleopatra, catching but the least noise of this, dies instantly; I have seen her die twenty times upon far poorer moment. I do think there is mettle in death, which commits some loving act upon her, she hath such a celerity in dying.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANT.</speaker>
<line>She is cunning past man&#8217;s thought.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ENO.</speaker>
<line>Alack, sir, no, her passions are made of nothing but the finest part of pure love. We cannot call her winds and waters sighs and tears; they are greater storms and tempests than almanacs can report. This cannot be cunning in her; if it be, she makes a show&#8217;r of rain as well as Jove.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANT.</speaker>
<line>Would I had never seen her!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ENO.</speaker>
<line>O, sir, you had then left unseen a wonderful piece of work, which not to have been blest withal would have discredited your travel.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANT.</speaker>
<line>Fulvia is dead.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ENO.</speaker>
<line>Sir?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANT.</speaker>
<line>Fulvia is dead.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ENO.</speaker>
<line>Fulvia?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANT.</speaker>
<line>Dead.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ENO.</speaker>
<line>Why, sir, give the gods a thankful sacrifice. When it pleaseth their deities to take the wife of a man from him, it shows to man the tailors of the earth; comforting therein, that when old robes are worn out, there are members to make new. If there were no more women but Fulvia, then had you indeed a cut, and the case to be lamented. This grief is crown&#8217;d with consolation: your old smock brings forth a new petticoat, and indeed the tears live in an onion that should water this sorrow.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANT.</speaker>
<line>The business she hath broached in the state</line>
<line>Cannot endure my absence.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ENO.</speaker>
<line>And the business you have broach&#8217;d here cannot be without you, especially that of Cleopatra&#8217;s, which wholly depends on your abode.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANT.</speaker>
<line>No more light answers. Let our officers</line>
<line>Have notice what we purpose. I shall break</line>
<line>The cause of our expedience to the Queen,</line>
<line>And get her leave to part. For not alone</line>
<line>The death of Fulvia, with more urgent touches,</line>
<line>Do strongly speak to us; but the letters too</line>
<line>Of many our contriving friends in Rome</line>
<line>Petition us at home. Sextus Pompeius</line>
<line>Hath given the dare to Caesar, and commands</line>
<line>The empire of the sea. Our slippery people,</line>
<line>Whose love is never link&#8217;d to the deserver</line>
<line>Till his deserts are past, begin to throw</line>
<line>Pompey the Great and all his dignities</line>
<line>Upon his son, who, high in name and power,</line>
<line>Higher than both in blood and life, stands up</line>
<line>For the main soldier; whose quality, going on,</line>
<line>The sides o&#8217; th&#8217; world may danger. Much is breeding,</line>
<line>Which, like the courser&#8217;s hair, hath yet but life,</line>
<line>And not a serpent&#8217;s poison. Say our pleasure,</line>
<line>To such whose places under us require,</line>
<line>Our quick remove from hence.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ENO.</speaker>
<line>I shall do&#8217;t.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>CLEO.</speaker>
<line>I know by that same eye there&#8217;s some good news.</line>
<line>What, says the married woman you may go?</line>
<line>Would she had never given you leave to come!</line>
<line>Let her not say &#8217;tis I that keep you here,</line>
<line>I have no power upon you; hers you are.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>ANT.</speaker>
<line>The gods best know&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CLEO.</speaker>
<line offset="4">O, never was there queen</line>
<line>So mightily betrayed! Yet at the first</line>

<speech>
<speaker>CLEO.</speaker>
<line>Why should I think you can be mine, and true</line>
<line>(Though you in swearing shake the throned gods),</line>
<line>Who have been false to Fulvia? Riotous madness,</line>

<line offset="8">Most sweet queen&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CLEO.</speaker>
<line>Nay, pray you seek no color for your going,</line>
<line>But bid farewell, and go. When you sued staying,</line>
<line>Then was the time for words; no going then;</line>
<line>Eternity was in our lips and eyes,</line>
<line>Bliss in our brows&#8217; bent; none our parts so poor</line>
<line>But was a race of heaven. They are so still,</line>
<line>Or thou, the greatest soldier of the world,</line>

<line offset="5">How now, lady?</line>

<speech>
<speaker>CLEO.</speaker>
<line>I would I had thy inches, thou shouldst know</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANT.</speaker>
<line offset="6">Hear me, Queen:</line>
<line>The strong necessity of time commands</line>
<line>Our services awhile; but my full heart</line>
<line>Remains in use with you. Our Italy</line>
<line>Shines o&#8217;er with civil swords; Sextus Pompeius</line>
<line>Makes his approaches to the port of Rome;</line>
<line>Equality of two domestic powers</line>
<line>Breed scrupulous faction; the hated, grown to strength,</line>
<line>Are newly grown to love; the condemn&#8217;d Pompey,</line>
<line>Rich in his father&#8217;s honor, creeps apace</line>
<line>Into the hearts of such as have not thrived</line>
<line>Upon the present state, whose numbers threaten,</line>
<line>And quietness, grown sick of rest, would purge</line>
<line>By any desperate change. My more particular,</line>
<line>And that which most with you should safe my going,</line>
<line>Is Fulvia&#8217;s death.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CLEO.</speaker>
<line>Though age from folly could not give me freedom,</line>
<line>It does from childishness. Can Fulvia die?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANT.</speaker>
<line>She&#8217;s dead, my queen.</line>
<line>Look here, and at thy sovereign leisure read</line>
<line>The garboils she awak&#8217;d: at the last, best,</line>
<line>See when and where she died.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CLEO.</speaker>
<line offset="6">O most false love!</line>
<line>Where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill</line>
<line>With sorrowful water? Now I see, I see,</line>
<line>In Fulvia&#8217;s death, how mine receiv&#8217;d shall be.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>ANT.</speaker>
<line>Quarrel no more, but be prepar&#8217;d to know</line>
<line>The purposes I bear; which are, or cease,</line>
<line>As you shall give th&#8217; advice. By the fire</line>
<line>That quickens Nilus&#8217; slime, I go from hence</line>
<line>Thy soldier, servant, making peace or war</line>
<line>As thou affects.</line>

<speaker>CLEO.</speaker>
<line offset="3">Cut my lace, Charmian, come!</line>
<line>But let it be; I am quickly ill, and well,</line>
<line>So Antony loves.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>ANT.</speaker>
<line offset="4">My precious queen, forbear,</line>
<line>And give true evidence to his love, which stands</line>
<line>An honorable trial.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CLEO.</speaker>
<line offset="4">So Fulvia told me.</line>
<line>I prithee turn aside, and weep for her,</line>
<line>Then bid <french xml:lang="fr">adieu</french> to me, and say the tears</line>
<line>Belong to Egypt. Good now, play one scene</line>
<line>Of excellent dissembling, and let it look</line>
<line>Like perfect honor.</line>

<speaker>CLEO.</speaker>

<speech>
<speaker>CLEO.</speaker>
<line offset="4">&#8217;Tis sweating labor</line>
<line>To bear such idleness so near the heart</line>

<line>Eye well to you. Your honor calls you hence,</line>
<line>Therefore be deaf to my unpitied folly,</line>

<line>You may see, Lepidus, and henceforth know,</line>
<line>It is not Caesar&#8217;s natural vice to hate</line>
<line>Our great competitor. From Alexandria</line>
<line>This is the news: he fishes, drinks, and wastes</line>
<line>The lamps of night in revel; is not more manlike</line>
<line>Than Cleopatra; nor the queen of Ptolomy</line>
<line>More womanly than he; hardly gave audience, or</line>
<line>Vouchsaf&#8217;d to think he had partners. You shall find there</line>

<line>You are too indulgent. Let&#8217;s grant it is not</line>

<line>And keep the turn of tippling with a slave,</line>
<line>To reel the streets at noon, and stand the buffet</line>

<line>Call on him for&#8217;t. But to confound such time</line>
<line>That drums him from his sport and speaks as loud</line>

<speaker>1. CAES. MESS.</speaker>
<line>Thy biddings have been done, and every hour,</line>
<line>Most noble Caesar, shalt thou have report</line>
<line>How &#8217;tis abroad. Pompey is strong at sea,</line>
<line>And it appears he is belov&#8217;d of those</line>
<line>That only have fear&#8217;d Caesar; to the ports</line>
<line>The discontents repair, and men&#8217;s reports</line>
<line>Give him much wrong&#8217;d.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CAES.</speaker>
<line offset="5">I should have known no less:</line>
<line>It hath been taught us from the primal state</line>

<line>And the ebb&#8217;d man, ne&#8217;er lov&#8217;d till ne&#8217;er worth love,</line>
<line>Comes dear&#8217;d by being lack&#8217;d. This common body,</line>
<line>Like to a vagabond flag upon the stream,</line>

<stagedir>Enter Caesar&#8217;s Second Messenger.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>2. CAES. MESS.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Caesar, I bring thee word</line>
<line>Menecrates and Menas, famous pirates,</line>
<line>Makes the sea serve them, which they ear and wound</line>
<line>With keels of every kind. Many hot inroads</line>
<line>They make in Italy; the borders maritime</line>
<line>Lack blood to think on&#8217;t, and flush youth revolt.</line>
<line>No vessel can peep forth, but &#8217;tis as soon</line>
<line>Taken as seen; for Pompey&#8217;s name strikes more</line>

<line offset="6">Antony,</line>
<line>Leave thy lascivious wassails. When thou once</line>
<line>Was beaten from Modena, where thou slew&#8217;st</line>
<line>Hirtius and Pansa, consuls, at thy heel</line>
<line>Did famine follow, whom thou fought&#8217;st against</line>
<line>(Though daintily brought up) with patience more</line>
<line>Than savages could suffer. Thou didst drink</line>
<line>The stale of horses and the gilded puddle</line>
<line>Which beasts would cough at; thy palate then did deign</line>
<line>The roughest berry on the rudest hedge;</line>
<line>Yea, like the stag, when snow the pasture sheets,</line>
<line>The barks of trees thou brows&#8217;d. On the Alps</line>
<line>It is reported thou didst eat strange flesh,</line>
<line>Which some did die to look on; and all this</line>
<line>(It wounds thine honor that I speak it now)</line>
<line>Was borne so like a soldier, that thy cheek</line>

<line>Do bravely, horse, for wot&#8217;st thou whom thou mov&#8217;st?</line>
<line>The demi-Atlas of this earth, the arm</line>

<line>Or murmuring, &#8220;Where&#8217;s my serpent of old Nile?&#8221;</line>

<line>When thou wast here above the ground, I was</line>

<line>Last thing he did, dear Queen,</line>

<line>You do mistake your business, my brother never</line>

<line>Discredit my authority with yours,</line>
<line>And make the wars alike against my stomach,</line>
<line>Having alike your cause? Of this my letters</line>

<line>I will tell you.</line>
<line>The barge she sat in, like a burnish&#8217;d throne,</line>
<line>Burnt on the water. The poop was beaten gold,</line>
<line>Purple the sails, and so perfumed that</line>
<line>The winds were love-sick with them; the oars were silver,</line>
<line>Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made</line>
<line>The water which they beat to follow faster,</line>
<line>As amorous of their strokes. For her own person,</line>
<line>It beggar&#8217;d all description: she did lie</line>
<line>In her pavilion&#8212;cloth of gold, of tissue&#8212;</line>
<line>O&#8217;er-picturing that Venus where we see</line>

<line>A seeming mermaid steers; the silken tackle</line>
<line>Swell with the touches of those flower-soft hands,</line>
<line>That yarely frame the office. From the barge</line>

<stagedir>Aside.</stagedir>
<line>Thy father, Pompey, would ne&#8217;er have made this treaty.&#8212;You and I have known, sir.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ENO.</speaker>
<line>At sea, I think.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MEN.</speaker>
<line>We have, sir.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ENO.</speaker>
<line>You have done well by water.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MEN.</speaker>
<line>And you by land.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ENO.</speaker>
<line>I will praise any man that will praise me, though it cannot be denied what I have done by land.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MEN.</speaker>
<line>Nor what I have done by water.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ENO.</speaker>
<line>Yes, something you can deny for your own safety: you have been a great thief by sea.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MEN.</speaker>
<line>And you by land.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ENO.</speaker>
<line>There I deny my land service. But give me your hand, Menas; if our eyes had authority, here they might take two thieves kissing.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MEN.</speaker>
<line>All men&#8217;s faces are true, whatsome&#8217;er their hands are.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ENO.</speaker>
<line>But there is never a fair woman has a true face.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MEN.</speaker>
<line>No slander, they steal hearts.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ENO.</speaker>
<line>We came hither to fight with you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MEN.</speaker>
<line>For my part, I am sorry it is turn&#8217;d to a drinking. Pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ENO.</speaker>
<line>If he do, sure he cannot weep&#8217;t back again.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MEN.</speaker>
<line>Y&#8217; have said, sir. We look&#8217;d not for Mark Antony here. Pray you, is he married to Cleopatra?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ENO.</speaker>
<line>Caesar&#8217;s sister is call&#8217;d Octavia.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MEN.</speaker>
<line>True, sir, she was the wife of Caius Marcellus.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ENO.</speaker>
<line>But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MEN.</speaker>
<line>Pray ye, sir?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ENO.</speaker>
<line>&#8217;Tis true.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MEN.</speaker>
<line>Then is Caesar and he forever knit together.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ENO.</speaker>
<line>If I were bound to divine of this unity, I would not prophesy so.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MEN.</speaker>
<line>I think the policy of that purpose made more in the marriage than the love of the parties.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ENO.</speaker>
<line>I think so too. But you shall find the band that seems to tie their friendship together will be the very strangler of their amity. Octavia is of a holy, cold, and still conversation.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MEN.</speaker>
<line>Who would not have his wife so?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ENO.</speaker>
<line>Not he that himself is not so; which is Mark Antony. He will to his Egyptian dish again. Then shall the sighs of Octavia blow the fire up in Caesar, and (as I said before) that which is the strength of their amity shall prove the immediate author of their variance. Antony will use his affection where it is; he married but his occasion here.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MEN.</speaker>
<line>And thus it may be. Come, sir, will you aboard? I have a health for you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ENO.</speaker>
<line>I shall take it, sir; we have us&#8217;d our throats in Egypt.</line>

<line offset="5">Is it not strange, Canidius,</line>

<line>Ay, and to wage this battle at Pharsalia,</line>

<speech>
<speaker>CLEO.</speaker>
<line>Is Antony or we in fault for this?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ENO.</speaker>
<line>Antony only, that would make his will</line>
<line>Lord of his reason. What though you fled</line>
<line>From that great face of war, whose several ranges</line>
<line>Frighted each other? Why should he follow?</line>
<line>The itch of his affection should not then</line>
<line>Have nick&#8217;d his captainship, at such a point,</line>
<line>When half to half the world oppos&#8217;d, he being</line>
<line>The mered question. &#8217;Twas a shame no less</line>
<line>Than was his loss, to course your flying flags,</line>
<line>And leave his navy gazing.</line>

<line>Is that his answer?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>AMB.</speaker>
<line>Ay, my lord.</line>
</speech>

<speech>

<line>The Queen shall then have courtesy, so she</line>

<line>To the boy Caesar send this grizzled head,</line>
<line>And he will fill thy wishes to the brim</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CLEO.</speaker>
<line offset="4">That head, my lord?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANT.</speaker>
<line>To him again, tell him he wears the rose</line>
<line>Of youth upon him; from which the world should note</line>
<line>Something particular. His coin, ships, legions,</line>
<line>May be a coward&#8217;s, whose ministers would prevail</line>
<line>Under the service of a child as soon</line>
<line>As i&#8217; th&#8217; command of Caesar. I dare him therefore</line>
<line>To lay his gay comparisons apart,</line>
<line>And answer me declin&#8217;d, sword against sword,</line>
<line>Ourselves alone. I&#8217;ll write it. Follow me.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exeunt Antony and Ambassador.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>ENO.</speaker>
<stagedir>Aside.</stagedir>
<line>Yes, like enough! High-battled Caesar will</line>
<line>Unstate his happiness, and be stag&#8217;d to th&#8217; show</line>
<line>Against a sworder! I see men&#8217;s judgments are</line>
<line>A parcel of their fortunes, and things outward</line>
<line>Do draw the inward quality after them,</line>
<line>To suffer all alike. That he should dream,</line>
<line>Knowing all measures, the full Caesar will</line>
<line>Answer his emptiness! Caesar, thou hast subdu&#8217;d</line>
<line>His judgment too.</line>

<speaker>ENO.</speaker>
<stagedir>Aside.</stagedir>
<line>Mine honesty and I begin to square.</line>
<line>The loyalty well held to fools does make</line>
<line>Our faith mere folly; yet he that can endure</line>
<line>To follow with allegiance a fall&#8217;n lord</line>
<line>Does conquer him that did his master conquer,</line>
<line>And earns a place i&#8217; th&#8217; story.</line>

</speech>

<speech>

<line>So haply are they friends to Antony.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ENO.</speaker>
<line>He needs as many, sir, as Caesar has,</line>
<line>Or needs not us. If Caesar please, our master</line>
<line>Will leap to be his friend; for us, you know</line>
<line>Whose he is we are, and that is Caesar&#8217;s.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>THID.</speaker>
<line offset="8">So.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>CLEO.</speaker>
<line offset="3">He is a god and knows</line>

<speaker>ENO.</speaker>
<stagedir>Aside.</stagedir>
<line offset="4">To be sure of that,</line>

</speech>

<stagedir>Exit Enobarbus.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>THID.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Shall I say to Caesar</line>
<line>What you require of him? For he partly begs</line>
<line>To be desir&#8217;d to give. It much would please him,</line>
<line>That of his fortunes you should make a staff</line>
<line>To lean upon; but it would warm his spirits</line>

<line>And put yourself under his shroud,</line>

<line>From my cold heart let heaven engender hail,</line>

<line>My good knave Eros, now thy captain is</line>

<line>I made these wars for Egypt, and the Queen,</line>
<line>Whose heart I thought I had, for she had mine&#8212;</line>
<line>Which whilst it was mine had annex&#8217;d unto&#8217;t</line>
<line>A million more (now lost)&#8212;she, Eros, has</line>

<speaker>MAR.</speaker>
<line>Death of one person can be paid but once,</line>

<line>Then in the midst a tearing groan did break</line>

<line>With ships made cities, condemn myself to lack</line>
<line>The courage of a woman&#8212;less noble mind</line>
<line>Than she which by her death our Caesar tells,</line>
<line>&#8220;I am conqueror of myself.&#8221; Thou art sworn, Eros,</line>
<line>That when the exigent should come, which now</line>
<line>Is come indeed, when I should see behind me</line>
<line>Th&#8217; inevitable prosecution of</line>
<line>Disgrace and horror, that on my command</line>

<line>Draw that thy honest sword, which thou hast worn</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>EROS.</speaker>
<line offset="6">O, sir, pardon me!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANT.</speaker>
<line>When I did make thee free, swor&#8217;st thou not then</line>

<speech>
<speaker>ANT.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Thrice-nobler than myself!</line>
<line>Thou teachest me, O valiant Eros, what</line>

<line>A nobleness in record; but I will be</line>
<line>A bridegroom in my death, and run into&#8217;t</line>

<line>This is the brief: of money, plate, and jewels</line>
<line>I am possess&#8217;d of; &#8217;tis exactly valued,</line>

<line>Here, madam.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>CLEO.</speaker>
<line>This is my treasurer, let him speak, my lord,</line>
<line>Upon his peril, that I have reserv&#8217;d</line>
<line>To myself nothing. Speak the truth, Seleucus.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SEL.</speaker>
<line>Madam,</line>
<line>I had rather seel my lips than to my peril</line>

<line>Nay, blush not, Cleopatra, I approve</line>
<line>Your wisdom in the deed.</line>

<line offset="5">See, Caesar! O, behold,</line>
<line>How pomp is followed! Mine will now be yours,</line>
<line>And should we shift estates, yours would be mine.</line>
<line>The ingratitude of this Seleucus does</line>
<line>Even make me wild. O slave, of no more trust</line>
<line>Than love that&#8217;s hir&#8217;d! What, goest thou back? Thou shalt</line>
<line>Go back, I warrant thee; but I&#8217;ll catch thine eyes</line>
<line>Though they had wings. Slave, soulless villain, dog!</line>

<speaker>CAES.</speaker>
<line offset="3">Good Queen, let us entreat you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CLEO.</speaker>
<line>O Caesar, what a wounding shame is this,</line>
<line>That thou, vouchsafing here to visit me,</line>
<line>Doing the honor of thy lordliness</line>
<line>To one so meek, that mine own servant should</line>
<line>Parcel the sum of my disgraces by</line>
<line>Addition of his envy! Say, good Caesar,</line>
<line>That I some lady trifles have reserv&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Immoment toys, things of such dignity</line>
<line>As we greet modern friends withal, and say</line>
<line>Some nobler token I have kept apart</line>
<line>For Livia and Octavia, to induce</line>
<line>Their mediation, must I be unfolded</line>
<line>With one that I have bred? The gods! It smites me</line>
<line>Beneath the fall I have.</line>

<stagedir>To Seleucus.</stagedir>
<line offset="5">Prithee go hence,</line>
<line>Or I shall show the cinders of my spirits</line>
<line>Through th&#8217; ashes of my chance. Wert thou a man,</line>
<line>Thou wouldst have mercy on me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CAES.</speaker>
<line offset="7">Forbear, Seleucus.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit Seleucus.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>CLEO.</speaker>
<line>Be it known that we, the greatest, are misthought</line>
<line>For things that others do; and when we fall,</line>
<line>We answer others&#8217; merits in our name,</line>
<line>Are therefore to be pitied.</line>

<speaker>CAES.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Cleopatra,</line>
<line>Not what you have reserv&#8217;d, nor what acknowledg&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Put we i&#8217; th&#8217; roll of conquest. Still be&#8217;t yours,</line>
<line>Bestow it at your pleasure, and believe</line>
<line>Caesar&#8217;s no merchant, to make prize with you</line>
<line>Of things that merchants sold. Therefore be cheer&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Make not your thoughts your prisons; no, dear Queen,</line>
<line>For we intend so to dispose you as</line>
<line>Yourself shall give us counsel. Feed, and sleep.</line>

<line>You with your children will he send before.</line>
<line>Make your best use of this. I have perform&#8217;d</line>

<line offset="5">Now, Iras, what think&#8217;st thou?</line>
<line>Thou, an Egyptian puppet, shall be shown</line>
<line>In Rome as well as I. Mechanic slaves</line>
<line>With greasy aprons, rules, and hammers shall</line>
<line>Uplift us to the view. In their thick breaths,</line>
<line>Rank of gross diet, shall we be enclouded,</line>

<speech>
<speaker>IRAS.</speaker>
<line offset="7">The gods forbid!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CLEO.</speaker>
<line>Nay, &#8217;tis most certain, Iras. Saucy lictors</line>
<line>Will catch at us like strumpets, and scald rhymers</line>
<line>Ballad &#8217;s out a&#8217; tune. The quick comedians</line>
<line>Extemporally will stage us, and present</line>
<line>Our Alexandrian revels: Antony</line>
<line>Shall be brought drunken forth, and I shall see</line>
<line>Some squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatness</line>

<line>Nay, that&#8217;s certain.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IRAS.</speaker>
<line>I&#8217;ll never see&#8217;t! For I am sure mine nails</line>

<speech>
<speaker>CLEO.</speaker>
<line offset="6">Why, that&#8217;s the way</line>
<line>To fool their preparation, and to conquer</line>
<line>Their most absurd intents.</line>

<stagedir>Enter Charmian.</stagedir>
<line offset="5">Now, Charmian!</line>
<line>Show me, my women, like a queen; go fetch</line>
<line>My best attires. I am again for Cydnus</line>
<line>To meet Mark Antony. Sirrah Iras, go.</line>
<line>Now, noble Charmian, we&#8217;ll dispatch indeed,</line>
<line>And when thou hast done this chare, I&#8217;ll give thee leave</line>
<line>To play till doomsday.</line>

<stagedir>To Iras.</stagedir>

<line>Let him come in.</line>

<stagedir>Exit First Roman Guard.</stagedir>
<line offset="4">What poor an instrument</line>
<line>May do a noble deed! He brings me liberty.</line>
<line>My resolution&#8217;s plac&#8217;d, and I have nothing</line>
<line>Of woman in me; now from head to foot</line>
<line>I am marble-constant; now the fleeting moon</line>
<line>No planet is of mine.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter First Roman Guard and Clown with a basket.</stagedir>

<speaker>CLEO.</speaker>
<line>Avoid, and leave him.</line>
<stagedir>Exit First Roman Guard.</stagedir>

<line>Hast thou the pretty worm of Nilus there,</line>
<line>That kills and pains not?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CLOWN.</speaker>
<line>Truly, I have him; but I would not be the party that should desire you to touch him, for his biting is immortal; those that do die of it do seldom or never recover.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CLEO.</speaker>
<line>Remember&#8217;st thou any that have died on&#8217;t?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CLOWN.</speaker>
<line>Very many, men and women too. I heard of one of them no longer than yesterday, a very honest woman&#8212;but something given to lie, as a woman should not do but in the way of honesty&#8212;how she died of the biting of it, what pain she felt. Truly, she makes a very good report o&#8217; th&#8217; worm; but he that will believe all that they say, shall never be sav&#8217;d by half that they do. But this is most falliable, the worm&#8217;s an odd worm.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CLEO.</speaker>
<line>Get thee hence, farewell.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CLOWN.</speaker>
<line>I wish you all joy of the worm.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Setting down his basket.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>CLEO.</speaker>
<line>Farewell.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CLOWN.</speaker>
<line>You must think this, look you, that the worm will do his kind.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CLEO.</speaker>
<line>Ay, ay, farewell.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CLOWN.</speaker>
<line>Look you, the worm is not to be trusted but in the keeping of wise people; for indeed, there is no goodness in the worm.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CLEO.</speaker>
<line>Take thou no care, it shall be heeded.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CLOWN.</speaker>
<line>Very good. Give it nothing, I pray you, for it is not worth the feeding.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CLEO.</speaker>
<line>Will it eat me?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CLOWN.</speaker>
<line>You must not think I am so simple but I know the devil himself will not eat a woman. I know that a woman is a dish for the gods, if the devil dress her not. But truly, these same whoreson devils do the gods great harm in their women; for in every ten that they make, the devils mar five.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CLEO.</speaker>
<line>Well, get thee gone, farewell.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CLOWN.</speaker>
<line>Yes, forsooth; I wish you joy o&#8217; th&#8217; worm.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit.</stagedir>

<stagedir>Enter Iras with a robe, crown, etc.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>CLEO.</speaker>
<line>Give me my robe, put on my crown, I have</line>
<line>Immortal longings in me. Now no more</line>
<line>The juice of Egypt&#8217;s grape shall moist this lip.</line>
<line>Yare, yare, good Iras; quick. Methinks I hear</line>
<line>Antony call; I see him rouse himself</line>
<line>To praise my noble act. I hear him mock</line>
<line>The luck of Caesar, which the gods give men</line>
<line>To excuse their after wrath. Husband, I come!</line>
<line>Now to that name my courage prove my title!</line>
<line>I am fire and air; my other elements</line>
<line>I give to baser life. So, have you done?</line>
<line>Come then, and take the last warmth of my lips.</line>
<line>Farewell, kind Charmian, Iras, long farewell.</line>

<stagedir>Kisses them. Iras falls and dies.</stagedir>
<line>Have I the aspic in my lips? Dost fall?</line>
<line>If thou and nature can so gently part,</line>
<line>The stroke of death is as a lover&#8217;s pinch,</line>
<line>Which hurts, and is desir&#8217;d. Dost thou lie still?</line>
<line>If thus thou vanishest, thou tell&#8217;st the world</line>
<line>It is not worth leave-taking.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CHAR.</speaker>
<line>Dissolve, thick cloud, and rain, that I may say</line>
<line>The gods themselves do weep!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CLEO.</speaker>
<line offset="6">This proves me base.</line>
<line>If she first meet the curled Antony,</line>
<line>He&#8217;ll make demand of her, and spend that kiss</line>
<line>Which is my heaven to have. Come, thou mortal wretch,</line>

<stagedir>To an asp, which she applies to her breast.</stagedir>
<line>With thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate</line>
<line>Of life at once untie. Poor venomous fool,</line>
<line>Be angry, and dispatch. O, couldst thou speak,</line>
<line>That I might hear thee call great Caesar ass</line>
<line>Unpolicied!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CHAR.</speaker>
<line offset="3">O eastern star!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CLEO.</speaker>
<line offset="6">Peace, peace!</line>
<line>Dost thou not see my baby at my breast,</line>
<line>That sucks the nurse asleep?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CHAR.</speaker>
<line offset="6">O, break! O, break!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CLEO.</speaker>
<line>As sweet as balm, as soft as air, as gentle&#8212;</line>
<line>O Antony!&#8212;Nay, I will take thee too:</line>

<stagedir>Applying another asp to her arm.</stagedir>
<line>What should I stay&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Dies.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>CHAR.</speaker>
<line>In this vild world? So fare thee well!</line>
<line>Now boast thee, death, in thy possession lies</line>
<line>A lass unparallel&#8217;d. Downy windows, close,</line>
<line>And golden Phoebus never be beheld</line>
<line>Of eyes again so royal! Your crown&#8217;s awry,</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll mend it, and then play&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter the Roman Guards rustling in.</stagedir>

<line>Ah, soldier!</line>

<stagedir>Charmian dies.</stagedir>

<stagedir>Enter Dolabella.</stagedir>

</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Caesar and all his Train, marching.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>ALL.</speaker>
<line>A way there, a way for Caesar!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DOL.</speaker>
<line>O, sir, you are too sure an augurer;</line>
<line>That you did fear is done.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>CAES.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Bravest at the last,</line>
<line>She levell&#8217;d at our purposes, and being royal</line>
<line>Took her own way. The manner of their deaths?</line>
<line>I do not see them bleed.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DOL.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Who was last with them?</line>

<speech>
<speaker>1. ROM. GUARD.</speaker>
<line offset="8">O Caesar,</line>
<line>This Charmian liv&#8217;d but now, she stood and spake.</line>
<line>I found her trimming up the diadem</line>
<line>On her dead mistress; tremblingly she stood,</line>
<line>And on the sudden dropp&#8217;d.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CAES.</speaker>
<line offset="5">O noble weakness!</line>
<line>If they had swallow&#8217;d poison, &#8217;twould appear</line>
<line>By external swelling; but she looks like sleep,</line>
<line>As she would catch another Antony</line>
<line>In her strong toil of grace.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DOL.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Here, on her breast,</line>
<line>There is a vent of blood, and something blown;</line>
<line>The like is on her arm.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. ROM. GUARD.</speaker>
<line>This is an aspic&#8217;s trail, and these fig leaves</line>

<line>Upon the caves of Nile.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CAES.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Most probable</line>
<line>That so she died; for her physician tells me</line>
<line>She hath pursu&#8217;d conclusions infinite</line>
<line>Of easy ways to die. Take up her bed,</line>
<line>And bear her women from the monument.</line>
<line>She shall be buried by her Antony;</line>
<line>No grave upon the earth shall clip in it</line>
<line>A pair so famous. High events as these</line>
<line>Strike those that make them; and their story is</line>
<line>No less in pity than his glory which</line>
<line>Brought them to be lamented. Our army shall</line>
<line>In solemn show attend this funeral,</line>
<line>And then to Rome. Come, Dolabella, see</line>
