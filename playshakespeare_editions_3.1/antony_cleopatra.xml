<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I must be gone.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ENO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Under a compelling occasion, let women die. It were pity to cast them away for nothing, though between them and a great cause, they should be esteem&#8217;d nothing. Cleopatra, catching but the least noise of this, dies instantly; I have seen her die twenty times upon far poorer moment. I do think there is mettle in death, which commits some loving act upon her, she hath such a celerity in dying.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She is cunning past man&#8217;s thought.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ENO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alack, sir, no, her passions are made of nothing but the finest part of pure love. We cannot call her winds and waters sighs and tears; they are greater storms and tempests than almanacs can report. This cannot be cunning in her; if it be, she makes a show&#8217;r of rain as well as Jove.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Would I had never seen her!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ENO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, sir, you had then left unseen a wonderful piece of work, which not to have been blest withal would have discredited your travel.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fulvia is dead.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ENO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fulvia is dead.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ENO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fulvia?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Dead.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ENO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, sir, give the gods a thankful sacrifice. When it pleaseth their deities to take the wife of a man from him, it shows to man the tailors of the earth; comforting therein, that when old robes are worn out, there are members to make new. If there were no more women but Fulvia, then had you indeed a cut, and the case to be lamented. This grief is crown&#8217;d with consolation: your old smock brings forth a new petticoat, and indeed the tears live in an onion that should water this sorrow.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The business she hath broached in the state</LINE>
<LINE>Cannot endure my absence.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ENO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And the business you have broach&#8217;d here cannot be without you, especially that of Cleopatra&#8217;s, which wholly depends on your abode.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No more light answers. Let our officers</LINE>
<LINE>Have notice what we purpose. I shall break</LINE>
<LINE>The cause of our expedience to the Queen,</LINE>
<LINE>And get her leave to part. For not alone</LINE>
<LINE>The death of Fulvia, with more urgent touches,</LINE>
<LINE>Do strongly speak to us; but the letters too</LINE>
<LINE>Of many our contriving friends in Rome</LINE>
<LINE>Petition us at home. Sextus Pompeius</LINE>
<LINE>Hath given the dare to Caesar, and commands</LINE>
<LINE>The empire of the sea. Our slippery people,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose love is never link&#8217;d to the deserver</LINE>
<LINE>Till his deserts are past, begin to throw</LINE>
<LINE>Pompey the Great and all his dignities</LINE>
<LINE>Upon his son, who, high in name and power,</LINE>
<LINE>Higher than both in blood and life, stands up</LINE>
<LINE>For the main soldier; whose quality, going on,</LINE>
<LINE>The sides o&#8217; th&#8217; world may danger. Much is breeding,</LINE>
<LINE>Which, like the courser&#8217;s hair, hath yet but life,</LINE>
<LINE>And not a serpent&#8217;s poison. Say our pleasure,</LINE>
<LINE>To such whose places under us require,</LINE>
<LINE>Our quick remove from hence.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEAKER>ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">Hear me, Queen:</LINE>
<LINE>The strong necessity of time commands</LINE>
<LINE>Our services awhile; but my full heart</LINE>
<LINE>Remains in use with you. Our Italy</LINE>
<LINE>Shines o&#8217;er with civil swords; Sextus Pompeius</LINE>
<LINE>Makes his approaches to the port of Rome;</LINE>
<LINE>Equality of two domestic powers</LINE>
<LINE>Breed scrupulous faction; the hated, grown to strength,</LINE>
<LINE>Are newly grown to love; the condemn&#8217;d Pompey,</LINE>
<LINE>Rich in his father&#8217;s honor, creeps apace</LINE>
<LINE>Into the hearts of such as have not thrived</LINE>
<LINE>Upon the present state, whose numbers threaten,</LINE>
<LINE>And quietness, grown sick of rest, would purge</LINE>
<LINE>By any desperate change. My more particular,</LINE>
<LINE>And that which most with you should safe my going,</LINE>
<LINE>Is Fulvia&#8217;s death.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Though age from folly could not give me freedom,</LINE>

<LINE>Look here, and at thy sovereign leisure read</LINE>

<LINE>You may see, Lepidus, and henceforth know,</LINE>

<LINE>Our great competitor. From Alexandria</LINE>
<LINE>This is the news: he fishes, drinks, and wastes</LINE>
<LINE>The lamps of night in revel; is not more manlike</LINE>
<LINE>Than Cleopatra; nor the queen of Ptolomy</LINE>
<LINE>More womanly than he; hardly gave audience, or</LINE>
<LINE>Vouchsaf&#8217;d to think he had partners. You shall find there</LINE>
<LINE>A man who is th&#8217; abstract of all faults</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">I must not think there are</LINE>

<LINE>You are too indulgent. Let&#8217;s grant it is not</LINE>

<LINE>Call on him for&#8217;t. But to confound such time</LINE>

<LINE>Did famine follow, whom thou fought&#8217;st against</LINE>
<LINE>(Though daintily brought up) with patience more</LINE>
<LINE>Than savages could suffer. Thou didst drink</LINE>
<LINE>The stale of horses and the gilded puddle</LINE>
<LINE>Which beasts would cough at; thy palate then did deign</LINE>
<LINE>The roughest berry on the rudest hedge;</LINE>
<LINE>Yea, like the stag, when snow the pasture sheets,</LINE>
<LINE>The barks of trees thou brows&#8217;d. On the Alps</LINE>
<LINE>It is reported thou didst eat strange flesh,</LINE>
<LINE>Which some did die to look on; and all this</LINE>
<LINE>(It wounds thine honor that I speak it now)</LINE>

<LINE>How goes it with my brave Mark Antony?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Last thing he did, dear Queen,</LINE>

<LINE offset="6">&#8220;Good friend,&#8221; quoth he,</LINE>
<LINE>&#8220;Say the firm Roman to great Egypt sends</LINE>
<LINE>This treasure of an oyster; at whose foot,</LINE>
<LINE>To mend the petty present, I will piece</LINE>
<LINE>Her opulent throne with kingdoms. All the East,</LINE>
<LINE>Say thou, shall call her mistress.&#8221; So he nodded,</LINE>
<LINE>And soberly did mount an arm-gaunt steed,</LINE>
<LINE>Who neigh&#8217;d so high that what I would have spoke</LINE>

<LINE>Note him, good Charmian, &#8217;tis the man; but note him:</LINE>

<LINE>That make their looks by his; he was not merry,</LINE>
<LINE>Which seem&#8217;d to tell them his remembrance lay</LINE>
<LINE>In Egypt with his joy; but between both.</LINE>
<LINE>O heavenly mingle! Be&#8217;st thou sad or merry,</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>You do mistake your business, my brother never</LINE>
<LINE>Did urge me in his act. I did inquire it,</LINE>

<LINE>Discredit my authority with yours,</LINE>
<LINE>And make the wars alike against my stomach,</LINE>
<LINE>Having alike your cause? Of this my letters</LINE>

<LINE>I&#8217;ll play the penitent to you; but mine honesty</LINE>
<LINE>Shall not make poor my greatness, nor my power</LINE>
<LINE>Work without it. Truth is, that Fulvia,</LINE>
<LINE>To have me out of Egypt, made wars here;</LINE>

<LINE>All little jealousies, which now seem great,</LINE>

<LINE>Would then be nothing. Truths would be tales,</LINE>

<LINE>Eight wild-boars roasted whole at a breakfast, and but twelve persons there; is this true?</LINE>

<LINE>She&#8217;s a most triumphant lady, if report be square to her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ENO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>When she first met Mark Antony, she purs&#8217;d up his heart upon the river of Cydnus.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>There she appear&#8217;d indeed; or my reporter devis&#8217;d well for her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ENO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will tell you.</LINE>
<LINE>The barge she sat in, like a burnish&#8217;d throne,</LINE>
<LINE>Burnt on the water. The poop was beaten gold,</LINE>
<LINE>Purple the sails, and so perfumed that</LINE>
<LINE>The winds were love-sick with them; the oars were silver,</LINE>
<LINE>Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made</LINE>
<LINE>The water which they beat to follow faster,</LINE>
<LINE>As amorous of their strokes. For her own person,</LINE>
<LINE>It beggar&#8217;d all description: she did lie</LINE>
<LINE>In her pavilion&#8212;cloth of gold, of tissue&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>O&#8217;er-picturing that Venus where we see</LINE>
<LINE>The fancy outwork nature. On each side her</LINE>
<LINE>Stood pretty dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids,</LINE>
<LINE>With divers-color&#8217;d fans, whose wind did seem</LINE>
<LINE>To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool,</LINE>
<LINE>And what they undid did.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AGR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">O, rare for Antony!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ENO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Her gentlewomen, like the Nereides,</LINE>
<LINE>So many mermaids, tended her i&#8217; th&#8217; eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>And made their bends adornings. At the helm</LINE>
<LINE>A seeming mermaid steers; the silken tackle</LINE>
<LINE>Swell with the touches of those flower-soft hands,</LINE>
<LINE>That yarely frame the office. From the barge</LINE>
<LINE>A strange invisible perfume hits the sense</LINE>
<LINE>Of the adjacent wharfs. The city cast</LINE>
<LINE>Her people out upon her; and Antony</LINE>
<LINE>Enthron&#8217;d i&#8217; th&#8217; market-place, did sit alone,</LINE>
<LINE>Whistling to th&#8217; air, which, but for vacancy,</LINE>
<LINE>Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too,</LINE>
<LINE>And made a gap in nature.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AGR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Rare Egyptian!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ENO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Upon her landing, Antony sent to her,</LINE>
<LINE>Invited her to supper. She replied,</LINE>
<LINE>It should be better he became her guest;</LINE>
<LINE>Which she entreated. Our courteous Antony,</LINE>
<LINE>Whom ne&#8217;er the word of &#8220;No&#8221; woman heard speak,</LINE>
<LINE>Being barber&#8217;d ten times o&#8217;er, goes to the feast;</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ENO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">I saw her once</LINE>
<LINE>Hop forty paces through the public street;</LINE>

<SPEAKER>MAEC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">Now Antony</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ENO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Never, he will not:</LINE>
<LINE>Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale</LINE>
<LINE>Her infinite variety. Other women cloy</LINE>
<LINE>The appetites they feed, but she makes hungry</LINE>
<LINE>Where most she satisfies; for vildest things</LINE>
<LINE>Become themselves in her, that the holy priests</LINE>
<LINE>Bless her when she is riggish.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ENO.</SPEAKER>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ENO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If I were bound to divine of this unity, I would not prophesy so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I think the policy of that purpose made more in the marriage than the love of the parties.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ENO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I think so too. But you shall find the band that seems to tie their friendship together will be the very strangler of their amity. Octavia is of a holy, cold, and still conversation.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who would not have his wife so?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ENO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not he that himself is not so; which is Mark Antony. He will to his Egyptian dish again. Then shall the sighs of Octavia blow the fire up in Caesar, and (as I said before) that which is the strength of their amity shall prove the immediate author of their variance. Antony will use his affection where it is; he married but his occasion here.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And thus it may be. Come, sir, will you aboard? I have a health for you.</LINE>

<LINE>Praying for both parts.</LINE>
<LINE>The good gods will mock me presently,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EROS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">Ay, noble lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sometime we see a cloud that&#8217;s dragonish,</LINE>
<LINE>A vapor sometime like a bear or lion,</LINE>
<LINE>A tower&#8217;d citadel, a pendant rock,</LINE>
<LINE>A forked mountain, or blue promontory</LINE>
<LINE>With trees upon&#8217;t that nod unto the world,</LINE>
<LINE>And mock our eyes with air. Thou hast seen these signs,</LINE>
<LINE>They are black vesper&#8217;s pageants.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EROS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">Ay, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That which is now a horse, even with a thought</LINE>
<LINE>The rack dislimns, and makes it indistinct</LINE>
<LINE>As water is in water.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EROS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">It does, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My good knave Eros, now thy captain is</LINE>
<LINE>Even such a body. Here I am Antony,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet cannot hold this visible shape, my knave.</LINE>
<LINE>I made these wars for Egypt, and the Queen,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose heart I thought I had, for she had mine&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Which whilst it was mine had annex&#8217;d unto&#8217;t</LINE>
<LINE>A million more (now lost)&#8212;she, Eros, has</LINE>
<LINE>Pack&#8217;d cards with Caesar&#8217;s, and false-play&#8217;d my glory</LINE>
<LINE>Unto an enemy&#8217;s triumph.</LINE>
<LINE>Nay, weep not, gentle Eros, there is left us</LINE>
<LINE>Ourselves to end ourselves.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Mardian.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE offset="6">O, thy vild lady!</LINE>
<LINE>She has robb&#8217;d me of my sword.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">No, Antony,</LINE>
<LINE>My mistress lov&#8217;d thee, and her fortunes mingled</LINE>
<LINE>With thine entirely.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Hence, saucy eunuch, peace!</LINE>
<LINE>She hath betray&#8217;d me, and shall die the death.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Death of one person can be paid but once,</LINE>
<LINE>And that she has discharg&#8217;d. What thou wouldst do</LINE>
<LINE>Is done unto thy hand; the last she spake</LINE>
<LINE>Was &#8220;Antony, most noble Antony!&#8221;</LINE>
<LINE>Then in the midst a tearing groan did break</LINE>
<LINE>The name of Antony; it was divided</LINE>
<LINE>Between her heart and lips. She rend&#8217;red life,</LINE>
<LINE>Thy name so buried in her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Dead then?</LINE>

<LINE>Unarm, Eros, the long day&#8217;s task is done,</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>To Mardian.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE offset="4">That thou depart&#8217;st hence safe</LINE>
<LINE>Does pay thy labor richly; go.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exit Mardian.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE offset="7">Off, pluck off,</LINE>
<LINE>The sevenfold shield of Ajax cannot keep</LINE>
<LINE>The battery from my heart. O, cleave, my sides!</LINE>
<LINE>Heart, once be stronger than thy continent,</LINE>
<LINE>Crack thy frail case! Apace, Eros, apace.</LINE>
<LINE>No more a soldier. Bruised pieces, go,</LINE>
<LINE>You have been nobly borne.&#8212;From me awhile.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exit Eros.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>I will o&#8217;ertake thee, Cleopatra, and</LINE>
<LINE>Weep for my pardon. So it must be, for now</LINE>
<LINE>All length is torture; since the torch is out,</LINE>
<LINE>Lie down and stray no farther. Now all labor</LINE>
<LINE>Mars what it does; yea, very force entangles</LINE>
<LINE>Itself with strength. Seal then, and all is done.</LINE>
<LINE>Eros!&#8212;I come, my queen!&#8212;Eros!&#8212;Stay for me!</LINE>
<LINE>Where souls do couch on flowers, we&#8217;ll hand in hand,</LINE>
<LINE>And with our sprightly port make the ghosts gaze.</LINE>
<LINE>Dido and her Aeneas shall want troops,</LINE>
<LINE>And all the haunt be ours. Come, Eros, Eros!</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Eros.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EROS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What would my lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Since Cleopatra died</LINE>
<LINE>I have liv&#8217;d in such dishonor that the gods</LINE>
<LINE>Detest my baseness. I, that with my sword</LINE>
<LINE>Quarter&#8217;d the world, and o&#8217;er green Neptune&#8217;s back</LINE>
<LINE>With ships made cities, condemn myself to lack</LINE>
<LINE>The courage of a woman&#8212;less noble mind</LINE>
<LINE>Than she which by her death our Caesar tells,</LINE>
<LINE>&#8220;I am conqueror of myself.&#8221; Thou art sworn, Eros,</LINE>
<LINE>That when the exigent should come, which now</LINE>
<LINE>Is come indeed, when I should see behind me</LINE>
<LINE>Th&#8217; inevitable prosecution of</LINE>
<LINE>Disgrace and horror, that on my command</LINE>
<LINE>Thou then wouldst kill me. Do&#8217;t, the time is come.</LINE>
<LINE>Thou strik&#8217;st not me, &#8217;tis Caesar thou defeat&#8217;st.</LINE>
<LINE>Put color in thy cheek.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EROS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">The gods withhold me!</LINE>
<LINE>Shall I do that which all the Parthian darts,</LINE>
<LINE>Though enemy, lost aim and could not?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="8">Eros,</LINE>
<LINE>Wouldst thou be window&#8217;d in great Rome, and see</LINE>
<LINE>Thy master thus with pleach&#8217;d arms, bending down</LINE>
<LINE>His corrigible neck, his face subdu&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>To penetrative shame, whilst the wheel&#8217;d seat</LINE>
<LINE>Of fortunate Caesar, drawn before him, branded</LINE>
<LINE>His baseness that ensued?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EROS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">I would not see&#8217;t.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come then; for with a wound I must be cur&#8217;d.</LINE>
<LINE>Draw that thy honest sword, which thou hast worn</LINE>
<LINE>Most useful for thy country.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EROS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">O, sir, pardon me!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>When I did make thee free, swor&#8217;st thou not then</LINE>
<LINE>To do this when I bade thee? Do it at once,</LINE>
<LINE>Or thy precedent services are all</LINE>
<LINE>But accidents unpurpos&#8217;d. Draw, and come.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EROS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Turn from me then that noble countenance,</LINE>
<LINE>Wherein the worship of the whole world lies.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>The thing why thou hast drawn it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EROS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">My dear master,</LINE>
<LINE>My captain, and my emperor: let me say,</LINE>
<LINE>Before I strike this bloody stroke, farewell.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis said, man, and farewell.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EROS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Farewell, great chief. Shall I strike now?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANT.</SPEAKER>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EROS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, there then.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Kills himself.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE offset="4">Thus I do escape the sorrow</LINE>
<LINE>Of Antony&#8217;s death.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Thrice-nobler than myself!</LINE>
<LINE>Thou teachest me, O valiant Eros, what</LINE>
<LINE>I should, and thou couldst not. My queen and Eros</LINE>
<LINE>Have by their brave instruction got upon me</LINE>
<LINE>A nobleness in record; but I will be</LINE>
<LINE>A bridegroom in my death, and run into&#8217;t</LINE>
<LINE>As to a lover&#8217;s bed. Come then; and, Eros,</LINE>
<LINE>Thy master dies thy scholar: to do thus</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Falling on his sword.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>I learnt of thee. How, not dead? Not dead?</LINE>

<LINE>She had dispos&#8217;d with Caesar, and that your rage</LINE>
<LINE>Would not be purg&#8217;d, she sent you word she was dead;</LINE>

<LINE offset="4">I am call&#8217;d Decretas;</LINE>
<LINE>Mark Antony I serv&#8217;d, who best was worthy</LINE>
<LINE>Best to be serv&#8217;d. Whilst he stood up and spoke,</LINE>
<LINE>He was my master, and I wore my life</LINE>
<LINE>To spend upon his haters. If thou please</LINE>
<LINE>To take me to thee, as I was to him</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll be to Caesar; if thou pleasest not,</LINE>

<LINE>I say, O Caesar, Antony is dead.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The breaking of so great a thing should make</LINE>
<LINE>A greater crack. The round world</LINE>
<LINE>Should have shook lions into civil streets,</LINE>
<LINE>And citizens to their dens. The death of Antony</LINE>
<LINE>Is not a single doom, in the name lay</LINE>
<LINE>A moi&#8217;ty of the world.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DEC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">He is dead, Caesar,</LINE>
<LINE>Not by a public minister of justice,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor by a hired knife, but that self hand</LINE>
<LINE>Which writ his honor in the acts it did</LINE>
<LINE>Hath, with the courage which the heart did lend it,</LINE>
<LINE>Splitted the heart. This is his sword,</LINE>
<LINE>I robb&#8217;d his wound of it; behold it stain&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>With his most noble blood.</LINE>

<LINE offset="5">O Antony,</LINE>
<LINE>I have followed thee to this; but we do launch</LINE>
<LINE>Diseases in our bodies. I must perforce</LINE>
<LINE>Have shown to thee such a declining day,</LINE>
<LINE>Or look on thine; we could not stall together</LINE>
<LINE>In the whole world. But yet let me lament,</LINE>
<LINE>With tears as sovereign as the blood of hearts,</LINE>
<LINE>That thou, my brother, my competitor</LINE>
<LINE>In top of all design, my mate in empire,</LINE>
<LINE>Friend and companion in the front of war,</LINE>
<LINE>The arm of mine own body, and the heart</LINE>

<LINE>He was as rattling thunder. For his bounty,</LINE>
<LINE>There was no winter in&#8217;t; an autumn it was</LINE>
<LINE>That grew the more by reaping. His delights</LINE>
<LINE>Were dolphin-like, they show&#8217;d his back above</LINE>
<LINE>The element they liv&#8217;d in. In his livery</LINE>

<LINE>Finish, good lady, the bright day is done,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Madam, as thereto sworn by your command</LINE>
<LINE>(Which my love makes religion to obey),</LINE>
<LINE>I tell you this: Caesar through Syria</LINE>
<LINE>Intends his journey, and within three days</LINE>
<LINE>You with your children will he send before.</LINE>
<LINE>Make your best use of this. I have perform&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>Your pleasure and my promise.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">Dolabella,</LINE>

<LINE><FRENCH lang="fr">Adieu</FRENCH>, good Queen, I must attend on Caesar.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Farewell, and thanks!</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit Dolabella.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE offset="5">Now, Iras, what think&#8217;st thou?</LINE>
<LINE>Thou, an Egyptian puppet, shall be shown</LINE>
<LINE>In Rome as well as I. Mechanic slaves</LINE>
<LINE>With greasy aprons, rules, and hammers shall</LINE>
<LINE>Uplift us to the view. In their thick breaths,</LINE>
<LINE>Rank of gross diet, shall we be enclouded,</LINE>
<LINE>And forc&#8217;d to drink their vapor.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IRAS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">The gods forbid!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, &#8217;tis most certain, Iras. Saucy lictors</LINE>
<LINE>Will catch at us like strumpets, and scald rhymers</LINE>
<LINE>Ballad &#8217;s out a&#8217; tune. The quick comedians</LINE>
<LINE>Extemporally will stage us, and present</LINE>
<LINE>Our Alexandrian revels: Antony</LINE>
<LINE>Shall be brought drunken forth, and I shall see</LINE>
<LINE>Some squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatness</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217; th&#8217; posture of a whore.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IRAS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">O the good gods!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, that&#8217;s certain.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IRAS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll never see&#8217;t! For I am sure mine nails</LINE>
<LINE>Are stronger than mine eyes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">Why, that&#8217;s the way</LINE>
<LINE>To fool their preparation, and to conquer</LINE>
<LINE>Their most absurd intents.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Charmian.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE offset="5">Now, Charmian!</LINE>
<LINE>Show me, my women, like a queen; go fetch</LINE>
<LINE>My best attires. I am again for Cydnus</LINE>
<LINE>To meet Mark Antony. Sirrah Iras, go.</LINE>
<LINE>Now, noble Charmian, we&#8217;ll dispatch indeed,</LINE>
<LINE>And when thou hast done this chare, I&#8217;ll give thee leave</LINE>
<LINE>To play till doomsday.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>To Iras.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE offset="5">Bring our crown and all.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exit Iras. A noise within.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Wherefore&#8217;s this noise?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter First Roman Guard.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. ROM. GUARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Here is a rural fellow</LINE>
<LINE>That will not be denied your Highness&#8217; presence.</LINE>
<LINE>He brings you figs.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let him come in.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exit First Roman Guard.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE offset="4">What poor an instrument</LINE>
<LINE>May do a noble deed! He brings me liberty.</LINE>
<LINE>My resolution&#8217;s plac&#8217;d, and I have nothing</LINE>
<LINE>Of woman in me; now from head to foot</LINE>
<LINE>I am marble-constant; now the fleeting moon</LINE>
<LINE>No planet is of mine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter First Roman Guard and Clown with a basket.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. ROM. GUARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">This is the man.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Avoid, and leave him.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit First Roman Guard.</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>Hast thou the pretty worm of Nilus there,</LINE>
<LINE>That kills and pains not?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLOWN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Truly, I have him; but I would not be the party that should desire you to touch him, for his biting is immortal; those that do die of it do seldom or never recover.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Remember&#8217;st thou any that have died on&#8217;t?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLOWN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Very many, men and women too. I heard of one of them no longer than yesterday, a very honest woman&#8212;but something given to lie, as a woman should not do but in the way of honesty&#8212;how she died of the biting of it, what pain she felt. Truly, she makes a very good report o&#8217; th&#8217; worm; but he that will believe all that they say, shall never be sav&#8217;d by half that they do. But this is most falliable, the worm&#8217;s an odd worm.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Get thee hence, farewell.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLOWN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I wish you all joy of the worm.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Setting down his basket.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Farewell.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLOWN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You must think this, look you, that the worm will do his kind.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, ay, farewell.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLOWN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Look you, the worm is not to be trusted but in the keeping of wise people; for indeed, there is no goodness in the worm.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Take thou no care, it shall be heeded.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLOWN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Very good. Give it nothing, I pray you, for it is not worth the feeding.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Will it eat me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLOWN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You must not think I am so simple but I know the devil himself will not eat a woman. I know that a woman is a dish for the gods, if the devil dress her not. But truly, these same whoreson devils do the gods great harm in their women; for in every ten that they make, the devils mar five.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, get thee gone, farewell.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLOWN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, forsooth; I wish you joy o&#8217; th&#8217; worm.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit.</STAGEDIR>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Iras with a robe, crown, etc.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Give me my robe, put on my crown, I have</LINE>
<LINE>Immortal longings in me. Now no more</LINE>
<LINE>The juice of Egypt&#8217;s grape shall moist this lip.</LINE>
<LINE>Yare, yare, good Iras; quick. Methinks I hear</LINE>
<LINE>Antony call; I see him rouse himself</LINE>
<LINE>To praise my noble act. I hear him mock</LINE>
<LINE>The luck of Caesar, which the gods give men</LINE>
<LINE>To excuse their after wrath. Husband, I come!</LINE>
<LINE>Now to that name my courage prove my title!</LINE>
<LINE>I am fire and air; my other elements</LINE>
<LINE>I give to baser life. So, have you done?</LINE>
<LINE>Come then, and take the last warmth of my lips.</LINE>
<LINE>Farewell, kind Charmian, Iras, long farewell.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Kisses them. Iras falls and dies.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Have I the aspic in my lips? Dost fall?</LINE>
<LINE>If thou and nature can so gently part,</LINE>
<LINE>The stroke of death is as a lover&#8217;s pinch,</LINE>
<LINE>Which hurts, and is desir&#8217;d. Dost thou lie still?</LINE>
<LINE>If thus thou vanishest, thou tell&#8217;st the world</LINE>
<LINE>It is not worth leave-taking.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Dissolve, thick cloud, and rain, that I may say</LINE>
<LINE>The gods themselves do weep!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">This proves me base.</LINE>
<LINE>If she first meet the curled Antony,</LINE>
<LINE>He&#8217;ll make demand of her, and spend that kiss</LINE>
<LINE>Which is my heaven to have. Come, thou mortal wretch,</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>To an asp, which she applies to her breast.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>With thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate</LINE>
<LINE>Of life at once untie. Poor venomous fool,</LINE>
<LINE>Be angry, and dispatch. O, couldst thou speak,</LINE>
<LINE>That I might hear thee call great Caesar ass</LINE>
<LINE>Unpolicied!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="3">O eastern star!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">Peace, peace!</LINE>
<LINE>Dost thou not see my baby at my breast,</LINE>
<LINE>That sucks the nurse asleep?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">O, break! O, break!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLEO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As sweet as balm, as soft as air, as gentle&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>O Antony!&#8212;Nay, I will take thee too:</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Applying another asp to her arm.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>What should I stay&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Dies.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In this vild world? So fare thee well!</LINE>
<LINE>Now boast thee, death, in thy possession lies</LINE>
<LINE>A lass unparallel&#8217;d. Downy windows, close,</LINE>
<LINE>And golden Phoebus never be beheld</LINE>
<LINE>Of eyes again so royal! Your crown&#8217;s awry,</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll mend it, and then play&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter the Roman Guards rustling in.</STAGEDIR>

<STAGEDIR>Applies an asp.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>O, come apace, dispatch! I partly feel thee.</LINE>

<LINE>What work is here, Charmian? Is this well done?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is well done, and fitting for a princess</LINE>
<LINE>Descended of so many royal kings.</LINE>
<LINE>Ah, soldier!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Charmian dies.</STAGEDIR>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Dolabella.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">Caesar, thy thoughts</LINE>
<LINE>Touch their effects in this: thyself art coming</LINE>
<LINE>To see perform&#8217;d the dreaded act which thou</LINE>
<LINE>So sought&#8217;st to hinder.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Caesar and all his Train, marching.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A way there, a way for Caesar!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, sir, you are too sure an augurer;</LINE>
<LINE>That you did fear is done.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Bravest at the last,</LINE>
<LINE>She levell&#8217;d at our purposes, and being royal</LINE>
<LINE>Took her own way. The manner of their deaths?</LINE>
<LINE>I do not see them bleed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Who was last with them?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. ROM. GUARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A simple countryman, that brought her figs.</LINE>
<LINE>This was his basket.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Poison&#8217;d then.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. ROM. GUARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="8">O Caesar,</LINE>
<LINE>This Charmian liv&#8217;d but now, she stood and spake.</LINE>
<LINE>I found her trimming up the diadem</LINE>
<LINE>On her dead mistress; tremblingly she stood,</LINE>
<LINE>And on the sudden dropp&#8217;d.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">O noble weakness!</LINE>
<LINE>If they had swallow&#8217;d poison, &#8217;twould appear</LINE>
<LINE>By external swelling; but she looks like sleep,</LINE>
<LINE>As she would catch another Antony</LINE>
<LINE>In her strong toil of grace.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Here, on her breast,</LINE>
<LINE>There is a vent of blood, and something blown;</LINE>
<LINE>The like is on her arm.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. ROM. GUARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This is an aspic&#8217;s trail, and these fig leaves</LINE>
<LINE>Have slime upon them, such as th&#8217; aspic leaves</LINE>
<LINE>Upon the caves of Nile.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Most probable</LINE>
<LINE>That so she died; for her physician tells me</LINE>
<LINE>She hath pursu&#8217;d conclusions infinite</LINE>
<LINE>Of easy ways to die. Take up her bed,</LINE>
<LINE>And bear her women from the monument.</LINE>
<LINE>She shall be buried by her Antony;</LINE>
<LINE>No grave upon the earth shall clip in it</LINE>
<LINE>A pair so famous. High events as these</LINE>
<LINE>Strike those that make them; and their story is</LINE>
<LINE>No less in pity than his glory which</LINE>
<LINE>Brought them to be lamented. Our army shall</LINE>
<LINE>In solemn show attend this funeral,</LINE>
<LINE>And then to Rome. Come, Dolabella, see</LINE>
<LINE>High order in this great solemnity.</LINE>
