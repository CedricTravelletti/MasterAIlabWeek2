<SCENEPERSONAE>(Duke of Ephesus, Egeon, Jailer, Officers, Attendants)</SCENEPERSONAE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter the Duke of Ephesus with Egeon the merchant of Syracuse, Jailer with Officers, and other Attendants.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EGE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Proceed, Solinus, to procure my fall,</LINE>
<LINE>And by the doom of death end woes and all.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Merchant of Syracuse, plead no more.</LINE>
<LINE>I am not partial to infringe our laws;</LINE>
<LINE>The enmity and discord which of late</LINE>
<LINE>Sprung from the rancorous outrage of your Duke</LINE>
<LINE>To merchants, our well-dealing countrymen,</LINE>
<LINE>Who, wanting guilders to redeem their lives,</LINE>
<LINE>Have seal&#8217;d his rigorous statutes with their bloods,</LINE>
<LINE>Excludes all pity from our threat&#8217;ning looks:</LINE>
<LINE>For since the mortal and intestine jars</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us,</LINE>
<LINE>It hath in solemn synods been decreed,</LINE>
<LINE>Both by the Syracusians and ourselves,</LINE>
<LINE>To admit no traffic to our adverse towns:</LINE>
<LINE>Nay more, if any born at Ephesus be seen</LINE>
<LINE>At any Syracusian marts and fairs;</LINE>
<LINE>Again, if any Syracusian born</LINE>
<LINE>Come to the bay of Ephesus, he dies,</LINE>
<LINE>His goods confiscate to the Duke&#8217;s dispose,</LINE>
<LINE>Unless a thousand marks be levied</LINE>
<LINE>To quit the penalty and to ransom him.</LINE>
<LINE>Thy substance, valued at the highest rate,</LINE>
<LINE>Cannot amount unto a hundred marks,</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore by law thou art condemn&#8217;d to die.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EGE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yet this my comfort, when your words are done,</LINE>
<LINE>My woes end likewise with the evening sun.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, Syracusian; say in brief the cause</LINE>
<LINE>Why thou departedst from thy native home,</LINE>
<LINE>And for what cause thou cam&#8217;st to Ephesus.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EGE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A heavier task could not have been impos&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable:</LINE>
<LINE>Yet that the world may witness that my end</LINE>
<LINE>Was wrought by nature, not by vile offense,</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll utter what my sorrow gives me leave.</LINE>
<LINE>In Syracuse was I born, and wed</LINE>
<LINE>Unto a woman, happy but for me,</LINE>
<LINE>And by me, had not our hap been bad:</LINE>
<LINE>With her I liv&#8217;d in joy; our wealth increas&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>By prosperous voyages I often made</LINE>
<LINE>To Epidamium, till my factor&#8217;s death,</LINE>
<LINE>And the great care of goods at randon left,</LINE>
<LINE>Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse;</LINE>
<LINE>From whom my absence was not six months old</LINE>
<LINE>Before herself (almost at fainting under</LINE>
<LINE>The pleasing punishment that women bear)</LINE>
<LINE>Had made provision for her following me,</LINE>
<LINE>And soon, and safe, arrived where I was.</LINE>
<LINE>There had she not been long but she became</LINE>
<LINE>A joyful mother of two goodly sons:</LINE>
<LINE>And, which was strange, the one so like the other</LINE>
<LINE>As could not be distinguish&#8217;d but by names.</LINE>
<LINE>That very hour, and in the self-same inn,</LINE>
<LINE>A mean woman was delivered</LINE>
<LINE>Of such a burden male, twins both alike.</LINE>
<LINE>Those, for their parents were exceeding poor,</LINE>
<LINE>I bought, and brought up to attend my sons.</LINE>
<LINE>My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,</LINE>
<LINE>Made daily motions for our home return:</LINE>
<LINE>Unwilling I agreed. Alas! too soon</LINE>
<LINE>We came aboard.</LINE>
<LINE>A league from Epidamium had we sail&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>Before the always-wind-obeying deep</LINE>
<LINE>Gave any tragic instance of our harm:</LINE>
<LINE>But longer did we not retain much hope;</LINE>
<LINE>For what obscured light the heavens did grant</LINE>
<LINE>Did but convey unto our fearful minds</LINE>
<LINE>A doubtful warrant of immediate death,</LINE>
<LINE>Which though myself would gladly have embrac&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet the incessant weepings of my wife,</LINE>
<LINE>Weeping before for what she saw must come,</LINE>
<LINE>And piteous plainings of the pretty babes,</LINE>
<LINE>That mourn&#8217;d for fashion, ignorant what to fear,</LINE>
<LINE>Forc&#8217;d me to seek delays for them and me.</LINE>
<LINE>And this it was (for other means was none):</LINE>
<LINE>The sailors sought for safety by our boat,</LINE>
<LINE>And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us.</LINE>
<LINE>My wife, more careful for the latter-born,</LINE>
<LINE>Had fast&#8217;ned him unto a small spare mast,</LINE>
<LINE>Such as sea-faring men provide for storms;</LINE>
<LINE>To him one of the other twins was bound,</LINE>
<LINE>Whilst I had been like heedful of the other.</LINE>
<LINE>The children thus dispos&#8217;d, my wife and I,</LINE>
<LINE>Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Fast&#8217;ned ourselves at either end the mast,</LINE>
<LINE>And floating straight, obedient to the stream,</LINE>
<LINE>Was carried towards Corinth, as we thought.</LINE>
<LINE>At length the sun, gazing upon the earth,</LINE>
<LINE>Dispers&#8217;d those vapors that offended us,</LINE>
<LINE>And by the benefit of his wished light</LINE>
<LINE>The seas wax&#8217;d calm, and we discovered</LINE>
<LINE>Two ships from far, making amain to us,</LINE>
<LINE>Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this.</LINE>
<LINE>But ere they came&#8212;O, let me say no more!</LINE>
<LINE>Gather the sequel by that went before.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, forward, old man, do not break off so,</LINE>
<LINE>For we may pity, though not pardon thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EGE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, had the gods done so, I had not now</LINE>
<LINE>Worthily term&#8217;d them merciless to us!</LINE>
<LINE>For ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues,</LINE>
<LINE>We were encount&#8217;red by a mighty rock,</LINE>
<LINE>Which being violently borne upon,</LINE>
<LINE>Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst;</LINE>
<LINE>So that, in this unjust divorce of us,</LINE>
<LINE>Fortune had left to both of us alike</LINE>
<LINE>What to delight in, what to sorrow for.</LINE>
<LINE>Her part, poor soul! seeming as burdened</LINE>
<LINE>With lesser weight, but not with lesser woe,</LINE>
<LINE>Was carried with more speed before the wind,</LINE>
<LINE>And in our sight they three were taken up</LINE>
<LINE>By fishermen of Corinth, as we thought.</LINE>
<LINE>At length, another ship had seiz&#8217;d on us,</LINE>
<LINE>And knowing whom it was their hap to save,</LINE>
<LINE>Gave healthful welcome to their shipwrack&#8217;d guests,</LINE>
<LINE>And would have reft the fishers of their prey,</LINE>
<LINE>Had not their bark been very slow of sail;</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore homeward did they bend their course.</LINE>
<LINE>Thus have you heard me sever&#8217;d from my bliss,</LINE>
<LINE>That by misfortunes was my life prolong&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>To tell sad stories of my own mishaps.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And for the sake of them thou sorrowest for,</LINE>
<LINE>Do me the favor to dilate at full</LINE>
<LINE>What have befall&#8217;n of them and thee till now.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EGE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My youngest boy, and yet my eldest care,</LINE>
<LINE>At eighteen years became inquisitive</LINE>
<LINE>After his brother; and importun&#8217;d me</LINE>
<LINE>That his attendant&#8212;so his case was like,</LINE>
<LINE>Reft of his brother, but retain&#8217;d his name&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Might bear him company in the quest of him:</LINE>
<LINE>Whom whilst I labored of a love to see,</LINE>
<LINE>I hazarded the loss of whom I lov&#8217;d.</LINE>
<LINE>Five summers have I spent in farthest Greece,</LINE>
<LINE>Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia,</LINE>
<LINE>And coasting homeward, came to Ephesus;</LINE>
<LINE>Hopeless to find, yet loath to leave unsought</LINE>
<LINE>Or that, or any place that harbors men.</LINE>
<LINE>But here must end the story of my life,</LINE>
<LINE>And happy were I in my timely death,</LINE>
<LINE>Could all my travels warrant me they live.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hapless Egeon, whom the fates have mark&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>To bear the extremity of dire mishap!</LINE>
<LINE>Now trust me, were it not against our laws,</LINE>
<LINE>Against my crown, my oath, my dignity,</LINE>
<LINE>Which princes, would they, may not disannul,</LINE>
<LINE>My soul should sue as advocate for thee:</LINE>
<LINE>But though thou art adjudged to the death,</LINE>
<LINE>And passed sentence may not be recall&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>But to our honor&#8217;s great disparagement,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet will I favor thee in what I can;</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore, merchant, I&#8217;ll limit thee this day</LINE>
<LINE>To seek thy health by beneficial help.</LINE>
<LINE>Try all the friends thou hast in Ephesus;</LINE>
<LINE>Beg thou, or borrow, to make up the sum,</LINE>
<LINE>And live: if no, then thou art doom&#8217;d to die.</LINE>
<LINE>Jailer, take him to thy custody.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EGE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hopeless and helpless doth Egeon wend,</LINE>
<LINE>But to procrastinate his liveless end.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. E. MER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Therefore give out you are of Epidamium,</LINE>
<LINE>Lest that your goods too soon be confiscate:</LINE>
<LINE>This very day a Syracusian merchant</LINE>
<LINE>Is apprehended for arrival here;</LINE>
<LINE>And not being able to buy out his life,</LINE>
<LINE>According to the statute of the town,</LINE>
<LINE>Dies ere the weary sun set in the west.</LINE>
<LINE>There is your money that I had to keep.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go bear it to the Centaur, where we host,</LINE>
<LINE>And stay there, Dromio, till I come to thee.</LINE>
<LINE>Within this hour it will be dinner-time;</LINE>
<LINE>Till that, I&#8217;ll view the manners of the town,</LINE>
<LINE>Peruse the traders, gaze upon the buildings,</LINE>
<LINE>And then return and sleep within mine inn,</LINE>
<LINE>For with long travel I am stiff and weary.</LINE>
<LINE>Get thee away.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. DRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Many a man would take you at your word,</LINE>
<LINE>And go indeed, having so good a mean.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit Dromio.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A trusty villain, sir, that very oft,</LINE>
<LINE>When I am dull with care and melancholy,</LINE>
<LINE>Lightens my humor with his merry jests.</LINE>
<LINE>What, will you walk with me about the town,</LINE>
<LINE>And then go to my inn and dine with me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. E. MER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am invited, sir, to certain merchants,</LINE>
<LINE>Of whom I hope to make much benefit;</LINE>
<LINE>I crave your pardon. Soon at five a&#8217; clock,</LINE>
<LINE>Please you, I&#8217;ll meet with you upon the mart,</LINE>
<LINE>And afterward consort you till bed-time:</LINE>
<LINE>My present business calls me from you now.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Farewell till then. I will go lose myself,</LINE>
<LINE>And wander up and down to view the city.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. E. MER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, I commend you to your own content.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He that commends me to mine own content,</LINE>
<LINE>Commends me to the thing I cannot get:</LINE>
<LINE>I to the world am like a drop of water,</LINE>
<LINE>That in the ocean seeks another drop,</LINE>
<LINE>Who, falling there to find his fellow forth</LINE>
<LINE>(Unseen, inquisitive), confounds himself.</LINE>
<LINE>So I, to find a mother and a brother,</LINE>
<LINE>In quest of them (unhappy), ah, lose myself.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Dromio of Ephesus.</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>Here comes the almanac of my true date.</LINE>
<LINE>What now? How chance thou art return&#8217;d so soon?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>E. DRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Return&#8217;d so soon! rather approach&#8217;d too late:</LINE>
<LINE>The capon burns, the pig falls from the spit;</LINE>
<LINE>The clock hath strucken twelve upon the bell:</LINE>
<LINE>My mistress made it one upon my cheek:</LINE>
<LINE>She is so hot, because the meat is cold:</LINE>
<LINE>The meat is cold, because you come not home:</LINE>
<LINE>You come not home, because you have no stomach:</LINE>
<LINE>You have no stomach, having broke your fast:</LINE>
<LINE>But we that know what &#8217;tis to fast and pray,</LINE>
<LINE>Are penitent for your default today.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Stop in your wind, sir; tell me this, I pray:</LINE>
<LINE>Where have you left the money that I gave you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>E. DRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O&#8212;sixpence that I had a&#8217; We&#8217;n&#8217;sday last</LINE>
<LINE>To pay the saddler for my mistress&#8217; crupper?</LINE>
<LINE>The saddler had it, sir, I kept it not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am not in a sportive humor now:</LINE>
<LINE>Tell me, and dally not, where is the money?</LINE>
<LINE>We being strangers here, how dar&#8217;st thou trust</LINE>
<LINE>So great a charge from thine own custody?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>E. DRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I pray you jest, sir, as you sit at dinner.</LINE>
<LINE>I from my mistress come to you in post:</LINE>
<LINE>If I return, I shall be post indeed,</LINE>
<LINE>For she will score your fault upon my pate:</LINE>
<LINE>Methinks your maw, like mine, should be your clock,</LINE>
<LINE>And strike you home without a messenger.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, Dromio, come, these jests are out of season,</LINE>
<LINE>Reserve them till a merrier hour than this:</LINE>
<LINE>Where is the gold I gave in charge to thee?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>E. DRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To me, sir? Why, you gave no gold to me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come on, sir knave, have done your foolishness,</LINE>
<LINE>And tell me how thou hast dispos&#8217;d thy charge.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>E. DRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My charge was but to fetch you from the mart</LINE>
<LINE>Home to your house, the Phoenix, sir, to dinner;</LINE>
<LINE>My mistress and her sister stays for you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, as I am a Christian, answer me,</LINE>
<LINE>In what safe place you have bestow&#8217;d my money;</LINE>
<LINE>Or I shall break that merry sconce of yours</LINE>
<LINE>That stands on tricks when I am undispos&#8217;d:</LINE>
<LINE>Where is the thousand marks thou hadst of me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>E. DRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have some marks of yours upon my pate;</LINE>
<LINE>Some of my mistress&#8217; marks upon my shoulders;</LINE>
<LINE>But not a thousand marks between you both.</LINE>
<LINE>If I should pay your worship those again,</LINE>
<LINE>Perchance you will not bear them patiently.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thy mistress&#8217; marks? What mistress, slave, hast thou?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>E. DRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your worship&#8217;s wife, my mistress at the Phoenix;</LINE>
<LINE>She that doth fast till you come home to dinner;</LINE>
<LINE>And prays that you will hie you home to dinner.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, wilt thou flout me thus unto my face,</LINE>
<LINE>Being forbid? There, take you that, sir knave.</LINE>

<LINE>Upon my life, by some device or other</LINE>
<LINE>The villain is  o&#8217;erraught of all my money.</LINE>
<LINE>They say this town is full of cozenage:</LINE>
<LINE>As nimble jugglers that deceive the eye,</LINE>
<LINE>Dark-working sorcerers that change the mind,</LINE>
<LINE>Soul-killing witches that deform the body,</LINE>
<LINE>Disguised cheaters, prating mountebanks,</LINE>
<LINE>And many such-like liberties of sin:</LINE>
<LINE>If it prove so, I will be gone the sooner.</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll to the Centaur to go seek this slave;</LINE>

<LINE>Indu&#8217;d with intellectual sense and souls,</LINE>

<LINE>Ay, ay, he told his mind upon mine ear. Beshrew his hand, I scarce could understand it.</LINE>

<LINE>Spake he so doubtfully, thou couldst not feel his meaning?</LINE>

<LINE>Nay, he strook so plainly, I could too well feel his blows; and withal so doubtfully, that I could scarce understand them.</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>But say, I prithee, is he coming home?</LINE>

<LINE>When I desir&#8217;d him to come home to dinner,</LINE>
<LINE>He ask&#8217;d me for a thousand marks in gold:</LINE>
<LINE>&#8220;&#8217;Tis dinner-time,&#8221; quoth I: &#8220;My gold!&#8221; quoth he.</LINE>
<LINE>&#8220;Your meat doth burn,&#8221; quoth I: &#8220;My gold!&#8221; quoth he.</LINE>

<LINE>So that my arrant, due unto my tongue,</LINE>

<LINE>Hath homely age th&#8217; alluring beauty took</LINE>
<LINE>From my poor cheek? Then he hath wasted it.</LINE>
<LINE>Are my discourses dull? Barren my wit?</LINE>
<LINE>If voluble and sharp discourse be marr&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Unkindness blunts it more than marble hard.</LINE>
<LINE>Do their gay vestments his affections bait?</LINE>
<LINE>That&#8217;s not my fault, he&#8217;s master of my state.</LINE>
<LINE>What ruins are in me that can be found,</LINE>
<LINE>By him not ruin&#8217;d? Then is he the ground</LINE>

<LINE>The gold I gave to Dromio is laid up</LINE>
<LINE>Safe at the Centaur, and the heedful slave</LINE>
<LINE>Is wand&#8217;red forth, in care to seek me out.</LINE>
<LINE>By computation and mine host&#8217;s report,</LINE>
<LINE>I could not speak with Dromio since at first</LINE>
<LINE>I sent him from the mart! See, here he comes.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Dromio of Syracuse.</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>How now, sir, is your merry humor alter&#8217;d?</LINE>
<LINE>As you love strokes, so jest with me again.</LINE>
<LINE>You know no Centaur? You receiv&#8217;d no gold?</LINE>
<LINE>Your mistress sent to have me home to dinner?</LINE>
<LINE>My house was at the Phoenix? Wast thou mad,</LINE>
<LINE>That thus so madly thou didst answer me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. DRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What answer, sir? when spake I such a word?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Even now, even here, not half an hour since.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. DRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I did not see you since you sent me hence</LINE>
<LINE>Home to the Centaur with the gold you gave me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Villain, thou didst deny the gold&#8217;s receipt,</LINE>
<LINE>And toldst me of a mistress, and a dinner,</LINE>
<LINE>For which I hope thou feltst I was displeas&#8217;d.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. DRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am glad to see you in this merry vein.</LINE>
<LINE>What means this jest? I pray you, master, tell me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yea, dost thou jeer and flout me in the teeth?</LINE>
<LINE>Think&#8217;st thou I jest? Hold, take thou that, and that.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Beats Dromio.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. DRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hold, sir, for God&#8217;s sake! Now your jest is earnest,</LINE>
<LINE>Upon what bargain do you give it me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Because that I familiarly sometimes</LINE>
<LINE>Do use you for my fool, and chat with you,</LINE>
<LINE>Your sauciness will jest upon my love,</LINE>
<LINE>And make a common of my serious hours.</LINE>
<LINE>When the sun shines, let foolish gnats make sport,</LINE>
<LINE>But creep in crannies, when he hides his beams:</LINE>
<LINE>If you will jest with me, know my aspect,</LINE>
<LINE>And fashion your demeanor to my looks,</LINE>
<LINE>Or I will beat this method in your sconce.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. DRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sconce call you it? So you would leave battering, I had rather have it a head. And you use these blows long, I must get a sconce for my head, and insconce it too, or else I shall seek my wit in my shoulders. But I pray, sir, why am I beaten?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Dost thou not know?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. DRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nothing, sir, but that I am beaten.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Shall I tell you why?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. DRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, sir, and wherefore; for they say, every why hath a wherefore.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why first&#8212;for flouting me, and then wherefore&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>For urging it the second time to me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. DRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Was there ever any man thus beaten out of season,</LINE>
<LINE>When in the why and the wherefore is neither rhyme nor reason?</LINE>
<LINE>Well, sir, I thank you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thank me, sir, for what?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. DRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, sir, for this something that you gave me for nothing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll make you amends next, to give you nothing for something. But say, sir, is it dinner-time?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. DRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, sir, I think the meat wants that I have.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In good time, sir: what&#8217;s that?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. DRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Basting.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, sir, then &#8217;twill be dry.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. DRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If it be, sir, I pray you eat none of it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your reason?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. DRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Lest it make you choleric, and purchase me another dry basting.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, sir, learn to jest in good time&#8212;there&#8217;s a time for all things.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. DRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I durst have denied that before you were so choleric.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By what rule, sir?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. DRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, sir, by a rule as plain as the plain bald pate of Father Time himself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let&#8217;s hear it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. DRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There&#8217;s no time for a man to recover his hair that grows bald by nature.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>May he not do it by fine and recovery?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. DRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, to pay a fine for a periwig, and recover the lost hair of another man.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why is Time such a niggard of hair, being (as it is) so plentiful an excrement?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. DRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Because it is a blessing that he bestows on beasts, and what he hath scanted men in hair he hath given them in wit.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, but there&#8217;s many a man hath more hair than wit.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. DRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not a man of those but he hath the wit to lose his hair.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, thou didst conclude hairy men plain dealers without wit.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. DRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The plainer dealer, the sooner lost; yet he loseth it in a kind of jollity.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For what reason?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. DRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For two&#8212;and sound ones too.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, not sound, I pray you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. DRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sure ones then.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, not sure, in a thing falsing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. DRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Certain ones then.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Name them.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. DRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The one, to save the money that he spends in tiring; the other, that at dinner they should not drop in his porridge.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You would all this time have prov&#8217;d there is no time for all things.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. DRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, and did, sir: namely, e&#8217;en no time to recover hair lost by nature.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But your reason was not substantial, why there is no time to recover.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. DRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thus I mend it: Time himself is bald, and therefore, to the world&#8217;s end, will have bald followers.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I knew &#8217;twould be a bald conclusion. But soft, who wafts us yonder?</LINE>

<SPEAKER>ADR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, ay, Antipholus, look strange and frown,</LINE>
<LINE>Some other mistress hath thy sweet aspects:</LINE>
<LINE>I am not Adriana, nor thy wife.</LINE>
<LINE>The time was once, when thou unurg&#8217;d wouldst vow</LINE>
<LINE>That never words were music to thine ear,</LINE>
<LINE>That never object pleasing in thine eye,</LINE>
<LINE>That never touch well welcome to thy hand,</LINE>
<LINE>That never meat sweet-savor&#8217;d in thy taste,</LINE>
<LINE>Unless I spake, or look&#8217;d, or touch&#8217;d, or carv&#8217;d to thee.</LINE>
<LINE>How comes it now, my husband, O, how comes it,</LINE>
<LINE>That thou art then estranged from thyself?</LINE>
<LINE>Thyself I call it, being strange to me,</LINE>
<LINE>That, undividable incorporate,</LINE>
<LINE>Am better than thy dear self&#8217;s better part.</LINE>
<LINE>Ah, do not tear away thyself from me;</LINE>
<LINE>For know, my love, as easy mayst thou fall</LINE>
<LINE>A drop of water in the breaking gulf,</LINE>
<LINE>And take unmingled thence that drop again,</LINE>
<LINE>Without addition or diminishing,</LINE>
<LINE>As take from me thyself and not me too.</LINE>
<LINE>How dearly would it touch thee to the quick,</LINE>
<LINE>Shouldst thou but hear I were licentious,</LINE>
<LINE>And that this body, consecrate to thee,</LINE>
<LINE>By ruffian lust should be contaminate?</LINE>
<LINE>Wouldst thou not spit at me, and spurn at me,</LINE>
<LINE>And hurl the name of husband in my face,</LINE>
<LINE>And tear the stain&#8217;d skin off my harlot brow,</LINE>
<LINE>And from my false hand cut the wedding-ring,</LINE>
<LINE>And break it with a deep-divorcing vow?</LINE>
<LINE>I know thou canst, and therefore see thou do it.</LINE>
<LINE>I am possess&#8217;d with an adulterate blot;</LINE>
<LINE>My blood is mingled with the crime of lust:</LINE>
<LINE>For if we two be one, and thou play false,</LINE>
<LINE>I do digest the poison of thy flesh,</LINE>
<LINE>Being strumpeted by thy contagion.</LINE>
<LINE>Keep then fair league and truce with thy true bed,</LINE>
<LINE>I live dis-stain&#8217;d, thou undishonored.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Plead you to me, fair dame? I know you not:</LINE>

<SPEAKER>S. ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Did you converse, sir, with this gentlewoman?</LINE>
<LINE>What is the course and drift of your compact?</LINE>

<LINE>Villain, thou liest, for even her very words</LINE>
<LINE>Didst thou deliver to me on the mart.</LINE>

<LINE>I never spake with her in all my life.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>How can she thus then call us by our names,</LINE>
<LINE>Unless it be by inspiration?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Abetting him to thwart me in my mood!</LINE>
<LINE>Be it my wrong you are from me exempt,</LINE>
<LINE>But wrong not that wrong with a more contempt.</LINE>
<LINE>Come, I will fasten on this sleeve of thine:</LINE>
<LINE>Thou art an elm, my husband, I a vine,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose weakness, married to thy stronger state,</LINE>
<LINE>Makes me with thy strength to communicate:</LINE>
<LINE>If aught possess thee from me, it is dross,</LINE>
<LINE>Usurping ivy, brier, or idle moss,</LINE>
<LINE>Who, all for want of pruning, with intrusion</LINE>
<LINE>Infect thy sap, and live on thy confusion.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To me she speaks, she moves me for her theme:</LINE>
<LINE>What, was I married to her in my dream?</LINE>
<LINE>Or sleep I now and think I hear all this?</LINE>
<LINE>What error drives our eyes and ears amiss?</LINE>
<LINE>Until I know this sure uncertainty,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>E. ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good Signior Angelo, you must excuse us all,</LINE>
<LINE>My wife is shrewish when I keep not hours:</LINE>
<LINE>Say that I linger&#8217;d with you at your shop</LINE>
<LINE>To see the making of her carcanet,</LINE>
<LINE>And that tomorrow you will bring it home.</LINE>
<LINE>But here&#8217;s a villain that would face me down</LINE>
<LINE>He met me on the mart, and that I beat him,</LINE>
<LINE>And charg&#8217;d him with a thousand marks in gold,</LINE>
<LINE>And that I did deny my wife and house.</LINE>
<LINE>Thou drunkard, thou, what didst thou mean by this?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>E. DRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Say what you will, sir, but I know what I know:</LINE>
<LINE>That you beat me at the mart, I have your hand to show;</LINE>
<LINE>If the skin were parchment, and the blows you gave were ink,</LINE>
<LINE>Your own handwriting would tell you what I think.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>E. ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I think thou art an ass.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>E. DRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Marry, so it doth appear</LINE>
<LINE>By the wrongs I suffer, and the blows I bear.</LINE>
<LINE>I should kick, being kick&#8217;d, and being at that pass,</LINE>
<LINE>You would keep from my heels, and beware of an ass.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>E. ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Y&#8217; are sad, Signior Balthazar, pray God our cheer</LINE>
<LINE>May answer my good will and your good welcome here.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BALTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I hold your dainties cheap, sir, and your welcome dear.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>E. ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, Signior Balthazar, either at flesh or fish,</LINE>
<LINE>A table full of welcome makes scarce one dainty dish.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BALTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good meat, sir, is common; that every churl affords.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>E. ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And welcome more common, for that&#8217;s nothing but words.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BALTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Small cheer and great welcome makes a merry feast.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>E. ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, to a niggardly host and more sparing guest:</LINE>
<LINE>But though my cates be mean, take them in good part;</LINE>
<LINE>Better cheer may you have, but not with better heart.</LINE>
<LINE>But soft, my door is lock&#8217;d; go bid them let us in.</LINE>

<LINE>Mome, malt-horse, capon, cox-comb, idiot, patch!</LINE>
<LINE>Either get thee from the door, or sit down at the hatch;</LINE>
<LINE>Dost thou conjure for wenches, that thou call&#8217;st for such store,</LINE>
<LINE>When one is one too many? Go get thee from the door.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>E. DRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What patch is made our porter? My master stays in the street.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. DRO.</SPEAKER> <STAGEDIR>Within.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>E. DRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O villain, thou hast stol&#8217;n both mine office and my name:</LINE>
<LINE>The one ne&#8217;er got me credit, the other mickle blame.</LINE>
<LINE>If thou hadst been Dromio today in my place,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou wouldst have chang&#8217;d thy face for a name, or thy name for an ass.</LINE>

<LINE>By my troth, your town is troubled with unruly boys.</LINE>

<LINE>Your wife, sir knave? Go get you from the door.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>E. DRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If you went in pain, master, this knave would go sore.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANG.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here is neither cheer, sir, nor welcome: we would fain have either.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BALTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In debating which was best, we shall part with neither.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>E. DRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>They stand at the door, master, bid them welcome hither.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>E. ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There is something in the wind, that we cannot get in.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>E. DRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You would say so, master, if your garments were thin.</LINE>
<LINE>Your cake here is warm within: you stand here in the cold.</LINE>
<LINE>It would make a man mad as a buck to be so bought and sold.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>E. ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go fetch me something: I&#8217;ll break ope the gate.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEAKER>S. DRO.</SPEAKER> <STAGEDIR>Within.</STAGEDIR> 
<LINE>Break any breaking here, and I&#8217;ll break your knave&#8217;s pate.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>E. DRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A man may break a word with you, sir, and words are but wind:</LINE>
<LINE>Ay, and break it in your face, so he break it not behind.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. DRO.</SPEAKER> <STAGEDIR>Within.</STAGEDIR> 
<LINE>It seems thou want&#8217;st breaking, out upon thee, hind!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>E. DRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here&#8217;s too much &#8220;out upon thee!&#8221;; I pray thee let me in.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. DRO.</SPEAKER> <STAGEDIR>Within.</STAGEDIR> 
<LINE>Ay, when fowls have no feathers, and fish have no fin.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>E. ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, I&#8217;ll break in: go borrow me a crow.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>E. DRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A crow without feather? Master, mean you so?</LINE>
<LINE>For a fish without a fin, there&#8217;s a fowl without a feather:</LINE>
<LINE>If a crow help us in, sirrah, we&#8217;ll pluck a crow together.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>E. ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go, get thee gone, fetch me an iron crow.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BALTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Have patience, sir, O, let it not be so!</LINE>
<LINE>Herein you war against your reputation,</LINE>
<LINE>And draw within the compass of suspect</LINE>
<LINE>Th&#8217; unviolated honor of your wife.</LINE>
<LINE>Once this&#8212;your long experience of her wisdom,</LINE>
<LINE>Her sober virtue, years, and modesty,</LINE>
<LINE>Plead on her part some cause to you unknown;</LINE>
<LINE>And doubt not, sir, but she will well excuse</LINE>
<LINE>Why at this time the doors are made against you.</LINE>
<LINE>Be rul&#8217;d by me, depart in patience,</LINE>
<LINE>And let us to the Tiger all to dinner;</LINE>
<LINE>And about evening come yourself alone</LINE>
<LINE>To know the reason of this strange restraint.</LINE>
<LINE>If by strong hand you offer to break in</LINE>
<LINE>Now in the stirring passage of the day,</LINE>
<LINE>A vulgar comment will be made of it;</LINE>
<LINE>And that supposed by the common rout</LINE>
<LINE>Against your yet ungalled estimation,</LINE>
<LINE>That may with foul intrusion enter in,</LINE>
<LINE>And dwell upon your grave when you are dead;</LINE>
<LINE>For slander lives upon succession,</LINE>
<LINE>For ever hous&#8217;d where it gets possession.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>E. ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You have prevail&#8217;d. I will depart in quiet,</LINE>
<LINE>And in despite of mirth mean to be merry.</LINE>
<LINE>I know a wench of excellent discourse,</LINE>
<LINE>Pretty and witty; wild, and yet, too, gentle;</LINE>
<LINE>There will we dine. This woman that I mean,</LINE>
<LINE>My wife (but, I protest, without desert)</LINE>
<LINE>Hath oftentimes upbraided me withal:</LINE>
<LINE>To her will we to dinner.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>To Angelo.</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>Get you home</LINE>
<LINE>And fetch the chain; by this I know &#8217;tis made.</LINE>
<LINE>Bring it, I pray you, to the Porpentine,</LINE>
<LINE>For there&#8217;s the house. That chain will I bestow</LINE>
<LINE>(Be it for nothing but to spite my wife)</LINE>
<LINE>Upon mine hostess there. Good sir, make haste.</LINE>
<LINE>Since mine own doors refuse to entertain me,</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll knock elsewhere, to see if they&#8217;ll disdain me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANG.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll meet you at that place some hour hence.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>E. ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do so. This jest shall cost me some expense.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Luciana with Antipholus of Syracuse.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And may it be that you have quite forgot</LINE>
<LINE>A husband&#8217;s office? Shall, Antipholus,</LINE>
<LINE>Even in the spring of love, thy love-springs rot?</LINE>
<LINE>Shall love, in building, grow so ruinous?</LINE>
<LINE>If you did wed my sister for her wealth,</LINE>
<LINE>Then for her wealth&#8217;s sake use her with more kindness:</LINE>
<LINE>Or if you like elsewhere, do it by stealth,</LINE>
<LINE>Muffle your false love with some show of blindness:</LINE>
<LINE>Let not my sister read it in your eye;</LINE>
<LINE>Be not thy tongue thy own shame&#8217;s orator:</LINE>
<LINE>Look sweet, speak fair, become disloyalty;</LINE>
<LINE>Apparel vice like virtue&#8217;s harbinger;</LINE>
<LINE>Bear a fair presence, though your heart be tainted;</LINE>
<LINE>Teach sin the carriage of a holy saint;</LINE>
<LINE>Be secret-false: what need she be acquainted?</LINE>
<LINE>What simple thief brags of his own attaint?</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis double wrong, to truant with your bed,</LINE>
<LINE>And let her read it in thy looks at board:</LINE>
<LINE>Shame hath a bastard fame, well managed;</LINE>
<LINE>Ill deeds is doubled with an evil word.</LINE>
<LINE>Alas, poor women, make us but believe</LINE>
<LINE>(Being compact of credit) that you love us;</LINE>
<LINE>Though others have the arm, show us the sleeve:</LINE>
<LINE>We in your motion turn, and you may move us.</LINE>
<LINE>Then, gentle brother, get you in again;</LINE>
<LINE>Comfort my sister, cheer her, call her wife:</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis holy sport to be a little vain,</LINE>
<LINE>When the sweet breath of flattery conquers strife.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sweet mistress&#8212;what your name is else, I know not,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor by what wonder you do hit of mine&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Less in your knowledge and your grace you show not</LINE>
<LINE>Than our earth&#8217;s wonder, more than earth divine.</LINE>
<LINE>Teach me, dear creature, how to think and speak:</LINE>
<LINE>Lay open to my earthy gross conceit,</LINE>
<LINE>Smoth&#8217;red in errors, feeble, shallow, weak,</LINE>
<LINE>The folded meaning of your words&#8217; deceit.</LINE>
<LINE>Against my soul&#8217;s pure truth why labor you,</LINE>
<LINE>To make it wander in an unknown field?</LINE>
<LINE>Are you a god? Would you create me new?</LINE>
<LINE>Transform me then, and to your pow&#8217;r I&#8217;ll yield.</LINE>
<LINE>But if that I am I, then well I know</LINE>
<LINE>Your weeping sister is no wife of mine,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor to her bed no homage do I owe:</LINE>
<LINE>Far more, far more, to you do I decline.</LINE>
<LINE>O, train me not, sweet mermaid, with thy note,</LINE>
<LINE>To drown me in thy sister&#8217;s flood of tears.</LINE>
<LINE>Sing, siren, for thyself, and I will dote;</LINE>
<LINE>Spread  o&#8217;er the silver waves thy golden hairs,</LINE>
<LINE>And as a bed I&#8217;ll take them, and there lie,</LINE>
<LINE>And in that glorious supposition think</LINE>
<LINE>He gains by death that hath such means to die:</LINE>
<LINE>Let Love, being light, be drowned if she sink!</LINE>

<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, are you mad, that you do reason so?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not mad, but mated&#8212;how, I do not know.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is a fault that springeth from your eye.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For gazing on your beams, fair sun, being by.</LINE>

<LINE>Gaze when you should, and that will clear your sight.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE offset="8">No;</LINE>
<LINE>It is thyself, mine own self&#8217;s better part:</LINE>
<LINE>Mine eye&#8217;s clear eye, my dear heart&#8217;s dearer heart,</LINE>
<LINE>My food, my fortune, and my sweet hope&#8217;s aim,</LINE>
<LINE>My sole earth&#8217;s heaven, and my heaven&#8217;s claim.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, how now, Dromio, where run&#8217;st thou so fast?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. DRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do you know me, sir? Am I Dromio? Am I your man? Am I myself?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou art Dromio, thou art my man, thou art thyself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. DRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am an ass, I am a woman&#8217;s man, and besides myself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What woman&#8217;s man, and how besides thyself?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. DRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, sir, besides myself, I am due to a woman: one that claims me, one that haunts me, one that will have me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What claim lays she to thee?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. DRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, sir, such claim as you would lay to your horse, and she would have me as a beast; not that, I being a beast, she would have me, but that she, being a very beastly creature, lays claim to me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What is she?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. DRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A very reverent body: ay, such a one as a man may not speak of without he say &#8220;Sir-reverence.&#8221; I have but lean luck in the match, and yet is she a wondrous fat marriage.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How dost thou mean a fat marriage?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. DRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, sir, she&#8217;s the kitchen wench and all grease, and I know not what use to put her to but to make a lamp of her and run from her by her own light. I warrant, her rags and the tallow in them will burn a Poland winter: if she lives till doomsday, she&#8217;ll burn a week longer than the whole world.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What complexion is she of?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. DRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Swart, like my shoe, but her face nothing like so clean kept: for why? she sweats, a man may go over shoes in the grime of it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That&#8217;s a fault that water will mend.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. DRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, sir, &#8217;tis in grain, Noah&#8217;s flood could not do it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What&#8217;s her name?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. DRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nell, sir; but her name and three quarters, that&#8217;s an ell and three quarters, will not measure her from hip to hip.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then she bears some breadth?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. DRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No longer from head to foot than from hip to hip: she is spherical, like a globe; I could find out countries in her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In what part of her body stands Ireland?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. DRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, sir, in her buttocks, I found it out by the bogs.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Where Scotland?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. DRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I found it by the barrenness, hard in the palm of the hand.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Where France?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. DRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In her forehead, arm&#8217;d and reverted, making war against her heir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Where England?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. DRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I look&#8217;d for the chalky cliffs, but I could find no whiteness in them. But I guess, it stood in her chin, by the salt rheum that ran between France and it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Where Spain?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. DRO.</SPEAKER>

<LINE>O, sir, upon her nose, all  o&#8217;er embellish&#8217;d with rubies, carbuncles, sapphires, declining their rich aspect to the hot breath of Spain, who sent whole armadoes of carrects to be ballast at her nose.</LINE>

<LINE>Where stood Belgia, the Netherlands?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. DRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, sir, I did not look so low. To conclude, this drudge or diviner laid claim to me, call&#8217;d me Dromio, swore I was assur&#8217;d to her, told me what privy marks I had about me, as the mark of my shoulder, the mole in my neck, the great wart on my left arm, that I, amaz&#8217;d, ran from her as a witch.</LINE>
<LINE>And I think, if my breast had not been made of faith, and my heart of steel,</LINE>
<LINE>She had transform&#8217;d me to a curtal dog, and made me turn i&#8217; th&#8217; wheel.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>S. ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go hie thee presently, post to the road,</LINE>
<LINE>And if the wind blow any way from shore,</LINE>
<LINE>I will not harbor in this town tonight.</LINE>
<LINE>If any bark put forth, come to the mart,</LINE>
<LINE>Where I will walk till thou return to me.</LINE>
<LINE>If every one knows us, and we know none,</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis time, I think, to trudge, pack, and be gone.</LINE>

<LINE>Doth for a wife abhor. But her fair sister,</LINE>
<LINE>Possess&#8217;d with such a gentle sovereign grace,</LINE>
<LINE>Of such enchanting presence and discourse,</LINE>
<LINE>Hath almost made me traitor to myself;</LINE>
<LINE>But lest myself be guilty to self-wrong,</LINE>

<LINE>If it were chain&#8217;d together, and therefore came not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANG.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Saving your merry humor, here&#8217;s the note</LINE>
<LINE>How much your chain weighs to the utmost charect,</LINE>
<LINE>The fineness of the gold, and chargeful fashion,</LINE>
<LINE>Which doth amount to three odd ducats more</LINE>
<LINE>Than I stand debted to this gentleman.</LINE>
<LINE>I pray you see him presently discharg&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>For he is bound to sea, and stays but for it.</LINE>

<LINE>I am not furnish&#8217;d with the present money:</LINE>
<LINE>Besides, I have some business in the town.</LINE>
<LINE>Good signior, take the stranger to my house,</LINE>

<LINE>Disburse the sum on the receipt thereof.</LINE>
<LINE>Perchance I will be there as soon as you.</LINE>

<LINE>Hold, hurt him not for God sake! he is mad.</LINE>
<LINE>Some get within him, take his sword away:</LINE>

<SPEAKER>2. E. MER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am sorry now that I did draw on him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ABB.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How long hath this possession held the man?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ADR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This week he hath been heavy, sour, sad,</LINE>
<LINE>And much different from the man he was;</LINE>
<LINE>But till this afternoon his passion</LINE>
<LINE>Ne&#8217;er brake into extremity of rage.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ABB.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hath he not lost much wealth by wrack of sea?</LINE>
<LINE>Buried some dear friend? Hath not else his eye</LINE>
<LINE>Stray&#8217;d his affection in unlawful love&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>A sin prevailing much in youthful men,</LINE>
<LINE>Who give their eyes the liberty of gazing?</LINE>
<LINE>Which of these sorrows is he subject to?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ADR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To none of these, except it be the last,</LINE>
<LINE>Namely, some love that drew him oft from home.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ABB.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You should for that have reprehended him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ADR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, so I did.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ABB.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="3">Ay, but not rough enough.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ADR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As roughly as my modesty would let me.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ABB.</SPEAKER>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ADR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">And in assemblies too.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ABB.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, but not enough.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ADR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It was the copy of our conference:</LINE>
<LINE>In bed he slept not for my urging it;</LINE>
<LINE>At board he fed not for my urging it;</LINE>
<LINE>Alone, it was the subject of my theme;</LINE>
<LINE>In company I often glanced it;</LINE>
<LINE>Still did I tell him it was vild and bad.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ABB.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And thereof came it that the man was mad.</LINE>
<LINE>The venom clamors of a jealous woman</LINE>
<LINE>Poisons more deadly than a mad dog&#8217;s tooth.</LINE>
<LINE>It seems his sleeps were hind&#8217;red by thy railing,</LINE>
<LINE>And thereof comes it that his head is light.</LINE>
<LINE>Thou say&#8217;st his meat was sauc&#8217;d with thy upbraidings:</LINE>
<LINE>Unquiet meals make ill digestions,</LINE>
<LINE>Thereof the raging fire of fever bred,</LINE>
<LINE>And what&#8217;s a fever but a fit of madness?</LINE>
<LINE>Thou say&#8217;st his sports were hind&#8217;red by thy brawls:</LINE>
<LINE>Sweet recreation barr&#8217;d, what doth ensue</LINE>
<LINE>But moody and dull melancholy,</LINE>
<LINE>Kinsman to grim and comfortless despair,</LINE>
<LINE>And at her heels a huge infectious troop</LINE>
<LINE>Of pale distemperatures and foes to life?</LINE>
<LINE>In food, in sport, and life-preserving rest</LINE>
<LINE>To be disturb&#8217;d, would mad or man or beast:</LINE>
<LINE>The consequence is then, thy jealous fits</LINE>
<LINE>Hath scar&#8217;d thy husband from the use of wits.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She never reprehended him but mildly,</LINE>
<LINE>When he demean&#8217;d himself rough, rude, and wildly.</LINE>
<LINE>Why bear you these rebukes, and answer not?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ADR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She did betray me to my own reproof.</LINE>
<LINE>Good people, enter and lay hold on him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ABB.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, not a creature enters in my house.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ADR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then let your servants bring my husband forth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ABB.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Neither. He took this place for sanctuary,</LINE>
<LINE>And it shall privilege him from your hands</LINE>
<LINE>Till I have brought him to his wits again,</LINE>
<LINE>Or lose my labor in assaying it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ADR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will attend my husband, be his nurse,</LINE>
<LINE>Diet his sickness, for it is my office,</LINE>
<LINE>And will have no attorney but myself,</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore let me have him home with me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ABB.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Be patient, for I will not let him stir</LINE>
<LINE>Till I have us&#8217;d the approved means I have,</LINE>
<LINE>With wholesome syrups, drugs, and holy prayers,</LINE>
<LINE>To make of him a formal man again:</LINE>
<LINE>It is a branch and parcel of mine oath,</LINE>
<LINE>A charitable duty of my order,</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore depart, and leave him here with me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ADR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will not hence, and leave my husband here;</LINE>
<LINE>And ill it doth beseem your holiness</LINE>
<LINE>To separate the husband and the wife.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ABB.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Be quiet and depart, thou shalt not have him.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>ADR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come go: I will fall prostrate at his feet,</LINE>
<LINE>And never rise until my tears and prayers</LINE>
<LINE>Have won his Grace to come in person hither,</LINE>
<LINE>And take perforce my husband from the abbess.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. E. MER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By this I think the dial points at five.</LINE>
<LINE>Anon I&#8217;m sure the Duke himself in person</LINE>
<LINE>Comes this way to the melancholy vale,</LINE>
<LINE>The place of death and sorry execution,</LINE>
<LINE>Behind the ditches of the abbey here.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANG.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Upon what cause?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. E. MER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To see a reverent Syracusian merchant,</LINE>
<LINE>Who put unluckily into this bay</LINE>
<LINE>Against the laws and statutes of this town,</LINE>
<LINE>Beheaded publicly for his offense.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yet once again proclaim it publicly,</LINE>
<LINE>If any friend will pay the sum for him,</LINE>
<LINE>He shall not die, so much we tender him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ADR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Justice, most sacred Duke, against the abbess!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She is a virtuous and a reverend lady,</LINE>
<LINE>It cannot be that she hath done thee wrong.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ADR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>May it please your Grace, Antipholus my husband,</LINE>
<LINE>Who I made lord of me and all I had,</LINE>
<LINE>At your important letters&#8212;this ill day</LINE>
<LINE>A most outrageous fit of madness took him,</LINE>
<LINE>That desp&#8217;rately he hurried through the street&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>With him his bondman, all as mad as he&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Doing displeasure to the citizens</LINE>
<LINE>By rushing in their houses, bearing thence</LINE>
<LINE>Rings, jewels, any thing his rage did like.</LINE>
<LINE>Once did I get him bound, and sent him home,</LINE>
<LINE>Whilst to take order for the wrongs I went,</LINE>
<LINE>That here and there his fury had committed.</LINE>
<LINE>Anon, I wot not by what strong escape,</LINE>
<LINE>He broke from those that had the guard of him,</LINE>
<LINE>And with his mad attendant and himself,</LINE>
<LINE>Each one with ireful passion, with drawn swords,</LINE>
<LINE>Met us again, and madly bent on us</LINE>
<LINE>Chas&#8217;d us away; till raising of more aid,</LINE>
<LINE>We came again to bind them. Then they fled</LINE>
<LINE>Into this abbey, whither we pursu&#8217;d them,</LINE>
<LINE>And here the abbess shuts the gates on us,</LINE>
<LINE>And will not suffer us to fetch him out,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor send him forth, that we may bear him hence.</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore, most gracious Duke, with thy command</LINE>
<LINE>Let him be brought forth, and borne hence for help.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Long since thy husband serv&#8217;d me in my wars,</LINE>
<LINE>And I to thee engag&#8217;d a prince&#8217;s word,</LINE>
<LINE>When thou didst make him master of thy bed,</LINE>
<LINE>To do him all the grace and good I could.</LINE>
<LINE>Go some of you, knock at the abbey-gate,</LINE>
<LINE>And bid the Lady Abbess come to me:</LINE>
<LINE>I will determine this before I stir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter a Messenger.</STAGEDIR>


<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MESS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O mistress, mistress, shift and save yourself!</LINE>
<LINE>My master and his man are both broke loose,</LINE>
<LINE>Beaten the maids a-row, and bound the doctor,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose beard they have sing&#8217;d off with brands of fire,</LINE>
<LINE>And ever as it blaz&#8217;d, they threw on him</LINE>
<LINE>Great pails of puddled mire to quench the hair;</LINE>
<LINE>My master preaches patience to him, and the while</LINE>
<LINE>His man with scissors nicks him like a fool;</LINE>
<LINE>And sure (unless you send some present help)</LINE>
<LINE>Between them they will kill the conjurer.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ADR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Peace, fool, thy master and his man are here,</LINE>
<LINE>And that is false thou dost report to us.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MESS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Mistress, upon my life, I tell you true;</LINE>
<LINE>I have not breath&#8217;d almost since I did see it.</LINE>
<LINE>He cries for you, and vows, if he can take you,</LINE>
<LINE>To scorch your face, and to disfigure you.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Cry within.</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>Hark, hark, I hear him, mistress; fly, be gone!</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ADR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay me, it is my husband! Witness you,</LINE>
<LINE>That he is borne about invisible:</LINE>
<LINE>Even now we hous&#8217;d him in the abbey here,</LINE>
<LINE>And now he&#8217;s there, past thought of human reason.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Antipholus of Ephesus and Dromio of Ephesus.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>E. ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Justice, most gracious Duke, O, grant me justice,</LINE>
<LINE>Even for the service that long since I did thee,</LINE>
<LINE>When I bestrid thee in the wars, and took</LINE>
<LINE>Deep scars to save thy life; even for the blood</LINE>
<LINE>That then I lost for thee, now grant me justice.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EGE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Unless the fear of death doth make me dote,</LINE>
<LINE>I see my son Antipholus and Dromio.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>E. ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Justice, sweet prince, against that woman there!</LINE>
<LINE>She whom thou gav&#8217;st to me to be my wife;</LINE>
<LINE>That hath abused and dishonored me,</LINE>
<LINE>Even in the strength and height of injury:</LINE>
<LINE>Beyond imagination is the wrong</LINE>
<LINE>That she this day hath shameless thrown on me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Discover how, and thou shalt find me just.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>E. ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This day, great Duke, she shut the doors upon me,</LINE>
<LINE>While she with harlots feasted in my house.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A grievous fault! Say, woman, didst thou so?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ADR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, my good lord. Myself, he, and my sister</LINE>
<LINE>Today did dine together: so befall my soul</LINE>
<LINE>As this is false he burdens me withal!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ne&#8217;er may I look on day, nor sleep on night,</LINE>
<LINE>But she tells to your Highness simple truth!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANG.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O perjur&#8217;d woman! They are both forsworn:</LINE>
<LINE>In this the madman justly chargeth them.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>E. ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My liege, I am advised what I say,</LINE>
<LINE>Neither disturbed with the effect of wine,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor heady-rash, provok&#8217;d with raging ire,</LINE>
<LINE>Albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad.</LINE>
<LINE>This woman lock&#8217;d me out this day from dinner;</LINE>
<LINE>That goldsmith there, were he not pack&#8217;d with her,</LINE>
<LINE>Could witness it, for he was with me then,</LINE>
<LINE>Who parted with me to go fetch a chain,</LINE>
<LINE>Promising to bring it to the Porpentine,</LINE>
<LINE>Where Balthazar and I did dine together.</LINE>
<LINE>Our dinner done, and he not coming thither,</LINE>
<LINE>I went to seek him. In the street I met him,</LINE>
<LINE>And in his company that gentleman.</LINE>
<LINE>There did this perjur&#8217;d goldsmith swear me down</LINE>
<LINE>That I this day of him receiv&#8217;d the chain,</LINE>
<LINE>Which, God he knows, I saw not; for the which</LINE>
<LINE>He did arrest me with an officer.</LINE>
<LINE>I did obey, and sent my peasant home</LINE>
<LINE>For certain ducats; he with none return&#8217;d.</LINE>
<LINE>Then fairly I bespoke the officer</LINE>
<LINE>To go in person with me to my house.</LINE>
<LINE>By th&#8217; way we met</LINE>
<LINE>My wife, her sister, and a rabble more</LINE>
<LINE>Of vild confederates. Along with them</LINE>
<LINE>They brought one Pinch, a hungry lean-fac&#8217;d villain,</LINE>
<LINE>A mere anatomy, a mountebank,</LINE>
<LINE>A threadbare juggler and a fortune-teller,</LINE>
<LINE>A needy, hollow-ey&#8217;d, sharp-looking wretch,</LINE>
<LINE>A living dead man. This pernicious slave,</LINE>
<LINE>Forsooth, took on him as a conjurer,</LINE>
<LINE>And gazing in mine eyes, feeling my pulse,</LINE>
<LINE>And with no face, as &#8217;twere, outfacing me,</LINE>
<LINE>Cries out, I was possess&#8217;d. Then all together</LINE>
<LINE>They fell upon me, bound me, bore me thence,</LINE>
<LINE>And in a dark and dankish vault at home</LINE>
<LINE>There left me and my man, both bound together,</LINE>
<LINE>Till gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder,</LINE>
<LINE>I gain&#8217;d my freedom; and immediately</LINE>
<LINE>Ran hither to your Grace, whom I beseech</LINE>
<LINE>To give me ample satisfaction</LINE>
<LINE>For these deep shames and great indignities.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANG.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, in truth, thus far I witness with him:</LINE>
<LINE>That he din&#8217;d not at home, but was lock&#8217;d out.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But had he such a chain of thee, or no?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANG.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He had, my lord, and when he ran in here,</LINE>
<LINE>These people saw the chain about his neck.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. E. MER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Besides, I will be sworn these ears of mine</LINE>
<LINE>Heard you confess you had the chain of him,</LINE>
<LINE>After you first forswore it on the mart,</LINE>
<LINE>And thereupon I drew my sword on you;</LINE>
<LINE>And then you fled into this abbey here,</LINE>
<LINE>From whence I think you are come by miracle.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>E. ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I never came within these abbey walls,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor ever didst thou draw thy sword on me;</LINE>
<LINE>I never saw the chain, so help me heaven;</LINE>
<LINE>And this is false you burden me withal.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, what an intricate impeach is this!</LINE>
<LINE>I think you all have drunk of Circe&#8217;s cup.</LINE>
<LINE>If here you hous&#8217;d him, here he would have been;</LINE>
<LINE>If he were mad, he would not plead so coldly.</LINE>
<LINE>You say he din&#8217;d at home; the goldsmith here</LINE>
<LINE>Denies that saying. Sirrah, what say you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>E. DRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, he din&#8217;d with her there, at the Porpentine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He did, and from my finger snatch&#8217;d that ring.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>E. ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis true, my liege, this ring I had of her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Saw&#8217;st thou him enter at the abbey here?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As sure, my liege, as I do see your Grace.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, this is strange. Go call the abbess hither.</LINE>
<LINE>I think you are all mated, or stark mad.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit one to the abbess.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EGE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Most mighty Duke, vouchsafe me speak a word:</LINE>
<LINE>Haply I see a friend will save my life,</LINE>

<LINE>Within this hour I was his bondman, sir,</LINE>
<LINE>But he, I thank him, gnaw&#8217;d in two my cords:</LINE>
<LINE>Now am I Dromio, and his man, unbound.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EGE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am sure you both of you remember me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>E. DRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ourselves we do remember, sir, by you;</LINE>
<LINE>For lately we were bound as you are now.</LINE>
<LINE>You are not Pinch&#8217;s patient, are you, sir?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EGE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why look you strange on me? You know me well.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EGE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O! grief hath chang&#8217;d me since you saw me last,</LINE>
<LINE>And careful hours with time&#8217;s deformed hand</LINE>
<LINE>Have written strange defeatures in my face:</LINE>
<LINE>But tell me yet, dost thou not know my voice?</LINE>

<LINE>I am sure thou dost!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>E. DRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, sir, but I am sure I do not&#8212;and whatsoever a man denies, you are now bound to believe him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EGE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not know my voice! O time&#8217;s extremity,</LINE>
<LINE>Hast thou so crack&#8217;d and splitted my poor tongue</LINE>
<LINE>In seven short years, that here my only son</LINE>
<LINE>Knows not my feeble key of untun&#8217;d cares?</LINE>
<LINE>Though now this grained face of mine be hid</LINE>
<LINE>In sap-consuming winter&#8217;s drizzled snow,</LINE>
<LINE>And all the conduits of my blood froze up,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet hath my night of life some memory,</LINE>
<LINE>My wasting lamps some fading glimmer left,</LINE>

<LINE>All these old witnesses&#8212;I cannot err&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Tell me thou art my son Antipholus.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>E. ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I never saw my father in my life.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>EGE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But seven years since, in Syracuse, boy,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou know&#8217;st we parted, but perhaps, my son,</LINE>

<SPEAKER>E. ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The Duke, and all that know me in the city,</LINE>
