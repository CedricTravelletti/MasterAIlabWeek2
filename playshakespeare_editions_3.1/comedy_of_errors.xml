<scenepersonae>(Duke of Ephesus, Egeon, Jailer, Officers, Attendants)</scenepersonae>

<stagedir>Enter the Duke of Ephesus with Egeon the merchant of Syracuse, Jailer with Officers, and other Attendants.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>EGE.</speaker>
<line>Proceed, Solinus, to procure my fall,</line>
<line>And by the doom of death end woes and all.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
<line>Merchant of Syracuse, plead no more.</line>
<line>I am not partial to infringe our laws;</line>
<line>The enmity and discord which of late</line>
<line>Sprung from the rancorous outrage of your Duke</line>
<line>To merchants, our well-dealing countrymen,</line>
<line>Who, wanting guilders to redeem their lives,</line>
<line>Have seal&#8217;d his rigorous statutes with their bloods,</line>
<line>Excludes all pity from our threat&#8217;ning looks:</line>
<line>For since the mortal and intestine jars</line>
<line>&#8217;Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us,</line>
<line>It hath in solemn synods been decreed,</line>
<line>Both by the Syracusians and ourselves,</line>
<line>To admit no traffic to our adverse towns:</line>
<line>Nay more, if any born at Ephesus be seen</line>
<line>At any Syracusian marts and fairs;</line>
<line>Again, if any Syracusian born</line>
<line>Come to the bay of Ephesus, he dies,</line>
<line>His goods confiscate to the Duke&#8217;s dispose,</line>
<line>Unless a thousand marks be levied</line>
<line>To quit the penalty and to ransom him.</line>
<line>Thy substance, valued at the highest rate,</line>
<line>Cannot amount unto a hundred marks,</line>
<line>Therefore by law thou art condemn&#8217;d to die.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>EGE.</speaker>
<line>Yet this my comfort, when your words are done,</line>
<line>My woes end likewise with the evening sun.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
<line>Well, Syracusian; say in brief the cause</line>
<line>Why thou departedst from thy native home,</line>
<line>And for what cause thou cam&#8217;st to Ephesus.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>EGE.</speaker>
<line>A heavier task could not have been impos&#8217;d</line>
<line>Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable:</line>
<line>Yet that the world may witness that my end</line>
<line>Was wrought by nature, not by vile offense,</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll utter what my sorrow gives me leave.</line>
<line>In Syracuse was I born, and wed</line>
<line>Unto a woman, happy but for me,</line>
<line>And by me, had not our hap been bad:</line>
<line>With her I liv&#8217;d in joy; our wealth increas&#8217;d</line>
<line>By prosperous voyages I often made</line>
<line>To Epidamium, till my factor&#8217;s death,</line>
<line>And the great care of goods at random left,</line>
<line>Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse;</line>
<line>From whom my absence was not six months old</line>
<line>Before herself (almost at fainting under</line>
<line>The pleasing punishment that women bear)</line>
<line>Had made provision for her following me,</line>
<line>And soon, and safe, arrived where I was.</line>
<line>There had she not been long but she became</line>
<line>A joyful mother of two goodly sons:</line>
<line>And, which was strange, the one so like the other</line>
<line>As could not be distinguish&#8217;d but by names.</line>
<line>That very hour, and in the self-same inn,</line>
<line>A mean woman was delivered</line>
<line>Of such a burden male, twins both alike.</line>
<line>Those, for their parents were exceeding poor,</line>
<line>I bought, and brought up to attend my sons.</line>
<line>My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,</line>
<line>Made daily motions for our home return:</line>
<line>Unwilling I agreed. Alas! Too soon</line>
<line>We came aboard.</line>
<line>A league from Epidamium had we sail&#8217;d</line>
<line>Before the always-wind-obeying deep</line>
<line>Gave any tragic instance of our harm:</line>
<line>But longer did we not retain much hope;</line>
<line>For what obscured light the heavens did grant</line>
<line>Did but convey unto our fearful minds</line>
<line>A doubtful warrant of immediate death,</line>
<line>Which though myself would gladly have embrac&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Yet the incessant weepings of my wife,</line>
<line>Weeping before for what she saw must come,</line>
<line>And piteous plainings of the pretty babes,</line>
<line>That mourn&#8217;d for fashion, ignorant what to fear,</line>
<line>Forc&#8217;d me to seek delays for them and me.</line>
<line>And this it was (for other means was none):</line>
<line>The sailors sought for safety by our boat,</line>
<line>And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us.</line>
<line>My wife, more careful for the latter-born,</line>
<line>Had fast&#8217;ned him unto a small spare mast,</line>
<line>Such as sea-faring men provide for storms;</line>
<line>To him one of the other twins was bound,</line>
<line>Whilst I had been like heedful of the other.</line>
<line>The children thus dispos&#8217;d, my wife and I,</line>
<line>Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Fast&#8217;ned ourselves at either end the mast,</line>
<line>And floating straight, obedient to the stream,</line>
<line>Was carried towards Corinth, as we thought.</line>
<line>At length the sun, gazing upon the earth,</line>
<line>Dispers&#8217;d those vapors that offended us,</line>
<line>And by the benefit of his wished light</line>
<line>The seas wax&#8217;d calm, and we discovered</line>
<line>Two ships from far, making amain to us,</line>
<line>Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this.</line>
<line>But ere they came&#8212;O, let me say no more!</line>
<line>Gather the sequel by that went before.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
<line>Nay, forward, old man, do not break off so,</line>
<line>For we may pity, though not pardon thee.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>EGE.</speaker>
<line>O, had the gods done so, I had not now</line>
<line>Worthily term&#8217;d them merciless to us!</line>
<line>For ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues,</line>
<line>We were encount&#8217;red by a mighty rock,</line>
<line>Which being violently borne upon,</line>
<line>Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst;</line>
<line>So that, in this unjust divorce of us,</line>
<line>Fortune had left to both of us alike</line>
<line>What to delight in, what to sorrow for.</line>
<line>Her part, poor soul! Seeming as burdened</line>
<line>With lesser weight, but not with lesser woe,</line>
<line>Was carried with more speed before the wind,</line>
<line>And in our sight they three were taken up</line>
<line>By fishermen of Corinth, as we thought.</line>
<line>At length, another ship had seiz&#8217;d on us,</line>
<line>And knowing whom it was their hap to save,</line>
<line>Gave healthful welcome to their shipwrack&#8217;d guests,</line>
<line>And would have reft the fishers of their prey,</line>
<line>Had not their bark been very slow of sail;</line>
<line>And therefore homeward did they bend their course.</line>
<line>Thus have you heard me sever&#8217;d from my bliss,</line>
<line>That by misfortunes was my life prolong&#8217;d,</line>
<line>To tell sad stories of my own mishaps.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
<line>And for the sake of them thou sorrowest for,</line>
<line>Do me the favor to dilate at full</line>
<line>What have befall&#8217;n of them and thee till now.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>EGE.</speaker>
<line>My youngest boy, and yet my eldest care,</line>
<line>At eighteen years became inquisitive</line>
<line>After his brother; and importun&#8217;d me</line>
<line>That his attendant&#8212;so his case was like,</line>
<line>Reft of his brother, but retain&#8217;d his name&#8212;</line>
<line>Might bear him company in the quest of him:</line>
<line>Whom whilst I labored of a love to see,</line>
<line>I hazarded the loss of whom I lov&#8217;d.</line>
<line>Five summers have I spent in farthest Greece,</line>
<line>Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia,</line>
<line>And coasting homeward, came to Ephesus;</line>
<line>Hopeless to find, yet loath to leave unsought</line>
<line>Or that, or any place that harbors men.</line>
<line>But here must end the story of my life,</line>
<line>And happy were I in my timely death,</line>
<line>Could all my travels warrant me they live.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
<line>Hapless Egeon, whom the fates have mark&#8217;d</line>
<line>To bear the extremity of dire mishap!</line>
<line>Now trust me, were it not against our laws,</line>
<line>Against my crown, my oath, my dignity,</line>
<line>Which princes, would they, may not disannul,</line>
<line>My soul should sue as advocate for thee:</line>
<line>But though thou art adjudged to the death,</line>
<line>And passed sentence may not be recall&#8217;d</line>
<line>But to our honor&#8217;s great disparagement,</line>
<line>Yet will I favor thee in what I can;</line>
<line>Therefore, merchant, I&#8217;ll limit thee this day</line>
<line>To seek thy health by beneficial help.</line>
<line>Try all the friends thou hast in Ephesus;</line>
<line>Beg thou, or borrow, to make up the sum,</line>
<line>And live: if no, then thou art doom&#8217;d to die.</line>
<line>Jailer, take him to thy custody.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JAIL.</speaker>
<line>I will, my lord.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>EGE.</speaker>
<line>Hopeless and helpless doth Egeon wend,</line>
<line>But to procrastinate his liveless end.</line>

<stagedir>Enter Antipholus Erotes of Syracuse, First Merchant, and Dromio of Syracuse.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>1. MER.</speaker>
<line>Therefore give out you are of Epidamium,</line>
<line>Lest that your goods too soon be confiscate:</line>
<line>This very day a Syracusian merchant</line>
<line>Is apprehended for arrival here;</line>
<line>And not being able to buy out his life,</line>
<line>According to the statute of the town,</line>
<line>Dies ere the weary sun set in the west.</line>
<line>There is your money that I had to keep.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. ANT.</speaker>
<line>Go bear it to the Centaur, where we host,</line>
<line>And stay there, Dromio, till I come to thee.</line>
<line>Within this hour it will be dinner-time;</line>
<line>Till that, I&#8217;ll view the manners of the town,</line>
<line>Peruse the traders, gaze upon the buildings,</line>
<line>And then return and sleep within mine inn,</line>
<line>For with long travel I am stiff and weary.</line>
<line>Get thee away.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. DRO.</speaker>
<line>Many a man would take you at your word,</line>
<line>And go indeed, having so good a mean.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit Dromio.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>S. ANT.</speaker>
<line>A trusty villain, sir, that very oft,</line>
<line>When I am dull with care and melancholy,</line>
<line>Lightens my humor with his merry jests.</line>
<line>What, will you walk with me about the town,</line>
<line>And then go to my inn and dine with me?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. MER.</speaker>
<line>I am invited, sir, to certain merchants,</line>
<line>Of whom I hope to make much benefit;</line>
<line>I crave your pardon. Soon at five a&#8217; clock,</line>
<line>Please you, I&#8217;ll meet with you upon the mart,</line>
<line>And afterward consort you till bed-time:</line>
<line>My present business calls me from you now.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. ANT.</speaker>
<line>Farewell till then. I will go lose myself,</line>
<line>And wander up and down to view the city.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. MER.</speaker>
<line>Sir, I commend you to your own content.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>S. ANT.</speaker>
<line>He that commends me to mine own content,</line>
<line>Commends me to the thing I cannot get:</line>
<line>I to the world am like a drop of water,</line>
<line>That in the ocean seeks another drop,</line>
<line>Who, falling there to find his fellow forth</line>
<line>(Unseen, inquisitive), confounds himself.</line>
<line>So I, to find a mother and a brother,</line>
<line>In quest of them (unhappy), ah, lose myself.</line>

<stagedir>Enter Dromio of Ephesus.</stagedir>

<line>Here comes the almanac of my true date.</line>
<line>What now? How chance thou art return&#8217;d so soon?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>E. DRO.</speaker>
<line>Return&#8217;d so soon! Rather approach&#8217;d too late:</line>
<line>The capon burns, the pig falls from the spit;</line>
<line>The clock hath strucken twelve upon the bell:</line>
<line>My mistress made it one upon my cheek:</line>
<line>She is so hot, because the meat is cold:</line>
<line>The meat is cold, because you come not home:</line>
<line>You come not home, because you have no stomach:</line>
<line>You have no stomach, having broke your fast:</line>
<line>But we that know what &#8217;tis to fast and pray,</line>
<line>Are penitent for your default today.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. ANT.</speaker>
<line>Stop in your wind, sir; tell me this, I pray:</line>
<line>Where have you left the money that I gave you?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>E. DRO.</speaker>
<line>O&#8212;sixpence that I had a&#8217; We&#8217;n&#8217;sday last</line>
<line>To pay the saddler for my mistress&#8217; crupper?</line>
<line>The saddler had it, sir, I kept it not.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. ANT.</speaker>
<line>I am not in a sportive humor now:</line>
<line>Tell me, and dally not, where is the money?</line>
<line>We being strangers here, how dar&#8217;st thou trust</line>
<line>So great a charge from thine own custody?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>E. DRO.</speaker>
<line>I pray you jest, sir, as you sit at dinner.</line>
<line>I from my mistress come to you in post:</line>
<line>If I return, I shall be post indeed,</line>
<line>For she will score your fault upon my pate:</line>
<line>Methinks your maw, like mine, should be your clock,</line>
<line>And strike you home without a messenger.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. ANT.</speaker>
<line>Come, Dromio, come, these jests are out of season,</line>
<line>Reserve them till a merrier hour than this:</line>
<line>Where is the gold I gave in charge to thee?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>E. DRO.</speaker>
<line>To me, sir? Why, you gave no gold to me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. ANT.</speaker>
<line>Come on, sir knave, have done your foolishness,</line>
<line>And tell me how thou hast dispos&#8217;d thy charge.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>E. DRO.</speaker>
<line>My charge was but to fetch you from the mart</line>
<line>Home to your house, the Phoenix, sir, to dinner;</line>
<line>My mistress and her sister stays for you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. ANT.</speaker>
<line>Now, as I am a Christian, answer me,</line>
<line>In what safe place you have bestow&#8217;d my money;</line>
<line>Or I shall break that merry sconce of yours</line>
<line>That stands on tricks when I am undispos&#8217;d:</line>
<line>Where is the thousand marks thou hadst of me?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>E. DRO.</speaker>
<line>I have some marks of yours upon my pate;</line>
<line>Some of my mistress&#8217; marks upon my shoulders;</line>
<line>But not a thousand marks between you both.</line>
<line>If I should pay your worship those again,</line>
<line>Perchance you will not bear them patiently.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. ANT.</speaker>
<line>Thy mistress&#8217; marks? What mistress, slave, hast thou?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>E. DRO.</speaker>
<line>Your worship&#8217;s wife, my mistress at the Phoenix;</line>
<line>She that doth fast till you come home to dinner;</line>
<line>And prays that you will hie you home to dinner.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. ANT.</speaker>
<line>What, wilt thou flout me thus unto my face,</line>
<line>Being forbid? There, take you that, sir knave.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Strikes Dromio.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>E. DRO.</speaker>
<line>What mean you, sir? For God sake hold your hands!</line>
<line>Nay, and you will not, sir, I&#8217;ll take my heels.</line>

<speaker>S. ANT.</speaker>
<line>Upon my life, by some device or other</line>
<line>The villain is  o&#8217;erraught of all my money.</line>
<line>They say this town is full of cozenage:</line>
<line>As nimble jugglers that deceive the eye,</line>
<line>Dark-working sorcerers that change the mind,</line>
<line>Soul-killing witches that deform the body,</line>
<line>Disguised cheaters, prating mountebanks,</line>
<line>And many such-like liberties of sin:</line>
<line>If it prove so, I will be gone the sooner.</line>

<line>Good sister, let us dine, and never fret;</line>
<line>A man is master of his liberty:</line>

<line>Why, headstrong liberty is lash&#8217;d with woe:</line>
<line>There&#8217;s nothing situate under heaven&#8217;s eye</line>
<line>But hath his bound in earth, in sea, in sky.</line>
<line>The beasts, the fishes, and the winged fowls</line>

<line>Indu&#8217;d with intellectual sense and souls,</line>

<line>We bid be quiet when we hear it cry;</line>

<line>As much, or more, we should ourselves complain:</line>
<line>So thou, that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee,</line>

<line>His company must do his minions grace,</line>
<line>Whilst I at home starve for a merry look:</line>
<line>Hath homely age th&#8217; alluring beauty took</line>
<line>From my poor cheek? Then he hath wasted it.</line>
<line>Are my discourses dull? Barren my wit?</line>
<line>If voluble and sharp discourse be marr&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Unkindness blunts it more than marble hard.</line>
<line>Do their gay vestments his affections bait?</line>
<line>That&#8217;s not my fault, he&#8217;s master of my state.</line>
<line>What ruins are in me that can be found,</line>
<line>By him not ruin&#8217;d? Then is he the ground</line>
<line>Of my defeatures. My decayed fair</line>

<line>Would that alone a&#8217; love he would detain,</line>
<line>So he would keep fair quarter with his bed!</line>
<line>I see the jewel best enamelled</line>

<line>That others touch and, often touching, will</line>
<line>Where gold; and no man that hath a name</line>
<line>By falsehood and corruption doth it shame.</line>
<line>Since that my beauty cannot please his eye,</line>

<speech>
<speaker>S. ANT.</speaker>
<line>The gold I gave to Dromio is laid up</line>
<line>Safe at the Centaur, and the heedful slave</line>
<line>Is wand&#8217;red forth, in care to seek me out.</line>
<line>By computation and mine host&#8217;s report,</line>
<line>I could not speak with Dromio since at first</line>
<line>I sent him from the mart! See, here he comes.</line>

<stagedir>Enter Dromio of Syracuse.</stagedir>

<line>How now, sir, is your merry humor alter&#8217;d?</line>
<line>As you love strokes, so jest with me again.</line>
<line>You know no Centaur? You receiv&#8217;d no gold?</line>
<line>Your mistress sent to have me home to dinner?</line>
<line>My house was at the Phoenix? Wast thou mad,</line>
<line>That thus so madly thou didst answer me?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. DRO.</speaker>
<line>What answer, sir? When spake I such a word?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. ANT.</speaker>
<line>Even now, even here, not half an hour since.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. DRO.</speaker>
<line>I did not see you since you sent me hence</line>
<line>Home to the Centaur with the gold you gave me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. ANT.</speaker>
<line>Villain, thou didst deny the gold&#8217;s receipt,</line>
<line>And toldst me of a mistress, and a dinner,</line>
<line>For which I hope thou feltst I was displeas&#8217;d.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. DRO.</speaker>
<line>I am glad to see you in this merry vein.</line>
<line>What means this jest? I pray you, master, tell me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. ANT.</speaker>
<line>Yea, dost thou jeer and flout me in the teeth?</line>
<line>Think&#8217;st thou I jest? Hold, take thou that, and that.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Beats Dromio.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>S. DRO.</speaker>
<line>Hold, sir, for God&#8217;s sake! Now your jest is earnest,</line>
<line>Upon what bargain do you give it me?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. ANT.</speaker>
<line>Because that I familiarly sometimes</line>
<line>Do use you for my fool, and chat with you,</line>
<line>Your sauciness will jest upon my love,</line>
<line>And make a common of my serious hours.</line>
<line>When the sun shines, let foolish gnats make sport,</line>
<line>But creep in crannies, when he hides his beams:</line>
<line>If you will jest with me, know my aspect,</line>
<line>And fashion your demeanor to my looks,</line>
<line>Or I will beat this method in your sconce.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. DRO.</speaker>
<line>Sconce call you it? So you would leave battering, I had rather have it a head. And you use these blows long, I must get a sconce for my head, and insconce it too, or else I shall seek my wit in my shoulders. But I pray, sir, why am I beaten?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. ANT.</speaker>
<line>Dost thou not know?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. DRO.</speaker>
<line>Nothing, sir, but that I am beaten.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. ANT.</speaker>
<line>Shall I tell you why?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. DRO.</speaker>
<line>Ay, sir, and wherefore; for they say, every why hath a wherefore.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. ANT.</speaker>
<line>Why first&#8212;for flouting me, and then wherefore&#8212;</line>
<line>For urging it the second time to me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. DRO.</speaker>
<line>Was there ever any man thus beaten out of season,</line>
<line>When in the why and the wherefore is neither rhyme nor reason?</line>
<line>Well, sir, I thank you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. ANT.</speaker>
<line>Thank me, sir, for what?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. DRO.</speaker>
<line>Marry, sir, for this something that you gave me for nothing.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. ANT.</speaker>
<line>I&#8217;ll make you amends next, to give you nothing for something. But say, sir, is it dinner-time?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. DRO.</speaker>
<line>No, sir, I think the meat wants that I have.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. ANT.</speaker>
<line>In good time, sir: what&#8217;s that?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. DRO.</speaker>
<line>Basting.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. ANT.</speaker>
<line>Well, sir, then &#8217;twill be dry.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. DRO.</speaker>
<line>If it be, sir, I pray you eat none of it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. ANT.</speaker>
<line>Your reason?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. DRO.</speaker>
<line>Lest it make you choleric, and purchase me another dry basting.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. ANT.</speaker>
<line>Well, sir, learn to jest in good time&#8212;there&#8217;s a time for all things.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. DRO.</speaker>
<line>I durst have denied that before you were so choleric.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. ANT.</speaker>
<line>By what rule, sir?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. DRO.</speaker>
<line>Marry, sir, by a rule as plain as the plain bald pate of Father Time himself.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. ANT.</speaker>
<line>Let&#8217;s hear it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. DRO.</speaker>
<line>There&#8217;s no time for a man to recover his hair that grows bald by nature.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. ANT.</speaker>
<line>May he not do it by fine and recovery?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. DRO.</speaker>
<line>Yes, to pay a fine for a periwig, and recover the lost hair of another man.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. ANT.</speaker>
<line>Why is Time such a niggard of hair, being (as it is) so plentiful an excrement?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. DRO.</speaker>
<line>Because it is a blessing that he bestows on beasts, and what he hath scanted men in hair he hath given them in wit.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. ANT.</speaker>
<line>Why, but there&#8217;s many a man hath more hair than wit.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. DRO.</speaker>
<line>Not a man of those but he hath the wit to lose his hair.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. ANT.</speaker>
<line>Why, thou didst conclude hairy men plain dealers without wit.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. DRO.</speaker>
<line>The plainer dealer, the sooner lost; yet he loseth it in a kind of jollity.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. ANT.</speaker>
<line>For what reason?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. DRO.</speaker>
<line>For two&#8212;and sound ones too.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. ANT.</speaker>
<line>Nay, not sound, I pray you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. DRO.</speaker>
<line>Sure ones then.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. ANT.</speaker>
<line>Nay, not sure, in a thing falsing.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. DRO.</speaker>
<line>Certain ones then.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. ANT.</speaker>
<line>Name them.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. DRO.</speaker>
<line>The one, to save the money that he spends in tiring; the other, that at dinner they should not drop in his porridge.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. ANT.</speaker>
<line>You would all this time have prov&#8217;d there is no time for all things.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. DRO.</speaker>
<line>Marry, and did, sir: namely, e&#8217;en no time to recover hair lost by nature.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. ANT.</speaker>
<line>But your reason was not substantial, why there is no time to recover.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. DRO.</speaker>
<line>Thus I mend it: Time himself is bald, and therefore, to the world&#8217;s end, will have bald followers.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. ANT.</speaker>
<line>I knew &#8217;twould be a bald conclusion. But soft, who wafts us yonder?</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Adriana and Luciana.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>ADR.</speaker>
<line>Ay, ay, Antipholus, look strange and frown,</line>
<line>Some other mistress hath thy sweet aspects:</line>
<line>I am not Adriana, nor thy wife.</line>
<line>The time was once, when thou unurg&#8217;d wouldst vow</line>
<line>That never words were music to thine ear,</line>
<line>That never object pleasing in thine eye,</line>
<line>That never touch well welcome to thy hand,</line>
<line>That never meat sweet-savor&#8217;d in thy taste,</line>
<line>Unless I spake, or look&#8217;d, or touch&#8217;d, or carv&#8217;d to thee.</line>
<line>How comes it now, my husband, O, how comes it,</line>
<line>That thou art then estranged from thyself?</line>
<line>Thyself I call it, being strange to me,</line>
<line>That, undividable incorporate,</line>
<line>Am better than thy dear self&#8217;s better part.</line>
<line>Ah, do not tear away thyself from me;</line>
<line>For know, my love, as easy mayst thou fall</line>
<line>A drop of water in the breaking gulf,</line>
<line>And take unmingled thence that drop again,</line>
<line>Without addition or diminishing,</line>
<line>As take from me thyself and not me too.</line>
<line>How dearly would it touch thee to the quick,</line>
<line>Shouldst thou but hear I were licentious,</line>
<line>And that this body, consecrate to thee,</line>
<line>By ruffian lust should be contaminate?</line>
<line>Wouldst thou not spit at me, and spurn at me,</line>
<line>And hurl the name of husband in my face,</line>
<line>And tear the stain&#8217;d skin off my harlot brow,</line>
<line>And from my false hand cut the wedding-ring,</line>
<line>And break it with a deep-divorcing vow?</line>
<line>I know thou canst, and therefore see thou do it.</line>
<line>I am possess&#8217;d with an adulterate blot;</line>
<line>My blood is mingled with the crime of lust:</line>
<line>For if we two be one, and thou play false,</line>
<line>I do digest the poison of thy flesh,</line>
<line>Being strumpeted by thy contagion.</line>
<line>Keep then fair league and truce with thy true bed,</line>
<line>I live dis-stain&#8217;d, thou undishonored.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. ANT.</speaker>
<line>Plead you to me, fair dame? I know you not:</line>
<line>In Ephesus I am but two hours old,</line>
<line>As strange unto your town as to your talk,</line>
<line>Who, every word by all my wit being scann&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Wants wit in all one word to understand.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LUC.</speaker>
<line>Fie, brother, how the world is chang&#8217;d with you:</line>
<line>When were you wont to use my sister thus?</line>

<line>By thee, and this thou didst return from him,</line>
<line>That he did buffet thee, and in his blows</line>
<line>Denied my house for his, me for his wife.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. ANT.</speaker>
<line>Did you converse, sir, with this gentlewoman?</line>
<line>What is the course and drift of your compact?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. DRO.</speaker>
<line>I, sir? I never saw her till this time.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. ANT.</speaker>
<line>Villain, thou liest, for even her very words</line>
<line>Didst thou deliver to me on the mart.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. DRO.</speaker>
<line>I never spake with her in all my life.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. ANT.</speaker>
<line>How can she thus then call us by our names,</line>
<line>Unless it be by inspiration?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ADR.</speaker>
<line>How ill agrees it with your gravity</line>
<line>To counterfeit thus grossly with your slave,</line>
<line>Abetting him to thwart me in my mood!</line>
<line>Be it my wrong you are from me exempt,</line>
<line>But wrong not that wrong with a more contempt.</line>
<line>Come, I will fasten on this sleeve of thine:</line>
<line>Thou art an elm, my husband, I a vine,</line>
<line>Whose weakness, married to thy stronger state,</line>
<line>Makes me with thy strength to communicate:</line>
<line>If aught possess thee from me, it is dross,</line>
<line>Usurping ivy, brier, or idle moss,</line>
<line>Who, all for want of pruning, with intrusion</line>
<line>Infect thy sap, and live on thy confusion.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. ANT.</speaker>
<line>To me she speaks, she moves me for her theme:</line>
<line>What, was I married to her in my dream?</line>
<line>Or sleep I now and think I hear all this?</line>
<line>What error drives our eyes and ears amiss?</line>
<line>Until I know this sure uncertainty,</line>

<line>Good Signior Angelo, you must excuse us all,</line>
<line>My wife is shrewish when I keep not hours:</line>

<line>To see the making of her carcanet,</line>

<line>Well, I&#8217;ll break in: go borrow me a crow.</line>

<line>A crow without feather? Master, mean you so?</line>
<line>For a fish without a fin, there&#8217;s a fowl without a feather:</line>
<line>If a crow help us in, sirrah, we&#8217;ll pluck a crow together.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>BALTH.</speaker>
<line>Have patience, sir, O, let it not be so!</line>
<line>Herein you war against your reputation,</line>
<line>And draw within the compass of suspect</line>
<line>Th&#8217; unviolated honor of your wife.</line>
<line>Once this&#8212;your long experience of her wisdom,</line>
<line>Her sober virtue, years, and modesty,</line>
<line>Plead on her part some cause to you unknown;</line>
<line>And doubt not, sir, but she will well excuse</line>
<line>Why at this time the doors are made against you.</line>
<line>Be rul&#8217;d by me, depart in patience,</line>
<line>And let us to the Tiger all to dinner;</line>
<line>And about evening come yourself alone</line>
<line>To know the reason of this strange restraint.</line>
<line>If by strong hand you offer to break in</line>
<line>Now in the stirring passage of the day,</line>
<line>A vulgar comment will be made of it;</line>
<line>And that supposed by the common rout</line>
<line>Against your yet ungalled estimation,</line>
<line>That may with foul intrusion enter in,</line>
<line>And dwell upon your grave when you are dead;</line>
<line>For slander lives upon succession,</line>

<speech>
<speaker>E. ANT.</speaker>
<line>You have prevail&#8217;d. I will depart in quiet,</line>
<line>And in despite of mirth mean to be merry.</line>
<line>I know a wench of excellent discourse,</line>
<line>Pretty and witty; wild, and yet, too, gentle;</line>
<line>There will we dine. This woman that I mean,</line>
<line>My wife (but, I protest, without desert)</line>

<line>Bring it, I pray you, to the Porpentine,</line>
<line>For there&#8217;s the house. That chain will I bestow</line>
<line>(Be it for nothing but to spite my wife)</line>
<line>Upon mine hostess there. Good sir, make haste.</line>
<line>Since mine own doors refuse to entertain me,</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll knock elsewhere, to see if they&#8217;ll disdain me.</line>

<speech>

<line>I&#8217;ll meet you at that place some hour hence.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>LUC.</speaker>
<line>And may it be that you have quite forgot</line>
<line>A husband&#8217;s office? Shall, Antipholus,</line>
<line>Even in the spring of love, thy love-springs rot?</line>
<line>Shall love, in building, grow so ruinous?</line>
<line>If you did wed my sister for her wealth,</line>
<line>Then for her wealth&#8217;s sake use her with more kindness:</line>
<line>Or if you like elsewhere, do it by stealth,</line>
<line>Muffle your false love with some show of blindness:</line>
<line>Let not my sister read it in your eye;</line>
<line>Be not thy tongue thy own shame&#8217;s orator:</line>
<line>Look sweet, speak fair, become disloyalty;</line>
<line>Apparel vice like virtue&#8217;s harbinger;</line>
<line>Bear a fair presence, though your heart be tainted;</line>
<line>Teach sin the carriage of a holy saint;</line>
<line>Be secret-false: what need she be acquainted?</line>
<line>What simple thief brags of his own attaint?</line>
<line>&#8217;Tis double wrong, to truant with your bed,</line>
<line>And let her read it in thy looks at board:</line>
<line>Shame hath a bastard fame, well managed;</line>
<line>Ill deeds is doubled with an evil word.</line>
<line>Alas, poor women, make us but believe</line>
<line>(Being compact of credit) that you love us;</line>
<line>Though others have the arm, show us the sleeve:</line>
<line>We in your motion turn, and you may move us.</line>
<line>Then, gentle brother, get you in again;</line>
<line>Comfort my sister, cheer her, call her wife:</line>
<line>&#8217;Tis holy sport to be a little vain,</line>
<line>When the sweet breath of flattery conquers strife.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. ANT.</speaker>
<line>Sweet mistress&#8212;what your name is else, I know not,</line>
<line>Nor by what wonder you do hit of mine&#8212;</line>
<line>Less in your knowledge and your grace you show not</line>
<line>Than our earth&#8217;s wonder, more than earth divine.</line>
<line>Teach me, dear creature, how to think and speak:</line>
<line>Lay open to my earthy gross conceit,</line>
<line>Smoth&#8217;red in errors, feeble, shallow, weak,</line>
<line>The folded meaning of your words&#8217; deceit.</line>
<line>Against my soul&#8217;s pure truth why labor you,</line>
<line>To make it wander in an unknown field?</line>
<line>Are you a god? Would you create me new?</line>
<line>Transform me then, and to your pow&#8217;r I&#8217;ll yield.</line>
<line>But if that I am I, then well I know</line>
<line>Your weeping sister is no wife of mine,</line>
<line>Nor to her bed no homage do I owe:</line>
<line>Far more, far more, to you do I decline.</line>
<line>O, train me not, sweet mermaid, with thy note,</line>
<line>To drown me in thy sister&#8217;s flood of tears.</line>
<line>Sing, siren, for thyself, and I will dote;</line>
<line>Spread  o&#8217;er the silver waves thy golden hairs,</line>
<line>And as a bed I&#8217;ll take them, and there lie,</line>
<line>And in that glorious supposition think</line>
<line>He gains by death that hath such means to die:</line>
<line>Let Love, being light, be drowned if she sink!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LUC.</speaker>
<line>What, are you mad, that you do reason so?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. ANT.</speaker>
<line>Not mad, but mated&#8212;how, I do not know.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LUC.</speaker>
<line>It is a fault that springeth from your eye.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. ANT.</speaker>
<line>For gazing on your beams, fair sun, being by.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LUC.</speaker>

<speech>
<speaker>S. ANT.</speaker>
<line>As good to wink, sweet love, as look on night.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>LUC.</speaker>
<line>Why call you me love? Call my sister so.</line>

<line>Thy sister&#8217;s sister.</line>

<line offset="4">That&#8217;s my sister.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>S. ANT.</speaker>
<line offset="8">No;</line>
<line>It is thyself, mine own self&#8217;s better part:</line>
<line>Mine eye&#8217;s clear eye, my dear heart&#8217;s dearer heart,</line>
<line>My food, my fortune, and my sweet hope&#8217;s aim,</line>
<line>My sole earth&#8217;s heaven, and my heaven&#8217;s claim.</line>

<line>Call thyself sister, sweet, for I am thee:</line>

<line>Thou hast no husband yet, nor I no wife.</line>
<line>Give me thy hand.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>S. ANT.</speaker>
<line>Why, how now, Dromio, where run&#8217;st thou so fast?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. DRO.</speaker>
<line>Do you know me, sir? Am I Dromio? Am I your man? Am I myself?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. ANT.</speaker>
<line>Thou art Dromio, thou art my man, thou art thyself.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. DRO.</speaker>
<line>I am an ass, I am a woman&#8217;s man, and besides myself.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. ANT.</speaker>
<line>What woman&#8217;s man, and how besides thyself?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. DRO.</speaker>
<line>Marry, sir, besides myself, I am due to a woman: one that claims me, one that haunts me, one that will have me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. ANT.</speaker>
<line>What claim lays she to thee?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. DRO.</speaker>
<line>Marry, sir, such claim as you would lay to your horse, and she would have me as a beast; not that, I being a beast, she would have me, but that she, being a very beastly creature, lays claim to me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. ANT.</speaker>
<line>What is she?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. DRO.</speaker>
<line>A very reverent body: ay, such a one as a man may not speak of without he say &#8220;Sir-reverence.&#8221; I have but lean luck in the match, and yet is she a wondrous fat marriage.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. ANT.</speaker>
<line>How dost thou mean a fat marriage?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. DRO.</speaker>
<line>Marry, sir, she&#8217;s the kitchen wench and all grease, and I know not what use to put her to but to make a lamp of her and run from her by her own light. I warrant, her rags and the tallow in them will burn a Poland winter: if she lives till doomsday, she&#8217;ll burn a week longer than the whole world.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. ANT.</speaker>
<line>What complexion is she of?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. DRO.</speaker>
<line>Swart, like my shoe, but her face nothing like so clean kept: for why? She sweats, a man may go over shoes in the grime of it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. ANT.</speaker>
<line>That&#8217;s a fault that water will mend.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. DRO.</speaker>
<line>No, sir, &#8217;tis in grain, Noah&#8217;s flood could not do it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. ANT.</speaker>
<line>What&#8217;s her name?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. DRO.</speaker>
<line>Nell, sir; but her name and three quarters, that&#8217;s an ell and three quarters, will not measure her from hip to hip.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. ANT.</speaker>
<line>Then she bears some breadth?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. DRO.</speaker>
<line>No longer from head to foot than from hip to hip: she is spherical, like a globe; I could find out countries in her.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. ANT.</speaker>
<line>In what part of her body stands Ireland?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. DRO.</speaker>
<line>Marry, sir, in her buttocks, I found it out by the bogs.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. ANT.</speaker>
<line>Where Scotland?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. DRO.</speaker>
<line>I found it by the barrenness, hard in the palm of the hand.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. ANT.</speaker>
<line>Where France?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. DRO.</speaker>
<line>In her forehead, arm&#8217;d and reverted, making war against her heir.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. ANT.</speaker>
<line>Where England?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. DRO.</speaker>
<line>I look&#8217;d for the chalky cliffs, but I could find no whiteness in them. But I guess, it stood in her chin, by the salt rheum that ran between France and it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. ANT.</speaker>
<line>Where Spain?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. DRO.</speaker>
<line>Faith, I saw it not; but I felt it hot in her breath.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. ANT.</speaker>
<line>Where America, the Indies?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. DRO.</speaker>
<line>O, sir, upon her nose, all  o&#8217;er embellish&#8217;d with rubies, carbuncles, sapphires, declining their rich aspect to the hot breath of Spain, who sent whole armadoes of carrects to be ballast at her nose.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. ANT.</speaker>
<line>Where stood Belgia, the Netherlands?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. DRO.</speaker>
<line>O, sir, I did not look so low. To conclude, this drudge or diviner laid claim to me, call&#8217;d me Dromio, swore I was assur&#8217;d to her, told me what privy marks I had about me, as the mark of my shoulder, the mole in my neck, the great wart on my left arm, that I, amaz&#8217;d, ran from her as a witch.</line>
<line>And I think, if my breast had not been made of faith, and my heart of steel,</line>
<line>She had transform&#8217;d me to a curtal dog, and made me turn i&#8217; th&#8217; wheel.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. ANT.</speaker>
<line>Go hie thee presently, post to the road,</line>
<line>And if the wind blow any way from shore,</line>
<line>I will not harbor in this town tonight.</line>
<line>If any bark put forth, come to the mart,</line>
<line>Where I will walk till thou return to me.</line>
<line>If every one knows us, and we know none,</line>
<line>&#8217;Tis time, I think, to trudge, pack, and be gone.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. DRO.</speaker>
<line>As from a bear a man would run for life,</line>
<line>So fly I from her that would be my wife.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>S. ANT.</speaker>
<line>There&#8217;s none but witches do inhabit here,</line>
<line>And therefore &#8217;tis high time that I were hence.</line>
<line>She that doth call me husband, even my soul</line>
<line>Doth for a wife abhor. But her fair sister,</line>
<line>Possess&#8217;d with such a gentle sovereign grace,</line>
<line>Of such enchanting presence and discourse,</line>
<line>Hath almost made me traitor to myself;</line>
<line>But lest myself be guilty to self-wrong,</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll stop mine ears against the mermaid&#8217;s song.</line>

<line>Made it for me, sir! I bespoke it not.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANG.</speaker>
<line>Not once, nor twice, but twenty times you have.</line>
<line>Go home with it, and please your wife withal,</line>

<line>I see a man here needs not live by shifts,</line>

<line>Among my wife and her confederates,</line>

<line>A man is well holp up that trusts to you:</line>
<line>I promised your presence and the chain,</line>
<line>But neither chain nor goldsmith came to me:</line>
<line>Belike you thought our love would last too long</line>
<line>If it were chain&#8217;d together, and therefore came not.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANG.</speaker>
<line>Saving your merry humor, here&#8217;s the note</line>
<line>How much your chain weighs to the utmost charect,</line>
<line>The fineness of the gold, and chargeful fashion,</line>
<line>Which doth amount to three odd ducats more</line>
<line>Than I stand debted to this gentleman.</line>
<line>I pray you see him presently discharg&#8217;d,</line>
<line>For he is bound to sea, and stays but for it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>E. ANT.</speaker>
<line>I am not furnish&#8217;d with the present money:</line>
<line>Besides, I have some business in the town.</line>
<line>Good signior, take the stranger to my house,</line>
<line>And with you take the chain, and bid my wife</line>
<line>Disburse the sum on the receipt thereof.</line>
<line>Perchance I will be there as soon as you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>

<line>No, bear it with you, lest I come not time enough.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>ANG.</speaker>
<line>Well, sir, I will. Have you the chain about you?</line>

<line>And if I have not, sir, I hope you have:</line>
<line>Or else you may return without your money.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANG.</speaker>
<line>Nay, come, I pray you, sir, give me the chain:</line>
<line>Both wind and tide stays for this gentleman,</line>
<line>And I, to blame, have held him here too long.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>E. ANT.</speaker>
<line>Good Lord! You use this dalliance to excuse</line>
<line>Your breach of promise to the Porpentine:</line>

<line>Come, where&#8217;s the chain? I pray you let me see it.</line>

<line>My business cannot brook this dalliance.</line>
<line>Good sir, say whe&#8217;r You&#8217;ll answer me or no:</line>

<speech>
<speaker>E. ANT.</speaker>
<line>You gave me none, you wrong me much to say so.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANG.</speaker>
<line>You wrong me more, sir, in denying it.</line>
<line>Consider how it stands upon my credit.</line>

<line>Either consent to pay this sum for me</line>

<line>Consent to pay thee that I never had!</line>
<line>Arrest me, foolish fellow, if thou dar&#8217;st.</line>

<line>Here is thy fee, arrest him, officer.</line>
<line>I would not spare my brother in this case,</line>

<line>I do arrest you, sir: you hear the suit.</line>

<line>Thou art sensible in nothing but blows, and so is an ass.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>E. DRO.</speaker>
<line>I am an ass indeed; you may prove it by my long ears. I have serv&#8217;d him from the hour of my nativity to this instant, and have nothing at his hands for my service but blows. When I am cold, he heats me with beating; when I am warm, he cools me with beating. I am wak&#8217;d with it when I sleep, rais&#8217;d with it when I sit, driven out of doors with it when I go from home, welcom&#8217;d home with it when I return; nay, I bear it on my shoulders, as a beggar wont her brat; and I think when he hath lam&#8217;d me, I shall beg with it from door to door.</line>

<line>You minion, you, are these your customers?</line>
<line>Did this companion with the saffron face</line>

<line>Good sir, draw near to me, I&#8217;ll speak to him.</line>
<line>Signior Antipholus, I wonder much</line>
<line>That you would put me to this shame and trouble,</line>

<line>With circumstance and oaths so to deny</line>
<line>This chain which now you wear so openly.</line>
<line>Beside the charge, the shame, imprisonment,</line>

<line>At board he fed not for my urging it;</line>
<line>Alone, it was the subject of my theme;</line>
<line>In company I often glanced it;</line>
<line>Still did I tell him it was vild and bad.</line>
</speech>

<line>Thou say&#8217;st his sports were hind&#8217;red by thy brawls:</line>
<line>Sweet recreation barr&#8217;d, what doth ensue</line>
<line>But moody and dull melancholy,</line>
<line>Kinsman to grim and comfortless despair,</line>
<line>And at her heels a huge infectious troop</line>
<line>Of pale distemperatures and foes to life?</line>
<line>In food, in sport, and life-preserving rest</line>
<line>To be disturb&#8217;d, would mad or man or beast:</line>

<line>To make of him a formal man again:</line>
<line>It is a branch and parcel of mine oath,</line>
<line>A charitable duty of my order,</line>
<line>Therefore depart, and leave him here with me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ADR.</speaker>
<line>I will not hence, and leave my husband here;</line>
<line>And ill it doth beseem your holiness</line>

<line>If any friend will pay the sum for him,</line>
<line>He shall not die, so much we tender him.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>ADR.</speaker>
<line>Justice, most sacred Duke, against the abbess!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
<line>She is a virtuous and a reverend lady,</line>
<line>It cannot be that she hath done thee wrong.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ADR.</speaker>
<line>May it please your Grace, Antipholus my husband,</line>
<line>Who I made lord of me and all I had,</line>
<line>At your important letters&#8212;this ill day</line>
<line>A most outrageous fit of madness took him,</line>
<line>That desp&#8217;rately he hurried through the street&#8212;</line>
<line>With him his bondman, all as mad as he&#8212;</line>
<line>Doing displeasure to the citizens</line>
<line>By rushing in their houses, bearing thence</line>
<line>Rings, jewels, any thing his rage did like.</line>
<line>Once did I get him bound, and sent him home,</line>
<line>Whilst to take order for the wrongs I went,</line>
<line>That here and there his fury had committed.</line>
<line>Anon, I wot not by what strong escape,</line>
<line>He broke from those that had the guard of him,</line>
<line>And with his mad attendant and himself,</line>
<line>Each one with ireful passion, with drawn swords,</line>
<line>Met us again, and madly bent on us</line>
<line>Chas&#8217;d us away; till raising of more aid,</line>
<line>We came again to bind them. Then they fled</line>
<line>Into this abbey, whither we pursu&#8217;d them,</line>
<line>And here the abbess shuts the gates on us,</line>
<line>And will not suffer us to fetch him out,</line>
<line>Nor send him forth, that we may bear him hence.</line>
<line>Therefore, most gracious Duke, with thy command</line>
<line>Let him be brought forth, and borne hence for help.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
<line>Long since thy husband serv&#8217;d me in my wars,</line>
<line>And I to thee engag&#8217;d a prince&#8217;s word,</line>
<line>When thou didst make him master of thy bed,</line>
<line>To do him all the grace and good I could.</line>
<line>Go some of you, knock at the abbey-gate,</line>
<line>And bid the Lady Abbess come to me:</line>
<line>I will determine this before I stir.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter a Messenger.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>MESS.</speaker>
<line>O mistress, mistress, shift and save yourself!</line>
<line>My master and his man are both broke loose,</line>
<line>Beaten the maids a-row, and bound the doctor,</line>
<line>Whose beard they have sing&#8217;d off with brands of fire,</line>
<line>And ever as it blaz&#8217;d, they threw on him</line>
<line>Great pails of puddled mire to quench the hair;</line>
<line>My master preaches patience to him, and the while</line>
<line>His man with scissors nicks him like a fool;</line>
<line>And sure (unless you send some present help)</line>
<line>Between them they will kill the conjurer.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ADR.</speaker>
<line>Peace, fool, thy master and his man are here,</line>
<line>And that is false thou dost report to us.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MESS.</speaker>
<line>Mistress, upon my life, I tell you true;</line>
<line>I have not breath&#8217;d almost since I did see it.</line>
<line>He cries for you, and vows, if he can take you,</line>
<line>To scorch your face, and to disfigure you.</line>

<stagedir>Cry within.</stagedir>

<line>Hark, hark, I hear him, mistress; fly, be gone!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
<line>Come stand by me, fear nothing. Guard with halberds!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ADR.</speaker>
<line>Ay me, it is my husband! Witness you,</line>
<line>That he is borne about invisible:</line>
<line>Even now we hous&#8217;d him in the abbey here,</line>
<line>And now he&#8217;s there, past thought of human reason.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Antipholus of Ephesus and Dromio of Ephesus.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>E. ANT.</speaker>
<line>Justice, most gracious Duke, O, grant me justice,</line>
<line>Even for the service that long since I did thee,</line>
<line>When I bestrid thee in the wars, and took</line>
<line>Deep scars to save thy life; even for the blood</line>
<line>That then I lost for thee, now grant me justice.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>EGE.</speaker>
<line>Unless the fear of death doth make me dote,</line>
<line>I see my son Antipholus and Dromio.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>E. ANT.</speaker>
<line>Justice, sweet prince, against that woman there!</line>
<line>She whom thou gav&#8217;st to me to be my wife;</line>
<line>That hath abused and dishonored me,</line>
<line>Even in the strength and height of injury:</line>
<line>Beyond imagination is the wrong</line>
<line>That she this day hath shameless thrown on me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
<line>Discover how, and thou shalt find me just.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>E. ANT.</speaker>
<line>This day, great Duke, she shut the doors upon me,</line>
<line>While she with harlots feasted in my house.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
<line>A grievous fault! Say, woman, didst thou so?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ADR.</speaker>
<line>No, my good lord. Myself, he, and my sister</line>
<line>Today did dine together: so befall my soul</line>
<line>As this is false he burdens me withal!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LUC.</speaker>
<line>Ne&#8217;er may I look on day, nor sleep on night,</line>
<line>But she tells to your Highness simple truth!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANG.</speaker>
<line>O perjur&#8217;d woman! They are both forsworn:</line>
<line>In this the madman justly chargeth them.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>E. ANT.</speaker>
<line>My liege, I am advised what I say,</line>
<line>Neither disturbed with the effect of wine,</line>
<line>Nor heady-rash, provok&#8217;d with raging ire,</line>
<line>Albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad.</line>
<line>This woman lock&#8217;d me out this day from dinner;</line>
<line>That goldsmith there, were he not pack&#8217;d with her,</line>
<line>Could witness it, for he was with me then,</line>
<line>Who parted with me to go fetch a chain,</line>
<line>Promising to bring it to the Porpentine,</line>
<line>Where Balthazar and I did dine together.</line>
<line>Our dinner done, and he not coming thither,</line>
<line>I went to seek him. In the street I met him,</line>
<line>And in his company that gentleman.</line>
<line>There did this perjur&#8217;d goldsmith swear me down</line>
<line>That I this day of him receiv&#8217;d the chain,</line>
<line>Which, God he knows, I saw not; for the which</line>
<line>He did arrest me with an officer.</line>
<line>I did obey, and sent my peasant home</line>
<line>For certain ducats; he with none return&#8217;d.</line>
<line>Then fairly I bespoke the officer</line>
<line>To go in person with me to my house.</line>
<line>By th&#8217; way we met</line>
<line>My wife, her sister, and a rabble more</line>
<line>Of vild confederates. Along with them</line>
<line>They brought one Pinch, a hungry lean-fac&#8217;d villain,</line>
<line>A mere anatomy, a mountebank,</line>
<line>A threadbare juggler and a fortune-teller,</line>
<line>A needy, hollow-ey&#8217;d, sharp-looking wretch,</line>
<line>A living dead man. This pernicious slave,</line>
<line>Forsooth, took on him as a conjurer,</line>
<line>And gazing in mine eyes, feeling my pulse,</line>
<line>And with no face, as &#8217;twere, outfacing me,</line>
<line>Cries out, I was possess&#8217;d. Then all together</line>
<line>They fell upon me, bound me, bore me thence,</line>
<line>And in a dark and dankish vault at home</line>
<line>There left me and my man, both bound together,</line>
<line>Till gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder,</line>
<line>I gain&#8217;d my freedom; and immediately</line>
<line>Ran hither to your Grace, whom I beseech</line>
<line>To give me ample satisfaction</line>
<line>For these deep shames and great indignities.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANG.</speaker>
<line>My lord, in truth, thus far I witness with him:</line>
<line>That he din&#8217;d not at home, but was lock&#8217;d out.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
<line>But had he such a chain of thee, or no?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANG.</speaker>
<line>He had, my lord, and when he ran in here,</line>
<line>These people saw the chain about his neck.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. MER.</speaker>
<line>Besides, I will be sworn these ears of mine</line>
<line>Heard you confess you had the chain of him,</line>
<line>After you first forswore it on the mart,</line>
<line>And thereupon I drew my sword on you;</line>
<line>And then you fled into this abbey here,</line>
<line>From whence I think you are come by miracle.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>E. ANT.</speaker>
<line>I never came within these abbey walls,</line>
<line>Nor ever didst thou draw thy sword on me;</line>
<line>I never saw the chain, so help me heaven;</line>
<line>And this is false you burden me withal.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
<line>Why, what an intricate impeach is this!</line>
<line>I think you all have drunk of Circe&#8217;s cup.</line>
<line>If here you hous&#8217;d him, here he would have been;</line>
<line>If he were mad, he would not plead so coldly.</line>
<line>You say he din&#8217;d at home; the goldsmith here</line>
<line>Denies that saying. Sirrah, what say you?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>E. DRO.</speaker>
<line>Sir, he din&#8217;d with her there, at the Porpentine.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>COUR.</speaker>
<line>He did, and from my finger snatch&#8217;d that ring.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>E. ANT.</speaker>
<line>&#8217;Tis true, my liege, this ring I had of her.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
<line>Saw&#8217;st thou him enter at the abbey here?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>COUR.</speaker>
<line>As sure, my liege, as I do see your Grace.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
<line>Why, this is strange. Go call the abbess hither.</line>
<line>I think you are all mated, or stark mad.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit one to the abbess.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>EGE.</speaker>
<line>Most mighty Duke, vouchsafe me speak a word:</line>
<line>Haply I see a friend will save my life,</line>
<line>And pay the sum that may deliver me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
<line>Speak freely, Syracusian, what thou wilt.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>EGE.</speaker>
<line>Is not your name, sir, call&#8217;d Antipholus?</line>
<line>And is not that your bondman, Dromio?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>E. DRO.</speaker>
<line>Within this hour I was his bondman, sir,</line>
<line>But he, I thank him, gnaw&#8217;d in two my cords:</line>
<line>Now am I Dromio, and his man, unbound.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>EGE.</speaker>
<line>I am sure you both of you remember me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>E. DRO.</speaker>
<line>Ourselves we do remember, sir, by you;</line>
<line>For lately we were bound as you are now.</line>
<line>You are not Pinch&#8217;s patient, are you, sir?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>EGE.</speaker>
<line>Why look you strange on me? You know me well.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>E. ANT.</speaker>
<line>I never saw you in my life till now.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>EGE.</speaker>
<line>O! Grief hath chang&#8217;d me since you saw me last,</line>
<line>And careful hours with time&#8217;s deformed hand</line>
<line>Have written strange defeatures in my face:</line>
<line>But tell me yet, dost thou not know my voice?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>E. ANT.</speaker>
<line>Neither.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>EGE.</speaker>
<line>Dromio, nor thou?</line>

<speech>
<speaker>EGE.</speaker>
<line>I am sure thou dost!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>E. DRO.</speaker>
<line>Ay, sir, but I am sure I do not&#8212;and whatsoever a man denies, you are now bound to believe him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>EGE.</speaker>
<line>Not know my voice! O time&#8217;s extremity,</line>
<line>Hast thou so crack&#8217;d and splitted my poor tongue</line>
<line>In seven short years, that here my only son</line>
<line>Knows not my feeble key of untun&#8217;d cares?</line>
<line>Though now this grained face of mine be hid</line>
<line>In sap-consuming winter&#8217;s drizzled snow,</line>
<line>And all the conduits of my blood froze up,</line>
<line>Yet hath my night of life some memory,</line>
<line>My wasting lamps some fading glimmer left,</line>
<line>My dull deaf ears a little use to hear:</line>
<line>All these old witnesses&#8212;I cannot err&#8212;</line>
<line>Tell me thou art my son Antipholus.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>E. ANT.</speaker>
<line>I never saw my father in my life.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>EGE.</speaker>
<line>But seven years since, in Syracuse, boy,</line>
<line>Thou know&#8217;st we parted, but perhaps, my son,</line>
<line>Thou sham&#8217;st to acknowledge me in misery.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>E. ANT.</speaker>
<line>The Duke, and all that know me in the city,</line>
<line>Can witness with me that it is not so.</line>
<line>I ne&#8217;er saw Syracuse in my life.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
<line>I tell thee, Syracusian, twenty years</line>
<line>Have I been patron to Antipholus,</line>
<line>During which time he ne&#8217;er saw Syracuse:</line>
<line>I see thy age and dangers make thee dote.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter the abbess with Antipholus of Syracuse and Dromio of Syracuse.</stagedir>

<line>I see two husbands, or mine eyes deceive me.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
<line>One of these men is genius to the other:</line>
<line>And so of these, which is the natural man,</line>
<line>And which the spirit? Who deciphers them?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>S. DRO.</speaker>
<line>I, sir, am Dromio, command him away.</line>

<line>Egeon art thou not? Or else his ghost?</line>

<speech>
<speaker>S. DRO.</speaker>
<line>O my old master, who hath bound him here?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ABB.</speaker>
<line>Whoever bound him, I will loose his bonds,</line>
<line>And gain a husband by his liberty.</line>
<line>Speak, old Egeon, if thou be&#8217;st the man</line>
<line>That hadst a wife once call&#8217;d Aemilia,</line>
<line>That bore thee at a burden two fair sons.</line>
<line>O, if thou be&#8217;st the same Egeon, speak,</line>
<line>And speak unto the same Aemilia!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>EGE.</speaker>
<line>If I dream not, thou art Aemilia.</line>
<line>If thou art she, tell me, where is that son</line>
<line>That floated with thee on the fatal raft?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ABB.</speaker>
<line>By men of Epidamium he and I,</line>
<line>And the twin Dromio, all were taken up;</line>
<line>But by and by rude fishermen of Corinth</line>
<line>By force took Dromio and my son from them,</line>
<line>And me they left with those of Epidamium.</line>
<line>What then became of them I cannot tell;</line>
<line>I to this fortune that you see me in.</line>

<speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
<line>Why, here begins his morning story right:</line>
<line>These two Antipholus&#8217;, these two so like,</line>
<line>And these two Dromios, one in semblance&#8212;</line>
<line>Besides her urging of her wrack at sea&#8212;</line>
<line>These are the parents to these children,</line>
<line>Which accidentally are met together.</line>
<line>Antipholus, thou cam&#8217;st from Corinth first?</line>

<line>No, sir, not I, I came from Syracuse.</line>
