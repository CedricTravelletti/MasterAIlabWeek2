<SCENEPERSONAE>(Roderigo, Iago, Brabantio, Servants)</SCENEPERSONAE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter Roderigo and Iago.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tush, never tell me! I take it much unkindly</LINE>
<LINE>That thou, Iago, who hast had my purse</LINE>
<LINE>As if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;Sblood, but you&#8217;ll not hear me.</LINE>
<LINE>If ever I did dream of such a matter,</LINE>
<LINE>Abhor me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou toldst me thou didst hold him in thy hate.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Despise me if I do not. Three great ones of the city,</LINE>
<LINE>In personal suit to make me his lieutenant,</LINE>
<LINE>Off-capp&#8217;d to him; and, by the faith of man,</LINE>
<LINE>I know my price, I am worth no worse a place.</LINE>
<LINE>But he (as loving his own pride and purposes)</LINE>
<LINE>Evades them with a bumbast circumstance</LINE>
<LINE>Horribly stuff&#8217;d with epithites of war,</LINE>
<LINE>And in conclusion,</LINE>
<LINE>Nonsuits my mediators; for, &#8220;Certes,&#8221; says he,</LINE>
<LINE>&#8220;I have already chose my officer.&#8221;</LINE>
<LINE>And what was he?</LINE>
<LINE>Forsooth, a great arithmetician,</LINE>
<LINE>One Michael Cassio, a Florentine</LINE>
<LINE>(A fellow almost damn&#8217;d in a fair wife),</LINE>
<LINE>That never set a squadron in the field,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor the division of a battle knows</LINE>
<LINE>More than a spinster&#8212;unless the bookish theoric,</LINE>
<LINE>Wherein the toged consuls can propose</LINE>
<LINE>As masterly as he. Mere prattle, without practice,</LINE>
<LINE>Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had th&#8217; election;</LINE>
<LINE>And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof</LINE>
<LINE>At Rhodes, at Cyprus, and on other grounds</LINE>
<LINE>Christen&#8217;d and heathen, must be belee&#8217;d and calm&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>By debitor and creditor&#8212;this counter&#8212;caster,</LINE>
<LINE>He (in good time!) must his lieutenant be,</LINE>
<LINE>And I (God bless the mark!) his Moorship&#8217;s ancient.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By heaven, I rather would have been his hangman.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, there&#8217;s no remedy. &#8217;Tis the curse of service;</LINE>
<LINE>Preferment goes by letter and affection,</LINE>
<LINE>And not by old gradation, where each second</LINE>
<LINE>Stood heir to th&#8217; first. Now, sir, be judge yourself</LINE>
<LINE>Whether I in any just term am affin&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>To love the Moor.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">I would not follow him then.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, sir, content you;</LINE>
<LINE>I follow him to serve my turn upon him.</LINE>
<LINE>We cannot all be masters, nor all masters</LINE>
<LINE>Cannot be truly follow&#8217;d. You shall mark</LINE>
<LINE>Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave</LINE>
<LINE>That (doting on his own obsequious bondage)</LINE>
<LINE>Wears out his time, much like his master&#8217;s ass,</LINE>
<LINE>For nought but provender, and when he&#8217;s old, cashier&#8217;d.</LINE>
<LINE>Whip me such honest knaves. Others there are</LINE>
<LINE>Who, trimm&#8217;d in forms and visages of duty,</LINE>
<LINE>Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves,</LINE>
<LINE>And throwing but shows of service on their lords,</LINE>
<LINE>Do well thrive by them; and when they have lin&#8217;d their coats,</LINE>
<LINE>Do themselves homage. These fellows have some soul,</LINE>
<LINE>And such a one do I profess myself. For, sir,</LINE>
<LINE>It is as sure as you are Roderigo,</LINE>
<LINE>Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago.</LINE>
<LINE>In following him, I follow but myself;</LINE>
<LINE>Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,</LINE>
<LINE>But seeming so, for my peculiar end;</LINE>
<LINE>For when my outward action doth demonstrate</LINE>
<LINE>The native act and figure of my heart</LINE>
<LINE>In complement extern, &#8217;tis not long after</LINE>
<LINE>But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve</LINE>
<LINE>For daws to peck at: I am not what I am.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What a full fortune does the thick-lips owe</LINE>
<LINE>If he can carry&#8217;t thus!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Call up her father.</LINE>
<LINE>Rouse him, make after him, poison his delight,</LINE>
<LINE>Proclaim him in the streets; incense her kinsmen,</LINE>
<LINE>And though he in a fertile climate dwell,</LINE>
<LINE>Plague him with flies. Though that his joy be joy,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet throw such changes of vexation on&#8217;t,</LINE>
<LINE>As it may lose some color.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here is her father&#8217;s house, I&#8217;ll call aloud.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do, with like timorous accent and dire yell</LINE>
<LINE>As when, by night and negligence, the fire</LINE>
<LINE>Is spied in populous cities.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What ho! Brabantio, Signior Brabantio, ho!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Awake! What ho, Brabantio! Thieves, thieves!</LINE>
<LINE>Look to your house, your daughter, and your bags!</LINE>
<LINE>Thieves, thieves!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Brabantio above at a window.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRA.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What is the reason of this terrible summons?</LINE>
<LINE>What is the matter there?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Signior, is all your family within?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Are your doors lock&#8217;d?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRA.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Why? Wherefore ask you this?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;Zounds, sir, y&#8217; are robb&#8217;d! For shame, put on your gown;</LINE>
<LINE>Your heart is burst, you have lost half your soul;</LINE>
<LINE>Even now, now, very now, an old black ram</LINE>
<LINE>Is tupping your white ewe. Arise, arise!</LINE>
<LINE>Awake the snorting citizens with the bell,</LINE>
<LINE>Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you.</LINE>
<LINE>Arise, I say!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRA.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="3">What, have you lost your wits?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Most reverend signior, do you know my voice?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRA.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not I; what are you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My name is Roderigo.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRA.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">The worser welcome;</LINE>
<LINE>I have charg&#8217;d thee not to haunt about my doors.</LINE>
<LINE>In honest plainness thou hast heard me say</LINE>
<LINE>My daughter is not for thee; and now, in madness</LINE>
<LINE>(Being full of supper and distemp&#8217;ring draughts),</LINE>
<LINE>Upon malicious bravery dost thou come</LINE>
<LINE>To start my quiet.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, sir, sir&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRA.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="3">But thou must needs be sure</LINE>
<LINE>My spirits and my place have in their power</LINE>
<LINE>To make this bitter to thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Patience, good sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRA.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What tell&#8217;st thou me of robbing? This is Venice;</LINE>
<LINE>My house is not a grange.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Most grave Brabantio,</LINE>
<LINE>In simple and pure soul I come to you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;Zounds, sir, you are one of those that will not serve God, if the devil bid you. Because we come to do you service, and you think we are ruffians, You&#8217;ll have your daughter cover&#8217;d with a Barbary horse, You&#8217;ll have your nephews neigh to you; You&#8217;ll have coursers for cousins, and gennets for germans.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRA.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What profane wretch art thou?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am one, sir, that comes to tell you your daughter and the Moor are now making the beast with two backs.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRA.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou art a villain.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">You are a senator.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRA.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This thou shalt answer; I know thee, Roderigo.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, I will answer any thing. But I beseech you,</LINE>
<LINE>If&#8217;t be your pleasure and most wise consent</LINE>
<LINE>(As partly I find it is) that your fair daughter,</LINE>
<LINE>At this odd-even and dull watch o&#8217; th&#8217; night,</LINE>
<LINE>Transported with no worse nor better guard</LINE>
<LINE>But with a knave of common hire, a gundolier,</LINE>
<LINE>To the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>If this be known to you, and your allowance,</LINE>
<LINE>We then have done you bold and saucy wrongs;</LINE>
<LINE>But if you know not this, my manners tell me</LINE>
<LINE>We have your wrong rebuke. Do not believe</LINE>
<LINE>That, from the sense of all civility,</LINE>
<LINE>I thus would play and trifle with your reverence.</LINE>
<LINE>Your daughter (if you have not given her leave),</LINE>
<LINE>I say again, hath made a gross revolt,</LINE>
<LINE>Tying her duty, beauty, wit, and fortunes</LINE>
<LINE>In an extravagant and wheeling stranger</LINE>
<LINE>Of here and every where. Straight satisfy yourself.</LINE>
<LINE>If she be in her chamber or your house,</LINE>
<LINE>Let loose on me the justice of the state</LINE>
<LINE>For thus deluding you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRA.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Strike on the tinder, ho!</LINE>
<LINE>Give me a taper! Call up all my people!</LINE>
<LINE>This accident is not unlike my dream,</LINE>
<LINE>Belief of it oppresses me already.</LINE>
<LINE>Light, I say, light!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit above.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Farewell; for I must leave you.</LINE>
<LINE>It seems not meet, nor wholesome to my place,</LINE>
<LINE>To be producted (as, if I stay, I shall)</LINE>
<LINE>Against the Moor; for I do know the state</LINE>
<LINE>(How ever this may gall him with some check)</LINE>
<LINE>Cannot with safety cast him, for he&#8217;s embark&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>With such loud reason to the Cyprus wars</LINE>
<LINE>(Which even now stands in act) that, for their souls,</LINE>
<LINE>Another of his fathom they have none</LINE>
<LINE>To lead their business; in which regard,</LINE>
<LINE>Though I do hate him as I do hell-pains,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet, for necessity of present life,</LINE>
<LINE>I must show out a flag and sign of love,</LINE>
<LINE>Which is indeed but sign. That you shall surely find him,</LINE>
<LINE>Lead to the Sagittary the raised search;</LINE>
<LINE>And there will I be with him. So farewell.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit.</STAGEDIR>

<STAGEDIR>Enter below Brabantio in his night-gown with Servants and torches.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRA.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is too true an evil; gone she is;</LINE>
<LINE>And what&#8217;s to come of my despised time</LINE>
<LINE>Is nought but bitterness. Now, Roderigo,</LINE>
<LINE>Where didst thou see her?&#8212;O unhappy girl!&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>With the Moor, say&#8217;st thou?&#8212;Who would be a father!&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>How didst thou know &#8217;twas she?&#8212;O, she deceives me</LINE>
<LINE>Past thought!&#8212;What said she to you?&#8212;Get more tapers;</LINE>
<LINE>Raise all my kindred.&#8212;Are they married, think you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Truly, I think they are.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRA.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O heaven! How got she out? O treason of the blood!</LINE>
<LINE>Fathers, from hence trust not your daughters&#8217; minds</LINE>
<LINE>By what you see them act. Is there not charms</LINE>
<LINE>By which the property of youth and maidhood</LINE>
<LINE>May be abus&#8217;d? Have you not read, Roderigo,</LINE>
<LINE>Of some such thing?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Yes, sir, I have indeed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRA.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Call up my brother.&#8212;O would you had had her!&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Some one way, some another.&#8212;Do you know</LINE>
<LINE>Where we may apprehend her and the Moor?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I think I can discover him, if you please</LINE>
<LINE>To get good guard and go along with me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRA.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pray you lead on. At every house I&#8217;ll call</LINE>
<LINE>(I may command at most).&#8212;Get weapons, ho!</LINE>
<LINE>And raise some special officers of night.&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>On, good Roderigo, I will deserve your pains.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Othello, Iago, Attendants with torches.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Though in the trade of war I have slain men,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet do I hold it very stuff o&#8217; th&#8217; conscience</LINE>
<LINE>To do no contriv&#8217;d murder. I lack iniquity</LINE>
<LINE>Sometime to do me service. Nine or ten times</LINE>
<LINE>I had thought t&#8217; have yerk&#8217;d him here under the ribs.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis better as it is.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Nay, but he prated,</LINE>
<LINE>And spoke such scurvy and provoking terms</LINE>
<LINE>Against your honor,</LINE>
<LINE>That with the little godliness I have</LINE>
<LINE>I did full hard forbear him. But I pray you, sir,</LINE>
<LINE>Are you fast married? Be assur&#8217;d of this,</LINE>
<LINE>That the magnifico is much belov&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>And hath in his effect a voice potential</LINE>
<LINE>As double as the Duke&#8217;s. He will divorce you,</LINE>
<LINE>Or put upon you what restraint or grievance</LINE>
<LINE>The law (with all his might to enforce it on)</LINE>
<LINE>Will give him cable.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Let him do his spite;</LINE>
<LINE>My services which I have done the signiory</LINE>
<LINE>Shall out&#8212;tongue his complaints. &#8217;Tis yet to know&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Which, when I know that boasting is an honor,</LINE>
<LINE>I shall provulgate&#8212;I fetch my life and being</LINE>
<LINE>From men of royal siege, and my demerits</LINE>
<LINE>May speak, unbonneted, to as proud a fortune</LINE>
<LINE>As this that I have reach&#8217;d; for know, Iago,</LINE>
<LINE>But that I love the gentle Desdemona,</LINE>
<LINE>I would not my unhoused free condition</LINE>
<LINE>Put into circumscription and confine</LINE>
<LINE>For the sea&#8217;s worth. But look, what lights come yond?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Cassio with Officers and torches.</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>Those are the raised father and his friends.</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>My parts, my title, and my perfect soul</LINE>

<SPEAKER>CAS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">The Duke does greet you, general,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">What is the matter, think you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Something from Cyprus, as I may divine;</LINE>
<LINE>It is a business of some heat. The galleys</LINE>
<LINE>Have sent a dozen sequent messengers</LINE>
<LINE>This very night at one another&#8217;s heels;</LINE>
<LINE>And many of the consuls, rais&#8217;d and met,</LINE>
<LINE>Are at the Duke&#8217;s already. You have been hotly call&#8217;d for;</LINE>
<LINE>When, being not at your lodging to be found,</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<LINE>You, Roderigo! Come, sir, I am for you.</LINE>

<LINE>Keep up your bright swords, for the dew will rust them.</LINE>
<LINE>Good signior, you shall more command with years</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRA.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O thou foul thief, where hast thou stow&#8217;d my daughter?</LINE>
<LINE>Damn&#8217;d as thou art, thou hast enchanted her,</LINE>
<LINE>For I&#8217;ll refer me to all things of sense,</LINE>
<LINE>If she in chains of magic were not bound,</LINE>
<LINE>Whether a maid so tender, fair, and happy,</LINE>
<LINE>So opposite to marriage that she shunn&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>The wealthy curled darlings of our nation,</LINE>
<LINE>Would ever have, t&#8217; incur a general mock,</LINE>
<LINE>Run from her guardage to the sooty bosom</LINE>
<LINE>Of such a thing as thou&#8212;to fear, not to delight!</LINE>
<LINE>Judge me the world, if &#8217;tis not gross in sense,</LINE>
<LINE>That thou hast practic&#8217;d on her with foul charms,</LINE>
<LINE>Abus&#8217;d her delicate youth with drugs or minerals</LINE>
<LINE>That weakens motion. I&#8217;ll have&#8217;t disputed on,</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis probable, and palpable to thinking.</LINE>

<LINE>And let ourselves again but understand</LINE>
<LINE>That, as it more concerns the Turk than Rhodes,</LINE>
<LINE>So may he with more facile question bear it,</LINE>
<LINE>For that it stands not in such warlike brace,</LINE>
<LINE>But altogether lacks th&#8217; abilities</LINE>
<LINE>That Rhodes is dress&#8217;d in&#8212;if we make thought of this,</LINE>
<LINE>We must not think the Turk is so unskillful</LINE>

<LINE>Nothing, but this is so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Most potent, grave, and reverend signiors,</LINE>
<LINE>My very noble and approv&#8217;d good masters:</LINE>
<LINE>That I have ta&#8217;en away this old man&#8217;s daughter,</LINE>
<LINE>It is most true; true I have married her;</LINE>
<LINE>The very head and front of my offending</LINE>
<LINE>Hath this extent, no more. Rude am I in my speech,</LINE>
<LINE>And little bless&#8217;d with the soft phrase of peace;</LINE>
<LINE>For since these arms of mine had seven years&#8217; pith,</LINE>
<LINE>Till now some nine moons wasted, they have us&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>Their dearest action in the tented field;</LINE>
<LINE>And little of this great world can I speak</LINE>
<LINE>More than pertains to feats of broils and battle,</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore little shall I grace my cause</LINE>
<LINE>In speaking for myself. Yet (by your gracious patience)</LINE>
<LINE>I will a round unvarnish&#8217;d tale deliver</LINE>
<LINE>Of my whole course of love&#8212;what drugs, what charms,</LINE>
<LINE>What conjuration, and what mighty magic</LINE>
<LINE>(For such proceeding I am charg&#8217;d withal)</LINE>
<LINE>I won his daughter.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRA.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">A maiden, never bold;</LINE>
<LINE>Of spirit so still and quiet that her motion</LINE>
<LINE>Blush&#8217;d at herself; and she, in spite of nature,</LINE>
<LINE>Of years, of country, credit, every thing,</LINE>
<LINE>To fall in love with what she fear&#8217;d to look on!</LINE>
<LINE>It is a judgment main&#8217;d, and most imperfect,</LINE>
<LINE>That will confess perfection so could err</LINE>
<LINE>Against all rules of nature, and must be driven</LINE>
<LINE>To find out practices of cunning hell</LINE>
<LINE>Why this should be. I therefore vouch again</LINE>
<LINE>That with some mixtures pow&#8217;rful o&#8217;er the blood,</LINE>
<LINE>Or with some dram (conjur&#8217;d to this effect)</LINE>
<LINE>He wrought upon her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">To vouch this is no proof,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. SEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But, Othello, speak.</LINE>
<LINE>Did you by indirect and forced courses</LINE>
<LINE>Subdue and poison this young maid&#8217;s affections?</LINE>
<LINE>Or came it by request, and such fair question</LINE>
<LINE>As soul to soul affordeth?</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">I do beseech you,</LINE>

<LINE>The trust, the office I do hold of you,</LINE>

<LINE>And, till she come, as truly as to heaven</LINE>
<LINE>I do confess the vices of my blood,</LINE>
<LINE>So justly to your grave ears I&#8217;ll present</LINE>
<LINE>How I did thrive in this fair lady&#8217;s love,</LINE>
<LINE>And she in mine.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Her father lov&#8217;d me, oft invited me;</LINE>
<LINE>Still question&#8217;d me the story of my life</LINE>
<LINE>From year to year&#8212;the battles, sieges, fortunes,</LINE>
<LINE>That I have pass&#8217;d.</LINE>
<LINE>I ran it through, even from my boyish days</LINE>
<LINE>To th&#8217; very moment that he bade me tell it;</LINE>
<LINE>Wherein I spoke of most disastrous chances:</LINE>
<LINE>Of moving accidents by flood and field,</LINE>
<LINE>Of hair-breadth scapes i&#8217; th&#8217; imminent deadly breach,</LINE>
<LINE>Of being taken by the insolent foe</LINE>
<LINE>And sold to slavery, of my redemption thence</LINE>
<LINE>And portance in my travel&#8217;s history;</LINE>
<LINE>Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle,</LINE>
<LINE>Rough quarries, rocks, and hills whose heads touch heaven,</LINE>
<LINE>It was my hint to speak&#8212;such was my process&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>And of the Cannibals that each other eat,</LINE>
<LINE>The Anthropophagi, and men whose heads</LINE>
<LINE>Do grow beneath their shoulders. These things to hear</LINE>
<LINE>Would Desdemona seriously incline;</LINE>
<LINE>But still the house affairs would draw her thence,</LINE>
<LINE>Which ever as she could with haste dispatch,</LINE>
<LINE>She&#8217;ld come again, and with a greedy ear</LINE>
<LINE>Devour up my discourse. Which I observing,</LINE>
<LINE>Took once a pliant hour, and found good means</LINE>
<LINE>To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart</LINE>
<LINE>That I would all my pilgrimage dilate,</LINE>
<LINE>Whereof by parcels she had something heard,</LINE>
<LINE>But not intentively. I did consent,</LINE>
<LINE>And often did beguile her of her tears,</LINE>
<LINE>When I did speak of some distressful stroke</LINE>
<LINE>That my youth suffer&#8217;d. My story being done,</LINE>
<LINE>She gave me for my pains a world of sighs;</LINE>
<LINE>She swore, in faith &#8217;twas strange, &#8217;twas passing strange;</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Twas pitiful, &#8217;twas wondrous pitiful.</LINE>
<LINE>She wish&#8217;d she had not heard it, yet she wish&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>That heaven had made her such a man. She thank&#8217;d me,</LINE>
<LINE>And bade me, if I had a friend that lov&#8217;d her,</LINE>
<LINE>I should but teach him how to tell my story,</LINE>
<LINE>And that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake:</LINE>
<LINE>She lov&#8217;d me for the dangers I had pass&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>And I lov&#8217;d her that she did pity them.</LINE>
<LINE>This only is the witchcraft I have us&#8217;d.</LINE>
<LINE>Here comes the lady; let her witness it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Desdemona, Iago, Attendants.</STAGEDIR>


<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I think this tale would win my daughter too.</LINE>
<LINE>Good Brabantio,</LINE>

<LINE>Where most you owe obedience?</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">My noble father,</LINE>
<LINE>I do perceive here a divided duty:</LINE>
<LINE>To you I am bound for life and education;</LINE>
<LINE>My life and education both do learn me</LINE>
<LINE>How to respect you; you are the lord of duty;</LINE>
<LINE>I am hitherto your daughter. But here&#8217;s my husband;</LINE>
<LINE>And so much duty as my mother show&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>To you, preferring you before her father,</LINE>
<LINE>So much I challenge that I may profess</LINE>
<LINE>Due to the Moor, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRA.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">God be with you! I have done.</LINE>
<LINE>Please it your Grace, on to the state affairs.</LINE>
<LINE>I had rather to adopt a child than get it.</LINE>
<LINE>Come hither, Moor:</LINE>
<LINE>I here do give thee that with all my heart</LINE>
<LINE>Which but thou hast already, with all my heart</LINE>
<LINE>I would keep from thee. For your sake, jewel,</LINE>
<LINE>I am glad at soul I have no other child,</LINE>
<LINE>For thy escape would teach me tyranny,</LINE>
<LINE>To hang clogs on them. I have done, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let me speak like yourself, and lay a sentence,</LINE>
<LINE>Which as a grise or step, may help these lovers</LINE>
<LINE>Into your favor.</LINE>
<LINE>When remedies are past, the griefs are ended</LINE>
<LINE>By seeing the worst, which late on hopes depended.</LINE>
<LINE>To mourn a mischief that is past and gone</LINE>
<LINE>Is the next way to draw new mischief on.</LINE>
<LINE>What cannot be preserv&#8217;d when Fortune takes,</LINE>
<LINE>Patience her injury a mock&#8217;ry makes.</LINE>
<LINE>The robb&#8217;d that smiles steals something from the thief;</LINE>
<LINE>He robs himself that spends a bootless grief.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRA.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile,</LINE>
<LINE>We lose it not, so long as we can smile.</LINE>
<LINE>He bears the sentence well that nothing bears</LINE>
<LINE>But the free comfort which from thence he hears;</LINE>
<LINE>But he bears both the sentence and the sorrow</LINE>
<LINE>That, to pay grief, must of poor patience borrow.</LINE>
<LINE>These sentences, to sugar or to gall,</LINE>
<LINE>Being strong on both sides, are equivocal.</LINE>
<LINE>But words are words; I never yet did hear</LINE>
<LINE>That the bruis&#8217;d heart was pierced through the ear.</LINE>
<LINE>I humbly beseech you proceed to th&#8217; affairs of state.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The Turk with a most mighty preparation makes for Cyprus. Othello, the fortitude of the place is best known to you; and though we have there a substitute of most allow&#8217;d sufficiency, yet opinion, a sovereign mistress of effects, throws a more safer voice on you. You must therefore be content to slubber the gloss of your new fortunes with this more stubborn and boist&#8217;rous expedition.</LINE>

<LINE>I saw Othello&#8217;s visage in his mind,</LINE>

<LINE>Did I my soul and fortunes consecrate.</LINE>
<LINE>So that, dear lords, if I be left behind,</LINE>
<LINE>A moth of peace, and he go to the war,</LINE>
<LINE>The rites for why I love him are bereft me,</LINE>

<LINE>It is silliness to live, when to live is torment; and then have we a prescription to die, when death is our physician.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O villainous! I have look&#8217;d upon the world for four times seven years, and since I could distinguish betwixt a benefit and an injury, I never found man that knew how to love himself. Ere I would say I would drown myself for the love of a guinea hen, I would change my humanity with a baboon.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What should I do? I confess it is my shame to be so fond, but it is not in my virtue to amend it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Virtue? A fig! &#8217;tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus. Our bodies are our gardens, to the which our wills are gardeners; so that if we will plant nettles or sow lettuce, set hyssop and weed up tine, supply it with one gender of herbs or distract it with many, either to have it sterile with idleness or manur&#8217;d with industry&#8212;why, the power and corrigible authority of this lies in our wills. If the beam of our lives had not one scale of reason to poise another of sensuality, the blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us to most prepost&#8217;rous conclusions. But we have reason to cool our raging motions, our carnal stings, our unbitted lusts; whereof I take this that you call love to be a sect or scion.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It cannot be.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the will. Come, be a man! Drown thyself? Drown cats and blind puppies! I have profess&#8217;d me thy friend, and I confess me knit to thy deserving with cables of perdurable toughness. I could never better stead thee than now. Put money in thy purse; follow thou the wars; defeat thy favor with an usurp&#8217;d beard. I say put money in thy purse. It cannot be long that Desdemona should continue her love to the Moor&#8212;put money in thy purse&#8212;nor he his to her. It was a violent commencement in her, and thou shalt see an answerable sequestration&#8212;put but money in thy purse. These Moors are changeable in their wills&#8212;fill thy purse with money. The food that to him now is as luscious as locusts, shall be to him shortly as acerb as the coloquintida. She must change for youth; when she is sated with his body, she will find the error of her choice. She must have change, she must; therefore put money in thy purse. If thou wilt needs damn thyself, do it a more delicate way than drowning. Make all the money thou canst. If sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian and a super-subtle Venetian be not too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell, thou shalt enjoy her; therefore make money. A pox of drowning thyself, it is clean out of the way. Seek thou rather to be hang&#8217;d in compassing thy joy than to be drown&#8217;d and go without her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROD.</SPEAKER> 
<LINE>Wilt thou be fast to my hopes, if I depend on the issue?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou art sure of me&#8212;go make money. I have told thee often, and I retell thee again and again, I hate the Moor. My cause is hearted; thine hath no less reason. Let us be conjunctive in our revenge against him. If thou canst cuckold him, thou dost thyself a pleasure, me a sport. There are many events in the womb of time which will be deliver&#8217;d. Traverse, go, provide thy money. We will have more of this tomorrow. Adieu.</LINE>

If such tricks as these strip you out of your lieutenantry, it had been better you had not kiss&#8217;d your three fingers so oft, which now again you are most apt to play the sir in.

<LINE>May the winds blow till they have waken&#8217;d death!</LINE>
<LINE>And let the laboring bark climb hills of seas</LINE>
<LINE>Olympus-high, and duck again as low</LINE>
<LINE>As hell&#8217;s from heaven! If it were now to die,</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Twere now to be most happy; for I fear</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Come; let us to the castle.</LINE>
<LINE>News, friends: our wars are done; the Turks are drown&#8217;d.</LINE>
<LINE>How does my old acquaintance of this isle?</LINE>
<LINE>Honey, you shall be well desir&#8217;d in Cyprus,</LINE>
<LINE>I have found great love amongst them. O my sweet,</LINE>
<LINE>I prattle out of fashion, and I dote</LINE>
<LINE>In mine own comforts. I prithee, good Iago,</LINE>
<LINE>Go to the bay and disembark my coffers.</LINE>
<LINE>Bring thou the master to the citadel;</LINE>
<LINE>He is a good one, and his worthiness</LINE>
<LINE>Does challenge much respect. Come, Desdemona,</LINE>
<LINE>Once more, well met at Cyprus.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt Othello and Desdemona with all but Iago and Roderigo.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER> <STAGEDIR>To an Attendant, as he is going out.</STAGEDIR> <LINE>Do thou meet me presently at the harbor.&#8212;Come hither. If thou be&#8217;st valiant (as they say base men being in love have then a nobility in their natures more than is native to them), list me. The lieutenant tonight watches on the court of guard. First, I must tell thee this: Desdemona is directly in love with him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>With him? Why, &#8217;tis not possible.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Lay thy finger thus; and let thy soul be instructed. Mark me with what violence she first lov&#8217;d the Moor, but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies. To love him still for prating&#8212;let not thy discreet heart think it. Her eye must be fed; and what delight shall she have to look on the devil? When the blood is made dull with the act of sport, there should be, again to inflame it and to give satiety a fresh appetite, loveliness in favor, sympathy in years, manners, and beauties&#8212;all which the Moor is defective in. Now for want of these requir&#8217;d conveniences, her delicate tenderness will find itself abus&#8217;d, begin to heave the gorge, disrelish and abhor the Moor; very nature will instruct her in it and compel her to some second choice. Now, sir, this granted (as it is a most pregnant and unforc&#8217;d position), who stands so eminent in the degree of this fortune as Cassio does? A knave very voluble; no further conscionable than in putting on the mere form of civil and humane seeming, for the better compass of his salt and most hidden loose affection? Why, none, why, none&#8212;a slipper and subtle knave, a finder-out of occasion; that has an eye can stamp and counterfeit advantages, though true advantage never present itself; a devilish knave. Besides, the knave is handsome, young, and hath all those requisites in him that folly and green minds look after; a pestilent complete knave, and the woman hath found him already.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I cannot believe that in her, she&#8217;s full of most bless&#8217;d condition.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Bless&#8217;d fig&#8217;s-end! The wine she drinks is made of grapes. If she had been bless&#8217;d, she would never have lov&#8217;d the Moor. Bless&#8217;d pudding! Didst thou not see her paddle with the palm of his hand? Didst not mark that?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, that I did; but that was but courtesy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Lechery, by this hand; an index and obscure prologue to the history of lust and foul thoughts. They met so near with their lips that their breaths embrac&#8217;d together. Villainous thoughts, Roderigo! When these mutualities so marshal the way, hard at hand comes the master and main exercise, th&#8217; incorporate conclusion. Pish! But, sir, be you rul&#8217;d by me. I have brought you from Venice. Watch you tonight; for the command, I&#8217;ll lay&#8217;t upon you. Cassio knows you not. I&#8217;ll not be far from you. Do you find some occasion to anger Cassio, either by speaking too loud, or tainting his discipline, or from what other course you please, which the time shall more favorably minister.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, he&#8217;s rash and very sudden in choler, and happily may strike at you&#8212;provoke him that he may; for even out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to mutiny, whose qualification shall come into no true taste again but by the displanting of Cassio. So shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by the means I shall then have to prefer them; and the impediment most profitably remov&#8217;d, without the which there were no expectation of our prosperity.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will do this, if you can bring it to any opportunity.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I warrant thee. Meet me by and by at the citadel. I must fetch his necessaries ashore. Farewell.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That Cassio loves her, I do well believe&#8217;t;</LINE>
<LINE>That she loves him, &#8217;tis apt and of great credit.</LINE>
<LINE>The Moor (howbeit that I endure him not)</LINE>
<LINE>Is of a constant, loving, noble nature,</LINE>
<LINE>And I dare think he&#8217;ll prove to Desdemona</LINE>
<LINE>A most dear husband. Now I do love her too,</LINE>
<LINE>Not out of absolute lust (though peradventure</LINE>
<LINE>I stand accomptant for as great a sin),</LINE>
<LINE>But partly led to diet my revenge,</LINE>
<LINE>For that I do suspect the lusty Moor</LINE>
<LINE>Hath leap&#8217;d into my seat; the thought whereof</LINE>
<LINE>Doth (like a poisonous mineral) gnaw my inwards;</LINE>
<LINE>And nothing can or shall content my soul</LINE>
<LINE>Till I am even&#8217;d with him, wife for wife;</LINE>
<LINE>Or failing so, yet that I put the Moor</LINE>
<LINE>At least into a jealousy so strong</LINE>
<LINE>That judgment cannot cure. Which thing to do,</LINE>
<LINE>If this poor trash of Venice, whom I trace</LINE>
<LINE>For his quick hunting, stand the putting on,</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll have our Michael Cassio on the hip,</LINE>
<LINE>Abuse him to the Moor in the rank garb</LINE>
<LINE>(For I fear Cassio with my night-cap too),</LINE>
<LINE>Make the Moor thank me, love me, and reward me,</LINE>
<LINE>For making him egregiously an ass,</LINE>
<LINE>And practicing upon his peace and quiet</LINE>
<LINE>Even to madness. &#8217;Tis here; but yet confus&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Knavery&#8217;s plain face is never seen till us&#8217;d.</LINE>

So much was his pleasure should be proclaim&#8217;d. All offices are open, and there is full liberty of feasting from this present hour of five till the bell have told eleven.

<LINE>Welcome, Iago; we must to the watch.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not this hour, lieutenant; &#8217;tis not yet ten o&#8217; th&#8217; clock. Our general cast us thus early for the love of his Desdemona; who let us not therefore blame. He hath not yet made wanton the night with her; and she is sport for Jove.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She&#8217;s a most exquisite lady.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And I&#8217;ll warrant her, full of game.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Indeed she&#8217;s a most fresh and delicate creature.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What an eye she has! Methinks it sounds a parley to provocation.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>An inviting eye; and yet methinks right modest.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And when she speaks, is it not an alarum to love?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She is indeed perfection.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well&#8212;happiness to their sheets! Come, lieutenant, I have a stoup of wine, and here without are a brace of Cyprus gallants that would fain have a measure to the health of black Othello.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not tonight, good Iago, I have very poor and unhappy brains for drinking. I could well wish courtesy would invent some other custom of entertainment.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, they are our friends&#8212;but one cup, I&#8217;ll drink for you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have drunk but one cup tonight&#8212;and that was craftily qualified too&#8212;and behold what innovation it makes here. I am infortunate in the infirmity, and dare not task my weakness with any more.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, man? &#8217;Tis a night of revels, the gallants desire it.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here, at the door; I pray you call them in.</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>If I can fasten but one cup upon him,</LINE>
<LINE>With that which he hath drunk tonight already,</LINE>
<LINE>He&#8217;ll be as full of quarrel and offense</LINE>
<LINE>As my young mistress&#8217; dog. Now, my sick fool Roderigo,</LINE>
<LINE>Whom love hath turn&#8217;d almost the wrong side out,</LINE>
<LINE>To Desdemona hath tonight carous&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>Potations pottle-deep; and he&#8217;s to watch.</LINE>
<LINE>Three else of Cyprus, noble swelling spirits</LINE>
<LINE>That hold their honors in a wary distance,</LINE>
<LINE>The very elements of this warlike isle,</LINE>
<LINE>Have I tonight fluster&#8217;d with flowing cups,</LINE>
<LINE>And they watch too. Now &#8217;mongst this flock of drunkards</LINE>
<LINE>Am I to put our Cassio in some action</LINE>
<LINE>That may offend the isle. But here they come.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Cassio, Montano, and Gentlemen; Servants follow with wine.</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>I learn&#8217;d it in England, where indeed they are most potent in potting; your Dane, your German, and your swag-bellied Hollander&#8212;Drink ho!&#8212;are nothing to your English.</LINE>

<LINE>Is your Englishman so exquisite in his drinking?</LINE>

<LINE>Ay; but by your leave, not before me; the lieutenant is to be sav&#8217;d before the ancient.

Do not think, gentlemen, I am drunk: this is my ancient, this is my right hand, and this is my left hand. I am not drunk now; I can stand well enough, and I speak well enough.</LINE>

<LINE>Excellent well.</LINE>

<LINE>&#8217;Tis to his virtue a just equinox,</LINE>
<LINE>The one as long as th&#8217; other. &#8217;Tis pity of him.</LINE>
<LINE>I fear the trust Othello puts him in,</LINE>

<LINE>(As if some planet had unwitted men),</LINE>
<LINE>Swords out, and tilting one at other&#8217;s breast,</LINE>
<LINE>In opposition bloody. I cannot speak</LINE>

<LINE>Worthy Montano, you were wont to be civil;</LINE>
<LINE>The gravity and stillness of your youth</LINE>
<LINE>The world hath noted, and your name is great</LINE>
<LINE>In mouths of wisest censure. What&#8217;s the matter</LINE>
<LINE>That you unlace your reputation thus,</LINE>
<LINE>And spend your rich opinion for the name</LINE>
<LINE>Of a night-brawler? Give me answer to it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Worthy Othello, I am hurt to danger.</LINE>
<LINE>Your officer, Iago, can inform you&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>While I spare speech, which something now offends me&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Of all that I do know, nor know I aught</LINE>
<LINE>By me that&#8217;s said or done amiss this night,</LINE>
<LINE>Unless self-charity be sometimes a vice,</LINE>
<LINE>And to defend ourselves it be a sin</LINE>

<LINE offset="5">Now by heaven,</LINE>
<LINE>My blood begins my safer guides to rule,</LINE>

<LINE>Assays to lead the way. &#8217;Zounds, if I stir,</LINE>
<LINE>Or do but lift this arm, the best of you</LINE>
<LINE>Shall sink in my rebuke. Give me to know</LINE>
<LINE>How this foul rout began; who set it on;</LINE>
<LINE>And he that is approv&#8217;d in this offense,</LINE>
<LINE>Though he had twinn&#8217;d with me, both at a birth,</LINE>
<LINE>Shall lose me. What, in a town of war,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet wild, the people&#8217;s hearts brimful of fear,</LINE>
<LINE>To manage private and domestic quarrel?</LINE>
<LINE>In night, and on the court and guard of safety?</LINE>

<LINE offset="4">Touch me not so near;</LINE>
<LINE>I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth</LINE>
<LINE>Than it should do offense to Michael Cassio;</LINE>
<LINE>Yet I persuade myself, to speak the truth</LINE>
<LINE>Shall nothing wrong him. Thus it is, general:</LINE>
<LINE>Montano and myself being in speech,</LINE>
<LINE>There comes a fellow crying out for help,</LINE>
<LINE>And Cassio following him with determin&#8217;d sword</LINE>
<LINE>To execute upon him. Sir, this gentleman</LINE>
<LINE>Steps in to Cassio and entreats his pause;</LINE>
<LINE>Myself the crying fellow did pursue,</LINE>
<LINE>Lest by his clamor (as it so fell out)</LINE>
<LINE>The town might fall in fright. He, swift of foot,</LINE>
<LINE>Outran my purpose; and I return&#8217;d the rather</LINE>
<LINE>For that I heard the clink and fall of swords,</LINE>
<LINE>And Cassio high in oath; which till tonight</LINE>
<LINE>I ne&#8217;er might say before. When I came back</LINE>
<LINE>(For this was brief), I found them close together</LINE>
<LINE>At blow and thrust, even as again they were</LINE>
<LINE>When you yourself did part them.</LINE>
<LINE>More of this matter cannot I report.</LINE>
<LINE>But men are men; the best sometimes forget.</LINE>
<LINE>Though Cassio did some little wrong to him,</LINE>
<LINE>As men in rage strike those that wish them best,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet surely Cassio, I believe, receiv&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>From him that fled some strange indignity</LINE>
<LINE>Which patience could not pass.</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As I am an honest man, I had thought you had receiv&#8217;d some bodily wound; there is more sense in that than in reputation. Reputation is an idle and most false imposition; oft got without merit, and lost without deserving. You have lost no reputation at all, unless you repute yourself such a loser. What, man, there are more ways to recover the general again. You are but now cast in his mood, a punishment more in policy than in malice, even so as one would beat his offenseless dog to affright an imperious lion. Sue to him again, and he&#8217;s yours.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will rather sue to be despis&#8217;d than to deceive so good a commander with so slight, so drunken, and so indiscreet an officer. Drunk? And speak parrot? And squabble? Swagger? Swear? And discourse fustian with one&#8217;s own shadow? O thou invisible spirit of wine, if thou hast no name to be known by, let us call thee devil!</LINE>

<LINE>Is&#8217;t possible?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I remember a mass of things, but nothing distinctly; a quarrel, but nothing wherefore. O God, that men should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away their brains! That we should, with joy, pleasance, revel, and applause, transform ourselves into beasts!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, but you are now well enough. How came you thus recover&#8217;d?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It hath pleas&#8217;d the devil drunkenness to give place to the devil wrath: one unperfectness shows me another, to make me frankly despise myself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, you are too severe a moraler. As the time, the place, and the condition of this country stands, I could heartily wish this had not befall&#8217;n; but since it is as it is, mend it for your own good.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will ask him for my place again, he shall tell me I am a drunkard! Had I as many mouths as Hydra, such an answer would stop them all. To be now a sensible man, by and by a fool, and presently a beast! O strange! Every inordinate cup is unbless&#8217;d, and the ingredient is a devil.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, come; good wine is a good familiar creature, if it be well us&#8217;d; exclaim no more against it. And, good lieutenant, I think you think I love you.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have well approv&#8217;d it, sir. I drunk!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You, or any man living, may be drunk at a time, man. I&#8217;ll tell you what you shall do. Our general&#8217;s wife is now the general&#8212;I may say so in this respect, for that he hath devoted and given up himself to the contemplation, mark, and denotement of her parts and graces. Confess yourself freely to her; importune her help to put you in your place again. She is of so free, so kind, so apt, so bless&#8217;d a disposition, she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more than she is requested. This broken joint between you and her husband entreat her to splinter; and my fortunes against any lay worth naming, this crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You advise me well.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I protest, in the sincerity of love and honest kindness.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I think it freely; and betimes in the morning I will beseech the virtuous Desdemona to undertake for me. I am desperate of my fortunes if they check me here.</LINE>

<LINE>You are in the right. Good night, lieutenant, I must to the watch.</LINE>

<LINE>And what&#8217;s he then that says I play the villain,</LINE>
<LINE>When this advice is free I give, and honest,</LINE>
<LINE>Probal to thinking, and indeed the course</LINE>
<LINE>To win the Moor again? For &#8217;tis most easy</LINE>
<LINE>Th&#8217; inclining Desdemona to subdue</LINE>
<LINE>In any honest suit; she&#8217;s fram&#8217;d as fruitful</LINE>
<LINE>As the free elements. And then for her</LINE>
<LINE>To win the Moor, were&#8217;t to renounce his baptism,</LINE>
<LINE>All seals and symbols of redeemed sin,</LINE>
<LINE>His soul is so enfetter&#8217;d to her love,</LINE>
<LINE>That she may make, unmake, do what she list,</LINE>
<LINE>Even as her appetite shall play the god</LINE>
<LINE>With his weak function. How am I then a villain,</LINE>
<LINE>To counsel Cassio to this parallel course,</LINE>
<LINE>Directly to his good? Divinity of hell!</LINE>
<LINE>When devils will the blackest sins put on,</LINE>
<LINE>They do suggest at first with heavenly shows,</LINE>
<LINE>As I do now; for whiles this honest fool</LINE>
<LINE>Plies Desdemona to repair his fortune,</LINE>
<LINE>And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor,</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll pour this pestilence into his ear&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>That she repeals him for her body&#8217;s lust,</LINE>
<LINE>And by how much she strives to do him good,</LINE>
<LINE>She shall undo her credit with the Moor.</LINE>
<LINE>So will I turn her virtue into pitch,</LINE>
<LINE>And out of her own goodness make the net</LINE>
<LINE>That shall enmesh them all.</LINE>

<LINE>How now, Roderigo?</LINE>

<LINE>I do follow here in the chase, not like a hound that hunts, but one that fills up the cry. My money is almost spent; I have been tonight exceedingly well cudgell&#8217;d; and I think the issue will be, I shall have so much experience for my pains; and so, with no money at all and a little more wit, return again to Venice.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How poor are they that have not patience!</LINE>
<LINE>What wound did ever heal but by degrees?</LINE>
<LINE>Thou know&#8217;st we work by wit, and not by witchcraft,</LINE>
<LINE>And wit depends on dilatory time.</LINE>
<LINE>Does&#8217;t not go well? Cassio hath beaten thee,</LINE>
<LINE>And thou by that small hurt hast cashier&#8217;d Cassio.</LINE>
<LINE>Though other things grow fair against the sun,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe.</LINE>
<LINE>Content thyself a while. By the mass, &#8217;tis morning;</LINE>
<LINE>Pleasure and action make the hours seem short.</LINE>
<LINE>Retire thee, go where thou art billeted.</LINE>

<LINE>Seeing your coming.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">I do believe &#8217;twas he.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How now, my lord?</LINE>
<LINE>I have been talking with a suitor here,</LINE>
<LINE>A man that languishes in your displeasure.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who is&#8217;t you mean?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, your lieutenant, Cassio. Good my lord,</LINE>
<LINE>If I have any grace or power to move you,</LINE>
<LINE>His present reconciliation take;</LINE>
<LINE>For if he be not one that truly loves you,</LINE>
<LINE>That errs in ignorance and not in cunning,</LINE>
<LINE>I have no judgment in an honest face.</LINE>
<LINE>I prithee call him back.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Went he hence now?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, faith; so humbled</LINE>
<LINE>That he hath left part of his grief with me</LINE>
<LINE>To suffer with him. Good love, call him back.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not now, sweet Desdemon, some other time.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But shall&#8217;t be shortly?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">The sooner, sweet, for you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Shall&#8217;t be tonight at supper?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">No, not tonight.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tomorrow dinner then?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">I shall not dine at home;</LINE>
<LINE>I meet the captains at the citadel.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why then tomorrow night, or Tuesday morn;</LINE>
<LINE>On Tuesday noon, or night; on We&#8217;n&#8217;sday morn.</LINE>
<LINE>I prithee name the time, but let it not</LINE>
<LINE>Exceed three days. In faith, he&#8217;s penitent;</LINE>
<LINE>And yet his trespass, in our common reason</LINE>
<LINE>(Save that they say the wars must make example</LINE>
<LINE>Out of her best), is not almost a fault</LINE>
<LINE>T&#8217; incur a private check. When shall he come?</LINE>
<LINE>Tell me, Othello. I wonder in my soul</LINE>
<LINE>What you would ask me that I should deny,</LINE>
<LINE>Or stand so mamm&#8217;ring on. What? Michael Cassio,</LINE>
<LINE>That came a-wooing with you, and so many a time,</LINE>
<LINE>When I have spoke of you dispraisingly,</LINE>
<LINE>Hath ta&#8217;en your part&#8212;to have so much to do</LINE>
<LINE>To bring him in! By&#8217;r lady, I could do much&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Prithee no more; let him come when he will;</LINE>
<LINE>I will deny thee nothing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Why, this is not a boon;</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves,</LINE>
<LINE>Or feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm,</LINE>
<LINE>Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit</LINE>
<LINE>To your own person. Nay, when I have a suit</LINE>
<LINE>Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed,</LINE>
<LINE>It shall be full of poise and difficult weight,</LINE>
<LINE>And fearful to be granted.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">I will deny thee nothing;</LINE>
<LINE>Whereon, I do beseech thee, grant me this,</LINE>
<LINE>To leave me but a little to myself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Shall I deny you? No. Farewell, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Farewell, my Desdemona, I&#8217;ll come to thee straight.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Emilia, come.&#8212;Be as your fancies teach you;</LINE>
<LINE>What e&#8217;er you be, I am obedient.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit with Emilia.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul</LINE>
<LINE>But I do love thee! And when I love thee not,</LINE>
<LINE>Chaos is come again.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My noble lord&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">What dost thou say, Iago?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Did Michael Cassio, when you woo&#8217;d my lady,</LINE>
<LINE>Know of your love?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He did, from first to last. Why dost thou ask?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But for a satisfaction of my thought,</LINE>
<LINE>No further harm.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Why of thy thought, Iago?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I did not think he had been acquainted with her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O yes, and went between us very oft.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Indeed!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Indeed? Ay, indeed. Discern&#8217;st thou aught in that?</LINE>
<LINE>Is he not honest?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Honest, my lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Honest? Ay, honest.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">My lord, for aught I know.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What dost thou think?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Think, my lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Think, my lord? By heaven, thou echo&#8217;st me,</LINE>
<LINE>As if there were some monster in thy thought</LINE>
<LINE>Too hideous to be shown. Thou dost mean something.</LINE>
<LINE>I heard thee say even now, thou lik&#8217;st not that,</LINE>
<LINE>When Cassio left my wife. What didst not like?</LINE>
<LINE>And when I told thee he was of my counsel</LINE>
<LINE>In my whole course of wooing, thou criedst, &#8220;Indeed!&#8221;</LINE>
<LINE>And didst contract and purse thy brow together,</LINE>
<LINE>As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain</LINE>
<LINE>Some horrible conceit. If thou dost love me,</LINE>
<LINE>Show me thy thought.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, you know I love you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">I think thou dost;</LINE>
<LINE>And for I know thou&#8217;rt full of love and honesty,</LINE>
<LINE>And weigh&#8217;st thy words before thou giv&#8217;st them breath,</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more;</LINE>
<LINE>For such things in a false disloyal knave</LINE>
<LINE>Are tricks of custom; but in a man that&#8217;s just</LINE>
<LINE>They&#8217;re close dilations, working from the heart,</LINE>
<LINE>That passion cannot rule.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">For Michael Cassio,</LINE>
<LINE>I dare be sworn I think that he is honest.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I think so too.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="3">Men should be what they seem,</LINE>
<LINE>Or those that be not, would they might seem none!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Certain, men should be what they seem.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why then I think Cassio&#8217;s an honest man.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, yet there&#8217;s more in this.</LINE>
<LINE>I prithee speak to me as to thy thinkings,</LINE>
<LINE>As thou dost ruminate, and give thy worst of thoughts</LINE>
<LINE>The worst of words.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Good my lord, pardon me:</LINE>
<LINE>Though I am bound to every act of duty,</LINE>
<LINE>I am not bound to that all slaves are free to.</LINE>
<LINE>Utter my thoughts? Why, say they are vild and false,</LINE>
<LINE>As where&#8217;s that palace whereinto foul things</LINE>
<LINE>Sometimes intrude not? Who has that breast so pure</LINE>
<LINE>But some uncleanly apprehensions</LINE>
<LINE>Keep leets and law-days and in sessions sit</LINE>
<LINE>With meditations lawful?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago,</LINE>
<LINE>If thou but think&#8217;st him wrong&#8217;d, and mak&#8217;st his ear</LINE>
<LINE>A stranger to thy thoughts.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">I do beseech you,</LINE>
<LINE>Though I perchance am vicious in my guess</LINE>
<LINE>(As I confess it is my nature&#8217;s plague</LINE>
<LINE>To spy into abuses, and oft my jealousy</LINE>
<LINE>Shapes faults that are not), that your wisdom then,</LINE>
<LINE>From one that so imperfectly conjects,</LINE>
<LINE>Would take no notice, nor build yourself a trouble</LINE>
<LINE>Out of his scattering and unsure observance.</LINE>
<LINE>It were not for your quiet nor your good,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor for my manhood, honesty, and wisdom,</LINE>
<LINE>To let you know my thoughts.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;Zounds, what dost thou mean?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good name in man and woman, dear my lord,</LINE>
<LINE>Is the immediate jewel of their souls.</LINE>
<LINE>Who steals my purse steals trash; &#8217;tis something, nothing;</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Twas mine, &#8217;tis his, and has been slave to thousands;</LINE>
<LINE>But he that filches from me my good name</LINE>
<LINE>Robs me of that which not enriches him,</LINE>
<LINE>And makes me poor indeed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By heaven, I&#8217;ll know thy thoughts.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You cannot, if my heart were in your hand,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor shall not, whilst &#8217;tis in my custody.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ha?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="2">O, beware, my lord, of jealousy!</LINE>
<LINE>It is the green-ey&#8217;d monster which doth mock</LINE>
<LINE>The meat it feeds on. That cuckold lives in bliss</LINE>
<LINE>Who, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger;</LINE>
<LINE>But O, what damned minutes tells he o&#8217;er</LINE>
<LINE>Who dotes, yet doubts; suspects, yet strongly loves!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O misery!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Poor and content is rich, and rich enough,</LINE>
<LINE>But riches fineless is as poor as winter</LINE>
<LINE>To him that ever fears he shall be poor.</LINE>
<LINE>Good God, the souls of all my tribe defend</LINE>
<LINE>From jealousy!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="3">Why? Why is this?</LINE>
<LINE>Think&#8217;st thou I&#8217;d make a life of jealousy?</LINE>
<LINE>To follow still the changes of the moon</LINE>
<LINE>With fresh suspicions? No! To be once in doubt</LINE>
<LINE>Is once to be resolv&#8217;d. Exchange me for a goat,</LINE>
<LINE>When I shall turn the business of my soul</LINE>
<LINE>To such exsufflicate and blown surmises,</LINE>
<LINE>Matching thy inference. &#8217;Tis not to make me jealous</LINE>
<LINE>To say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company,</LINE>
<LINE>Is free of speech, sings, plays, and dances well;</LINE>
<LINE>Where virtue is, these are more virtuous.</LINE>
<LINE>Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw</LINE>
<LINE>The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt,</LINE>
<LINE>For she had eyes, and chose me. No, Iago,</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll see before I doubt; when I doubt, prove;</LINE>
<LINE>And on the proof, there is no more but this&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Away at once with love or jealousy!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am glad of this, for now I shall have reason</LINE>
<LINE>To show the love and duty that I bear you</LINE>
<LINE>With franker spirit; therefore (as I am bound)</LINE>
<LINE>Receive it from me. I speak not yet of proof.</LINE>
<LINE>Look to your wife, observe her well with Cassio,</LINE>
<LINE>Wear your eyes thus, not jealious nor secure.</LINE>
<LINE>I would not have your free and noble nature,</LINE>
<LINE>Out of self-bounty, be abus&#8217;d; look to&#8217;t.</LINE>
<LINE>I know our country disposition well:</LINE>
<LINE>In Venice they do let God see the pranks</LINE>
<LINE>They dare not show their husbands; their best conscience</LINE>
<LINE>Is not to leave&#8217;t undone, but keep&#8217;t unknown.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Dost thou say so?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She did deceive her father, marrying you,</LINE>
<LINE>And when she seem&#8217;d to shake and fear your looks,</LINE>
<LINE>She lov&#8217;d them most.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">And so she did.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="8">Why, go to then.</LINE>
<LINE>She that so young could give out such a seeming</LINE>
<LINE>To seel her father&#8217;s eyes up, close as oak,</LINE>
<LINE>He thought &#8217;twas witchcraft&#8212;but I am much to blame;</LINE>
<LINE>I humbly do beseech you of your pardon</LINE>
<LINE>For too much loving you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">I am bound to thee forever.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I see this hath a little dash&#8217;d your spirits.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not a jot, not a jot.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">I&#8217; faith, I fear it has.</LINE>
<LINE>I hope you will consider what is spoke</LINE>
<LINE>Comes from my love. But I do see y&#8217; are mov&#8217;d.</LINE>
<LINE>I am to pray you not to strain my speech</LINE>
<LINE>To grosser issues nor to larger reach</LINE>
<LINE>Than to suspicion.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="3">Should you do so, my lord,</LINE>
<LINE>My speech should fall into such vild success</LINE>
<LINE>Which my thoughts aim&#8217;d not. Cassio&#8217;s my worthy friend&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>My lord, I see y&#8217; are mov&#8217;d.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">No, not much mov&#8217;d:</LINE>
<LINE>I do not think but Desdemona&#8217;s honest.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Long live she so! And long live you to think so!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And yet how nature erring from itself&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, there&#8217;s the point; as (to be bold with you)</LINE>
<LINE>Not to affect many proposed matches</LINE>
<LINE>Of her own clime, complexion, and degree,</LINE>
<LINE>Whereto we see in all things nature tends&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Foh, one may smell in such, a will most rank,</LINE>
<LINE>Foul disproportions, thoughts unnatural.</LINE>
<LINE>But (pardon me) I do not in position</LINE>
<LINE>Distinctly speak of her, though I may fear</LINE>
<LINE>Her will, recoiling to her better judgment,</LINE>
<LINE>May fall to match you with her country forms,</LINE>
<LINE>And happily repent.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Farewell, farewell!</LINE>
<LINE>If more thou dost perceive, let me know more;</LINE>
<LINE>Set on thy wife to observe. Leave me, Iago.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER> <STAGEDIR>Going.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>My lord, I take my leave.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why did I marry? This honest creature, doubtless,</LINE>
<LINE>Sees and knows more, much more, than he unfolds.</LINE>


<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER> <STAGEDIR>Returning.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>My lord, I would I might entreat your honor</LINE>
<LINE>To scan this thing no farther; leave it to time.</LINE>
<LINE>Although &#8217;tis fit that Cassio have his place&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>For sure he fills it up with great ability&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Yet if you please to hold him off awhile,</LINE>
<LINE>You shall by that perceive him and his means.</LINE>
<LINE>Note if your lady strain his entertainment</LINE>
<LINE>With any strong or vehement importunity;</LINE>
<LINE>Much will be seen in that. In the mean time,</LINE>
<LINE>Let me be thought too busy in my fears</LINE>
<LINE>(As worthy cause I have to fear I am)</LINE>
<LINE>And hold her free, I do beseech your honor.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fear not my government.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I once more take my leave.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This fellow&#8217;s of exceeding honesty,</LINE>
<LINE>And knows all qualities, with a learned spirit,</LINE>
<LINE>Of human dealings. If I do prove her haggard,</LINE>
<LINE>Though that her jesses were my dear heart-strings,</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ld whistle her off, and let her down the wind</LINE>
<LINE>To prey at fortune. Haply, for I am black,</LINE>
<LINE>And have not those soft parts of conversation</LINE>
<LINE>That chamberers have, or for I am declin&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>Into the vale of years (yet that&#8217;s not much),</LINE>
<LINE>She&#8217;s gone. I am abus&#8217;d, and my relief</LINE>
<LINE>Must be to loathe her. O curse of marriage!</LINE>
<LINE>That we can call these delicate creatures ours,</LINE>
<LINE>And not their appetites! I had rather be a toad</LINE>
<LINE>And live upon the vapor of a dungeon</LINE>
<LINE>Than keep a corner in the thing I love</LINE>
<LINE>For others&#8217; uses. Yet &#8217;tis the plague of great ones,</LINE>
<LINE>Prerogativ&#8217;d are they less than the base;</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis destiny unshunnable, like death.</LINE>
<LINE>Even then this forked plague is fated to us</LINE>
<LINE>When we do quicken. Look where she comes:</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Desdemona and Emilia.</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>If she be false, O then heaven mocks itself!</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll not believe&#8217;t.</LINE>

<LINE>Your dinner, and the generous islanders</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exit with Othello.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EMIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am glad I have found this napkin;</LINE>
<LINE>This was her first remembrance from the Moor.</LINE>
<LINE>My wayward husband hath a hundred times</LINE>
<LINE>Woo&#8217;d me to steal it; but she so loves the token</LINE>
<LINE>(For he conjur&#8217;d her she should ever keep it)</LINE>
<LINE>That she reserves it evermore about her</LINE>
<LINE>To kiss and talk to. I&#8217;ll have the work ta&#8217;en out,</LINE>
<LINE>And give&#8217;t Iago. What he will do with it</LINE>
<LINE>Heaven knows, not I;</LINE>
<LINE>I nothing but to please his fantasy.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Iago.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How now? What do you here alone?</LINE>

<LINE>To have a foolish wife.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EMIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, is that all? What will you give me now</LINE>
<LINE>For that same handkerchief?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EMIL.</SPEAKER>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hast stol&#8217;n it from her?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EMIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, faith; she let it drop by negligence,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EMIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What will you do with&#8217;t, that you have been so earnest</LINE>
<LINE>To have me filch it?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER> <STAGEDIR>Snatching it.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE offset="4">Why, what is that to you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EMIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If it be not for some purpose of import,</LINE>
<LINE>Give&#8217;t me again. Poor lady, she&#8217;ll run mad</LINE>
<LINE>When she shall lack it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Be not acknown on&#8217;t; I have use for it.</LINE>
<LINE>Go, leave me.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exit Emilia.</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>I will in Cassio&#8217;s lodging lose this napkin,</LINE>
<LINE>And let him find it. Trifles light as air</LINE>
<LINE>Are to the jealious confirmations strong</LINE>
<LINE>As proofs of holy writ; this may do something.</LINE>
<LINE>The Moor already changes with my poison:</LINE>
<LINE>Dangerous conceits are in their natures poisons,</LINE>
<LINE>Which at the first are scarce found to distaste,</LINE>
<LINE>But with a little act upon the blood</LINE>
<LINE>Burn like the mines of sulphur.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Othello.</STAGEDIR>

<LINE offset="7">I did say so.</LINE>
<LINE>Look where he comes! Not poppy, nor mandragora,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world</LINE>
<LINE>Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep</LINE>
<LINE>Which thou ow&#8217;dst yesterday.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">Ha, ha, false to me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, how now, general? No more of that.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Avaunt, be gone! Thou hast set me on the rack.</LINE>
<LINE>I swear &#8217;tis better to be much abus&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>Than but to know&#8217;t a little.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">How now, my lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What sense had I in her stol&#8217;n hours of lust?</LINE>
<LINE>I saw&#8217;t not, thought it not; it harm&#8217;d not me.</LINE>
<LINE>I slept the next night well, fed well, was free and merry;</LINE>
<LINE>I found not Cassio&#8217;s kisses on her lips.</LINE>
<LINE>He that is robb&#8217;d, not wanting what is stol&#8217;n,</LINE>
<LINE>Let him not know&#8217;t, and he&#8217;s not robb&#8217;d at all.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am sorry to hear this.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I had been happy, if the general camp,</LINE>
<LINE>Pioners and all, had tasted her sweet body,</LINE>
<LINE>So I had nothing known. O now, forever</LINE>
<LINE>Farewell the tranquil mind! Farewell content!</LINE>
<LINE>Farewell the plumed troops and the big wars</LINE>
<LINE>That makes ambition virtue! O, farewell!</LINE>
<LINE>Farewell the neighing steed and the shrill trump,</LINE>
<LINE>The spirit-stirring drum, th&#8217; ear-piercing fife,</LINE>
<LINE>The royal banner, and all quality,</LINE>
<LINE>Pride, pomp, and circumstance of glorious war!</LINE>
<LINE>And O you mortal engines, whose rude throats</LINE>
<LINE>Th&#8217; immortal Jove&#8217;s dread clamors counterfeit,</LINE>
<LINE>Farewell! Othello&#8217;s occupation&#8217;s gone.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is&#8217;t possible, my lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Villain, be sure thou prove my love a whore;</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Taking him by the throat.</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>Be sure of it. Give me the ocular proof,</LINE>
<LINE>Or by the worth of mine eternal soul,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou hadst been better have been born a dog</LINE>
<LINE>Than answer my wak&#8217;d wrath!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">is&#8217;t come to this?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Make me to see&#8217;t; or (at the least) so prove it</LINE>
<LINE>That the probation bear no hinge nor loop</LINE>
<LINE>To hang a doubt on; or woe upon thy life!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My noble lord&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If thou dost slander her and torture me,</LINE>
<LINE>Never pray more; abandon all remorse;</LINE>
<LINE>On horror&#8217;s head horrors accumulate;</LINE>
<LINE>Do deeds to make heaven weep, all earth amaz&#8217;d;</LINE>
<LINE>For nothing canst thou to damnation add</LINE>
<LINE>Greater than that.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">O grace! O heaven forgive me!</LINE>
<LINE>Are you a man? Have you a soul? Or sense?</LINE>
<LINE>God buy you; take mine office. O wretched fool,</LINE>
<LINE>That lov&#8217;st to make thine honesty a vice!</LINE>
<LINE>O monstrous world! Take note, take note, O world,</LINE>
<LINE>To be direct and honest is not safe.</LINE>
<LINE>I thank you for this profit, and from hence</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll love no friend, sith love breeds such offense.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, stay. Thou shouldst be honest.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I should be wise&#8212;for honesty&#8217;s a fool</LINE>
<LINE>And loses that it works for.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">By the world,</LINE>
<LINE>I think my wife be honest, and think she is not;</LINE>
<LINE>I think that thou art just, and think thou art not.</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll have some proof. Her name, that was as fresh</LINE>
<LINE>As Dian&#8217;s visage, is now begrim&#8217;d and black</LINE>
<LINE>As mine own face. If there be cords, or knives,</LINE>
<LINE>Poison, or fire, or suffocating streams,</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll not endure it. Would I were satisfied!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I see, sir, you are eaten up with passion;</LINE>
<LINE>I do repent me that I put it to you.</LINE>
<LINE>You would be satisfied?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Would? Nay, and I will.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And may; but how? How satisfied, my lord?</LINE>
<LINE>Would you, the supervisor, grossly gape on?</LINE>
<LINE>Behold her topp&#8217;d?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Death and damnation! O!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It were a tedious difficulty, I think,</LINE>
<LINE>To bring them to that prospect; damn them then,</LINE>
<LINE>If ever mortal eyes do see them bolster</LINE>
<LINE>More than their own. What then? How then?</LINE>
<LINE>What shall I say? Where&#8217;s satisfaction?</LINE>
<LINE>It is impossible you should see this,</LINE>
<LINE>Were they as prime as goats, as hot as monkeys,</LINE>
<LINE>As salt as wolves in pride, and fools as gross</LINE>
<LINE>As ignorance made drunk. But yet, I say,</LINE>
<LINE>If imputation and strong circumstances</LINE>
<LINE>Which lead directly to the door of truth</LINE>
<LINE>Will give you satisfaction, you might have&#8217;t.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Give me a living reason she&#8217;s disloyal.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do not like the office;</LINE>
<LINE>But sith I am ent&#8217;red in this cause so far</LINE>
<LINE>(Prick&#8217;d to&#8217;t by foolish honesty and love),</LINE>
<LINE>I will go on. I lay with Cassio lately,</LINE>
<LINE>And being troubled with a raging tooth,</LINE>
<LINE>I could not sleep.</LINE>
<LINE>There are a kind of men, so loose of soul,</LINE>
<LINE>That in their sleeps will mutter their affairs;</LINE>
<LINE>One of this kind is Cassio.</LINE>
<LINE>In sleep I heard him say, &#8220;Sweet Desdemona,</LINE>
<LINE>Let us be wary, let us hide our loves&#8221;;</LINE>
<LINE>And then, sir, would he gripe and wring my hand;</LINE>
<LINE>Cry, &#8220;O sweet creature!&#8221; then kiss me hard,</LINE>
<LINE>As if he pluck&#8217;d up kisses by the roots</LINE>
<LINE>That grew upon my lips; then laid his leg</LINE>
<LINE>Over my thigh, and sigh&#8217;d, and kiss&#8217;d, and then</LINE>
<LINE>Cried, &#8220;Cursed fate that gave thee to the Moor!&#8221;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O monstrous! Monstrous!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Nay, this was but his dream.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But this denoted a foregone conclusion.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis a shrewd doubt, though it be but a dream,</LINE>
<LINE>And this may help to thicken other proofs</LINE>
<LINE>That do demonstrate thinly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">I&#8217;ll tear her all to pieces.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, yet be wise; yet we see nothing done;</LINE>
<LINE>She may be honest yet. Tell me but this,</LINE>
<LINE>Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief</LINE>
<LINE>Spotted with strawberries in your wive&#8217;s hand?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I gave her such a one; &#8217;twas my first gift.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know not that; but such a handkerchief</LINE>
<LINE>(I am sure it was your wive&#8217;s) did I today</LINE>
<LINE>See Cassio wipe his beard with.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">If it be that&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If it be that, or any that was hers,</LINE>
<LINE>It speaks against her with the other proofs.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O that the slave had forty thousand lives!</LINE>
<LINE>One is too poor, too weak for my revenge.</LINE>
<LINE>Now do I see &#8217;tis true. Look here, Iago,</LINE>
<LINE>All my fond love thus do I blow to heaven.</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis gone.</LINE>
<LINE>Arise, black vengeance, from the hollow hell!</LINE>
<LINE>Yield up, O love, thy crown and hearted throne</LINE>
<LINE>To tyrannous hate! Swell, bosom, with thy fraught,</LINE>
<LINE>For &#8217;tis of aspics&#8217; tongues!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Yet be content.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O blood, blood, blood!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Patience, I say; your mind perhaps may change.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Never, Iago. Like to the Pontic Sea,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose icy current and compulsive course</LINE>
<LINE>Nev&#8217;r feels retiring ebb, but keeps due on</LINE>
<LINE>To the Propontic and the Hellespont,</LINE>
<LINE>Even so my bloody thoughts, with violent pace,</LINE>
<LINE>Shall nev&#8217;r look back, nev&#8217;r ebb to humble love,</LINE>
<LINE>Till that a capable and wide revenge</LINE>
<LINE>Swallow them up.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>He kneels.</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>Now by yond marble heaven,</LINE>
<LINE>In the due reverence of a sacred vow</LINE>
<LINE>I here engage my words.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Do not rise yet.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Iago kneels.</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>Witness, you ever-burning lights above,</LINE>
<LINE>You elements that clip us round about,</LINE>
<LINE>Witness that here Iago doth give up</LINE>
<LINE>The execution of his wit, hands, heart,</LINE>
<LINE>To wrong&#8217;d Othello&#8217;s service! Let him command,</LINE>
<LINE>And to obey shall be in me remorse,</LINE>
<LINE>What bloody business ever.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>They rise.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">I greet thy love,</LINE>
<LINE>Not with vain thanks, but with acceptance bounteous,</LINE>
<LINE>And will upon the instant put thee to&#8217;t:</LINE>
<LINE>Within these three days let me hear thee say</LINE>
<LINE>That Cassio&#8217;s not alive.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My friend is dead; &#8217;tis done at your request.</LINE>
<LINE>But let her live.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Damn her, lewd minx! O, damn her, damn her!</LINE>
<LINE>Come go with me apart, I will withdraw</LINE>
<LINE>To furnish me with some swift means of death</LINE>
<LINE>For the fair devil. Now art thou my lieutenant.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am your own forever.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do you know, sirrah, where Lieutenant Cassio lies?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I dare not say he lies any where.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, man?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He&#8217;s a soldier, and for me to say a soldier lies, &#8217;tis stabbing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go to! Where lodges he?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To tell you where he lodges, is to tell you where I lie.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Can any thing be made of this?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know not where he lodges, and for me to devise a lodging and say he lies here, or he lies there, were to lie in mine own throat.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Can you inquire him out, and be edified by report?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will catechize the world for him, that is, make questions, and by them answer.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Seek him, bid him come hither. Tell him I have mov&#8217;d my lord on his behalf, and hope all will be well.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To do this is within the compass of man&#8217;s wit, and therefore I will attempt the doing it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit Clown.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Where should I lose the handkerchief, Emilia?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EMIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know not, madam.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Believe me, I had rather have lost my purse</LINE>
<LINE>Full of crusadoes; and but my noble Moor</LINE>
<LINE>Is true of mind, and made of no such baseness</LINE>
<LINE>As jealious creatures are, it were enough</LINE>
<LINE>To put him to ill thinking.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EMIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Is he not jealious?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who, he? I think the sun where he was born</LINE>
<LINE>Drew all such humors from him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EMIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">Look where he comes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Othello.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will not leave him now till Cassio</LINE>
<LINE>Be call&#8217;d to him.&#8212;How is&#8217;t with you, my lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, my good lady.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Aside.</STAGEDIR>

<LINE offset="4">O, hardness to dissemble!&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>How do you, Desdemona?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Well, my good lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Give me your hand. This hand is moist, my lady.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It yet hath felt no age nor known no sorrow.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This argues fruitfulness and liberal heart;</LINE>
<LINE>Hot, hot, and moist. This hand of yours requires</LINE>
<LINE>A sequester from liberty: fasting and prayer,</LINE>
<LINE>Much castigation, exercise devout,</LINE>
<LINE>For here&#8217;s a young and sweating devil here</LINE>
<LINE>That commonly rebels. &#8217;Tis a good hand,</LINE>
<LINE>A frank one.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="3">You may, indeed, say so;</LINE>
<LINE>For &#8217;twas that hand that gave away my heart.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A liberal hand. The hearts of old gave hands;</LINE>
<LINE>But our new heraldry is hands, not hearts.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I cannot speak of this. Come now, your promise.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What promise, chuck?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have a salt and sorry rheum offends me;</LINE>
<LINE>Lend me thy handkerchief.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Here, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That which I gave you.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not?</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="2">No, faith, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That&#8217;s a fault. That handkerchief</LINE>
<LINE>Did an Egyptian to my mother give;</LINE>
<LINE>She was a charmer, and could almost read</LINE>
<LINE>The thoughts of people. She told her, while she kept it,</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Twould make her amiable, and subdue my father</LINE>
<LINE>Entirely to her love; but if she lost it,</LINE>
<LINE>Or made a gift of it, my father&#8217;s eye</LINE>
<LINE>Should hold her loathed, and his spirits should hunt</LINE>
<LINE>After new fancies. She, dying, gave it me,</LINE>
<LINE>And bid me, when my fate would have me wiv&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>To give it her. I did so; and take heed on&#8217;t,</LINE>
<LINE>Make it a darling like your precious eye.</LINE>
<LINE>To lose&#8217;t or give&#8217;t away were such perdition</LINE>
<LINE>As nothing else could match.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">Is&#8217;t possible?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis true; there&#8217;s magic in the web of it.</LINE>
<LINE>A sibyl, that had numb&#8217;red in the world</LINE>
<LINE>The sun to course two hundred compasses,</LINE>
<LINE>In her prophetic fury sew&#8217;d the work;</LINE>
<LINE>The worms were hallowed that did breed the silk,</LINE>
<LINE>And it was dy&#8217;d in mummy which the skillful</LINE>
<LINE>Conserv&#8217;d of maidens&#8217; hearts.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">I&#8217; faith! Is&#8217;t true?</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Most veritable, therefore look to&#8217;t well.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Then would to God that I had never seen&#8217;t!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ha? Wherefore?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Say you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is not lost; but what and if it were?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Why, so I can, sir, but I will not now.</LINE>
<LINE>This is a trick to put me from my suit.</LINE>
<LINE>Pray you let Cassio be receiv&#8217;d again.</LINE>

<LINE>I nev&#8217;r saw this before.</LINE>
<LINE>Sure, there&#8217;s some wonder in this handkerchief;</LINE>
<LINE>I am most unhappy in the loss of it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EMIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis not a year or two shows us a man:</LINE>
<LINE>They are all but stomachs, and we all but food;</LINE>
<LINE>They eat us hungerly, and when they are full</LINE>
<LINE>They belch us.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Iago and Cassio.</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>And lo the happiness! Go, and importune her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How now, good Cassio, what&#8217;s the news with you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Madam, my former suit. I do beseech you</LINE>
<LINE>That by your virtuous means I may again</LINE>
<LINE>Exist, and be a member of his love</LINE>
<LINE>Whom I, with all the office of my heart,</LINE>
<LINE>Entirely honor. I would not be delay&#8217;d.</LINE>
<LINE>If my offense be of such mortal kind</LINE>
<LINE>That nor my service past, nor present sorrows,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor purpos&#8217;d merit in futurity,</LINE>
<LINE>Can ransom me into his love again,</LINE>
<LINE>But to know so must be my benefit;</LINE>
<LINE>So shall I clothe me in a forc&#8217;d content,</LINE>
<LINE>And shut myself up in some other course,</LINE>
<LINE>To fortune&#8217;s alms.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Alas, thrice-gentle Cassio,</LINE>
<LINE>My advocation is not now in tune.</LINE>
<LINE>My lord is not my lord; nor should I know him</LINE>
<LINE>Were he in favor as in humor alter&#8217;d.</LINE>
<LINE>So help me every spirit sanctified,</LINE>
<LINE>As I have spoken for you all my best,</LINE>
<LINE>And stood within the blank of his displeasure</LINE>
<LINE>For my free speech! You must awhile be patient.</LINE>
<LINE>What I can do, I will; and more I will</LINE>
<LINE>Than for myself I dare. Let that suffice you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is my lord angry?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EMIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">He went hence but now;</LINE>
<LINE>And certainly in strange unquietness.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Can he be angry? I have seen the cannon</LINE>
<LINE>When it hath blown his ranks into the air,</LINE>
<LINE>And like the devil from his very arm</LINE>
<LINE>Puff&#8217;d his own brother&#8212;and is he angry?</LINE>
<LINE>Something of moment then. I will go meet him.</LINE>
<LINE>There&#8217;s matter in&#8217;t indeed, if he be angry.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I prithee do so.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exit Iago.</STAGEDIR>

<LINE offset="3">Something sure of state,</LINE>
<LINE>Either from Venice, or some unhatch&#8217;d practice</LINE>
<LINE>Made demonstrable here in Cyprus to him,</LINE>
<LINE>Hath puddled his clear spirit; and in such cases</LINE>
<LINE>Men&#8217;s natures wrangle with inferior things,</LINE>
<LINE>Though great ones are their object. &#8217;Tis even so;</LINE>
<LINE>For let our finger ache, and it endues</LINE>
<LINE>Our other healthful members even to a sense</LINE>
<LINE>Of pain. Nay, we must think men are not gods,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor of them look for such observancy</LINE>
<LINE>As fits the bridal. Beshrew me much, Emilia,</LINE>
<LINE>I was (unhandsome warrior as I am)</LINE>
<LINE>Arraigning his unkindness with my soul;</LINE>
<LINE>But now I find I had suborn&#8217;d the witness,</LINE>
<LINE>And he&#8217;s indicted falsely.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EMIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pray heaven it be state matters, as you think,</LINE>
<LINE>And no conception nor no jealious toy</LINE>
<LINE>Concerning you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alas the day, I never gave him cause.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EMIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But jealious souls will not be answer&#8217;d so;</LINE>
<LINE>They are not ever jealious for the cause,</LINE>
<LINE>But jealious for they&#8217;re jealious. It is a monster</LINE>
<LINE>Begot upon itself, born on itself.</LINE>

<LINE offset="5">What make you from home?</LINE>
<LINE>How is&#8217;t with you, my most fair Bianca?</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;faith, sweet love, I was coming to your house.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And I was going to your lodging, Cassio.</LINE>
<LINE>What? Keep a week away? Seven days and nights?</LINE>
<LINE>Eightscore eight hours? And lovers&#8217; absent hours,</LINE>
<LINE>More tedious than the dial eightscore times?</LINE>
<LINE>O weary reck&#8217;ning!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Pardon me, Bianca.</LINE>
<LINE>I have this while with leaden thoughts been press&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>But I shall in a more continuate time</LINE>
<LINE>Strike off this score of absence. Sweet Bianca,</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Giving her Desdemona&#8217;s handkerchief.</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>Take me this work out.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">O Cassio, whence came this?</LINE>
<LINE>This is some token from a newer friend;</LINE>
<LINE>To the felt absence now I feel a cause.</LINE>
<LINE>Is&#8217;t come to this? Well, well.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">Go to, woman!</LINE>
<LINE>Throw your vild guesses in the devil&#8217;s teeth,</LINE>
<LINE>From whence you have them. You are jealious now</LINE>
<LINE>That this is from some mistress, some remembrance;</LINE>
<LINE>No, by my faith, Bianca.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Why, whose is it?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know not, neither; I found it in my chamber.</LINE>
<LINE>I like the work well; ere it be demanded</LINE>
<LINE>(As like enough it will) I would have it copied.</LINE>
<LINE>Take it, and do&#8217;t, and leave me for this time.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Leave you? Wherefore?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do attend here on the general,</LINE>
<LINE>And think it no addition, nor my wish,</LINE>
<LINE>To have him see me woman&#8217;d.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">Why, I pray you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not that I love you not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">But that you do not love me.</LINE>
<LINE>I pray you bring me on the way a little,</LINE>
<LINE>And say if I shall see you soon at night.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis but a little way that I can bring you,</LINE>
<LINE>For I attend here; but I&#8217;ll see you soon.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis very good; I must be circumstanc&#8217;d.</LINE>

<LINE>Or to be naked with her friend in bed</LINE>
<LINE>An hour, or more, not meaning any harm?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Naked in bed, Iago, and not mean harm?</LINE>
<LINE>It is hypocrisy against the devil.</LINE>

<LINE>What then?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>

<LINE>She is protectress of her honor too;</LINE>
<LINE>May she give that?</LINE>

<LINE>Her honor is an essence that&#8217;s not seen;</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<LINE>By heaven, I would most gladly have forgot it.</LINE>
<LINE>Thou saidst (O, it comes o&#8217;er my memory,</LINE>

<LINE>Ay; what of that?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">That&#8217;s not so good now.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="9">What</LINE>
<LINE>If I had said I had seen him do you wrong?</LINE>
<LINE>Or heard him say&#8212;as knaves be such abroad,</LINE>
<LINE>Who having by their own importunate suit,</LINE>
<LINE>Or voluntary dotage of some mistress,</LINE>
<LINE>Convinced or supplied them, cannot choose</LINE>
<LINE>But they must blab&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Lie with her? Lie on her? We say lie on her, when they belie her. Lie with her! &#8217;Zounds, that&#8217;s fulsome! Handkerchief&#8212;confessions&#8212;handkerchief! To confess, and be hang&#8217;d for his labor&#8212;first to be hang&#8217;d, and then to confess. I tremble at it. Nature would not invest herself in such shadowing passion without some instruction. It is not words that shakes me thus. Pish! Noses, ears, and lips. Is&#8217;t possible? Confess? Handkerchief? O devil!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Falls in a trance.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Work on,</LINE>
<LINE>My medicine, work! Thus credulous fools are caught,</LINE>

<LINE>My lord, I say! Othello!</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Cassio.</STAGEDIR>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What&#8217;s the matter?</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>My lord is fall&#8217;n into an epilepsy.</LINE>
<LINE>This is his second fit; he had one yesterday.</LINE>

<LINE>Rub him about the temples.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">No, forbear,</LINE>
<LINE>The lethargy must have his quiet course;</LINE>
<LINE>If not, he foams at mouth, and by and by</LINE>
<LINE>Breaks out to savage madness. Look, he stirs.</LINE>
<LINE>Do you withdraw yourself a little while,</LINE>
<LINE>He will recover straight. When he is gone,</LINE>
<LINE>I would on great occasion speak with you.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exit Cassio.</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>How is it, general? Have you not hurt your head?</LINE>

<LINE>Would you would bear your fortune like a man!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A horned man&#8217;s a monster and a beast.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There&#8217;s many a beast then in a populous city,</LINE>
<LINE>And many a civil monster.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Did he confess it?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Good sir, be a man;</LINE>
<LINE>Think every bearded fellow that&#8217;s but yok&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>May draw with you. There&#8217;s millions now alive</LINE>
<LINE>That nightly lie in those unproper beds</LINE>
<LINE>Which they dare swear peculiar; your case is better.</LINE>
<LINE>O, &#8217;tis the spite of hell, the fiend&#8217;s arch-mock,</LINE>
<LINE>To lip a wanton in a secure couch,</LINE>
<LINE>And to suppose her chaste! No, let me know,</LINE>
<LINE>And knowing what I am, I know what she shall be.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, thou art wise; &#8217;tis certain.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Stand you a while apart,</LINE>
<LINE>Confine yourself but in a patient list.</LINE>
<LINE>Whilst you were here o&#8217;erwhelmed with your grief</LINE>
<LINE>(A passion most unsuiting such a man),</LINE>
<LINE>Cassio came hither. I shifted him away,</LINE>
<LINE>And laid good &#8217;scuses upon your ecstasy;</LINE>
<LINE>Bade him anon return and here speak with me,</LINE>
<LINE>The which he promis&#8217;d. Do but encave yourself,</LINE>
<LINE>And mark the fleers, the gibes, and notable scorns</LINE>
<LINE>That dwell in every region of his face,</LINE>
<LINE>For I will make him tell the tale anew:</LINE>
<LINE>Where, how, how oft, how long ago, and when</LINE>
<LINE>He hath, and is again to cope your wife.</LINE>
<LINE>I say, but mark his gesture. Marry, patience,</LINE>
<LINE>Or I shall say y&#8217; are all in all in spleen,</LINE>
<LINE>And nothing of a man.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Dost thou hear, Iago,</LINE>
<LINE>I will be found most cunning in my patience;</LINE>
<LINE>But (dost thou hear) most bloody.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">That&#8217;s not amiss,</LINE>
<LINE>But yet keep time in all. Will you withdraw?</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Othello withdraws.</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>Now will I question Cassio of Bianca,</LINE>
<LINE>A huswife that by selling her desires</LINE>
<LINE>Buys herself bread and clothes. It is a creature</LINE>
<LINE>That dotes on Cassio (as &#8217;tis the strumpet&#8217;s plague</LINE>
<LINE>To beguile many and be beguil&#8217;d by one);</LINE>
<LINE>He, when he hears of her, cannot restrain</LINE>
<LINE>From the excess of laughter. Here he comes.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Cassio.</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>As he shall smile, Othello shall go mad;</LINE>
<LINE>And his unbookish jealousy must construe</LINE>
<LINE>Poor Cassio&#8217;s smiles, gestures, and light behaviors</LINE>
<LINE>Quite in the wrong. How do you now, lieutenant?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The worser that you give me the addition</LINE>
<LINE>Whose want even kills me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ply Desdemona well, and you are sure on&#8217;t.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Speaking lower.</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>Now, if this suit lay in Bianca&#8217;s pow&#8217;r,</LINE>
<LINE>How quickly should you speed!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">Alas, poor caitiff!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Look how he laughs already!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I never knew woman love man so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alas, poor rogue, I think, i&#8217; faith, she loves me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now he denies it faintly, and laughs it out.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do you hear, Cassio?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Now he importunes him</LINE>
<LINE>To tell it o&#8217;er. Go to, well said, well said.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She gives it out that you shall marry her.</LINE>
<LINE>Do you intend it?</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Ha, ha, ha!</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do you triumph, Roman? Do you triumph?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I marry her! What? A customer! Prithee bear some charity to my wit, do not think it so unwholesome. Ha, ha, ha!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So, so, so, so; they laugh that wins.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Faith, the cry goes that you marry her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Prithee say true.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am a very villain else.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Have you scor&#8217;d me? Well.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This is the monkey&#8217;s own giving out. She is persuaded I will marry her, out of her own love and flattery, not out of my promise.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Iago beckons me; now he begins the story.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She was here even now; she haunts me in every place. I was the other day talking on the sea-bank with certain Venetians, and thither comes the bauble, and by this hand, falls me thus about my neck&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Crying, &#8220;O dear Cassio!&#8221; as it were; his gesture imports it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So hangs, and lolls, and weeps upon me; so hales and pulls me. Ha, ha, ha!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now he tells how she pluck&#8217;d him to my chamber. O, I see that nose of yours, but not that dog I shall throw it to.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, I must leave her company.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Before me! Look where she comes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Bianca.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis such another fitchew! Marry, a perfum&#8217;d one!&#8212;What do you mean by this haunting of me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let the devil and his dam haunt you! What did you mean by that same handkerchief you gave me even now? I was a fine fool to take it. I must take out the work? A likely piece of work, that you should find it in your chamber, and know not who left it there! This is some minx&#8217;s token, and I must take out the work? There, give it your hobby-horse. Wheresoever you had it, I&#8217;ll take out no work on&#8217;t.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Good friend, go to him; for by this light of heaven,</LINE>

<LINE>If e&#8217;er my will did trespass &#8217;gainst his love,</LINE>
<LINE>Either in discourse of thought or actual deed,</LINE>
<LINE>Or that mine eyes, mine ears, or any sense</LINE>
<LINE>Delighted them in any other form;</LINE>
<LINE>Or that I do not yet, and ever did,</LINE>
<LINE>And ever will (though he do shake me off</LINE>
<LINE>To beggarly divorcement) love him dearly,</LINE>
<LINE>Comfort forswear me! Unkindness may do much,</LINE>
<LINE>And his unkindness may defeat my life,</LINE>

<LINE>It does abhor me now I speak the word;</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Every day thou daff&#8217;st me with some device, Iago, and rather, as it seems to me now, keep&#8217;st from me all conveniency than suppliest me with the least advantage of hope.

<LINE>Will you hear me, Roderigo?</LINE>

<LINE>Faith, I have heard too much; for your words and performances are no kin together.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You charge me most unjustly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>With nought but truth. I have wasted myself out of my means. The jewels you have had from me to deliver Desdemona would half have corrupted a votarist. You have told me she hath receiv&#8217;d them and return&#8217;d me expectations and comforts of sudden respect and acquaintance, but I find none.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, go to; very well.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Very well! Go to! I cannot go to, man, nor &#8217;tis not very well. By this hand, I think it is scurvy, and begin to find myself fopp&#8217;d in it.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Very well.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I tell you &#8217;tis not very well. I will make myself known to Desdemona. If she will return me my jewels, I will give over my suit and repent my unlawful solicitation; if not, assure yourself I will seek satisfaction of you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You have said now.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay; and said nothing but what I protest intendment of doing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, now I see there&#8217;s mettle in thee, and even from this instant do build on thee a better opinion than ever before. Give me thy hand, Roderigo. Thou hast taken against me a most just exception; but yet I protest I have dealt most directly in thy affair.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It hath not appear&#8217;d.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I grant indeed it hath not appear&#8217;d; and your suspicion is not without wit and judgment. But, Roderigo, if thou hast that in thee indeed, which I have greater reason to believe now than ever (I mean purpose, courage, and valor), this night show it. If thou the next night following enjoy not Desdemona, take me from this world with treachery and devise engines for my life.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well; what is it? Is it within reason and compass?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, there is especial commission come from Venice to depute Cassio in Othello&#8217;s place.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is that true? Why then Othello and Desdemona return again to Venice.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O no; he goes into Mauritania and taketh away with him the fair Desdemona, unless his abode be ling&#8217;red here by some accident; wherein none can be so determinate as the removing of Cassio.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How do you mean, removing him?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, by making him uncapable of Othello&#8217;s place: knocking out his brains.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And that you would have me to do?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay; if you dare do yourself a profit and a right. He sups tonight with a harlotry, and thither will I go to him&#8212;he knows not yet of his honorable fortune. If you will watch his going thence (which I will fashion to fall out between twelve and one), you may take him at your pleasure. I will be near to second your attempt, and he shall fall between us. Come, stand not amaz&#8217;d at it, but go along with me; I will show you such a necessity in his death that you shall think yourself bound to put it on him. It is now high supper-time, and the night grows to waste. About it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will hear further reason for this.</LINE>

<LINE>And pour our treasures into foreign laps;</LINE>
<LINE>Or else break out in peevish jealousies,</LINE>
<LINE>Throwing restraint upon us; or say they strike us,</LINE>
<LINE>Or scant our former having in despite:</LINE>
<LINE>Why, we have galls; and though we have some grace,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet have we some revenge. Let husbands know</LINE>
<LINE>Their wives have sense like them; they see, and smell,</LINE>
<LINE>And have their palates both for sweet and sour,</LINE>
<LINE>As husbands have. What is it that they do</LINE>
<LINE>When they change us for others? Is it sport?</LINE>
<LINE>I think it is. And doth affection breed it?</LINE>
<LINE>I think it doth. Is&#8217;t frailty that thus errs?</LINE>
<LINE>It is so too. And have not we affections,</LINE>
<LINE>Desires for sport, and frailty, as men have?</LINE>
<LINE>Then let them use us well; else let them know,</LINE>

<LINE>Yet she must die, else she&#8217;ll betray more men.</LINE>
<LINE>Put out the light, and then put out the light:</LINE>
<LINE>If I quench thee, thou flaming minister,</LINE>
<LINE>I can again thy former light restore,</LINE>
<LINE>Should I repent me; but once put out thy light,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou cunning&#8217;st pattern of excelling nature,</LINE>
<LINE>I know not where is that Promethean heat</LINE>
<LINE>That can thy light relume. When I have pluck&#8217;d thy rose,</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Kisses her.</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>Be thus when thou art dead, and I will kill thee</LINE>
<LINE>And love thee after. One more, and that&#8217;s the last.</LINE>
<LINE>So sweet was ne&#8217;er so fatal. I must weep,</LINE>

<LINE>You must forsake this room and go with us.</LINE>

<LINE>Nor set down aught in malice. Then must you speak</LINE>
<LINE>Of one that lov&#8217;d not wisely but too well;</LINE>
<LINE>Of one not easily jealious, but being wrought,</LINE>
<LINE>Perplexed in the extreme; of one whose hand</LINE>

<LINE>Albeit unused to the melting mood,</LINE>
