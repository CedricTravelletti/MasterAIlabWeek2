<stagedir>Enter Roderigo and Iago.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>ROD.</speaker>
<line>Tush, never tell me! I take it much unkindly</line>
<line>That thou, Iago, who hast had my purse</line>
<line>As if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line>&#8217;Sblood, but you&#8217;ll not hear me.</line>
<line>If ever I did dream of such a matter,</line>
<line>Abhor me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROD.</speaker>
<line>Thou toldst me thou didst hold him in thy hate.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line>Despise me if I do not. Three great ones of the city,</line>
<line>In personal suit to make me his lieutenant,</line>
<line>Off-capp&#8217;d to him; and, by the faith of man,</line>
<line>I know my price, I am worth no worse a place.</line>
<line>But he (as loving his own pride and purposes)</line>
<line>Evades them with a bumbast circumstance</line>
<line>Horribly stuff&#8217;d with epithites of war,</line>
<line>And in conclusion,</line>
<line>Nonsuits my mediators; for, &#8220;Certes,&#8221; says he,</line>
<line>&#8220;I have already chose my officer.&#8221;</line>
<line>And what was he?</line>
<line>Forsooth, a great arithmetician,</line>
<line>One Michael Cassio, a Florentine</line>
<line>(A fellow almost damn&#8217;d in a fair wife),</line>
<line>That never set a squadron in the field,</line>
<line>Nor the division of a battle knows</line>
<line>More than a spinster&#8212;unless the bookish theoric,</line>
<line>Wherein the toged consuls can propose</line>
<line>As masterly as he. Mere prattle, without practice,</line>
<line>Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had th&#8217; election;</line>
<line>And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof</line>
<line>At Rhodes, at Cyprus, and on other grounds</line>
<line>Christen&#8217;d and heathen, must be belee&#8217;d and calm&#8217;d</line>
<line>By debitor and creditor&#8212;this counter&#8212;caster,</line>
<line>He (in good time!) must his lieutenant be,</line>
<line>And I (God bless the mark!) his Moorship&#8217;s ancient.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROD.</speaker>
<line>By heaven, I rather would have been his hangman.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line>Why, there&#8217;s no remedy. &#8217;Tis the curse of service;</line>
<line>Preferment goes by letter and affection,</line>
<line>And not by old gradation, where each second</line>
<line>Stood heir to th&#8217; first. Now, sir, be judge yourself</line>
<line>Whether I in any just term am affin&#8217;d</line>
<line>To love the Moor.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROD.</speaker>
<line offset="4">I would not follow him then.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line>O, sir, content you;</line>
<line>I follow him to serve my turn upon him.</line>
<line>We cannot all be masters, nor all masters</line>
<line>Cannot be truly follow&#8217;d. You shall mark</line>
<line>Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave</line>
<line>That (doting on his own obsequious bondage)</line>
<line>Wears out his time, much like his master&#8217;s ass,</line>
<line>For nought but provender, and when he&#8217;s old, cashier&#8217;d.</line>
<line>Whip me such honest knaves. Others there are</line>
<line>Who, trimm&#8217;d in forms and visages of duty,</line>
<line>Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves,</line>
<line>And throwing but shows of service on their lords,</line>
<line>Do well thrive by them; and when they have lin&#8217;d their coats,</line>
<line>Do themselves homage. These fellows have some soul,</line>
<line>And such a one do I profess myself. For, sir,</line>
<line>It is as sure as you are Roderigo,</line>
<line>Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago.</line>
<line>In following him, I follow but myself;</line>
<line>Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,</line>
<line>But seeming so, for my peculiar end;</line>
<line>For when my outward action doth demonstrate</line>
<line>The native act and figure of my heart</line>
<line>In complement extern, &#8217;tis not long after</line>
<line>But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve</line>
<line>For daws to peck at: I am not what I am.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROD.</speaker>
<line>What a full fortune does the thick-lips owe</line>
<line>If he can carry&#8217;t thus!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Call up her father.</line>
<line>Rouse him, make after him, poison his delight,</line>
<line>Proclaim him in the streets; incense her kinsmen,</line>
<line>And though he in a fertile climate dwell,</line>
<line>Plague him with flies. Though that his joy be joy,</line>
<line>Yet throw such changes of vexation on&#8217;t,</line>
<line>As it may lose some color.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROD.</speaker>
<line>Here is her father&#8217;s house, I&#8217;ll call aloud.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line>Do, with like timorous accent and dire yell</line>
<line>As when, by night and negligence, the fire</line>
<line>Is spied in populous cities.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROD.</speaker>
<line>What ho! Brabantio, Signior Brabantio, ho!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line>Awake! What ho, Brabantio! Thieves, thieves!</line>
<line>Look to your house, your daughter, and your bags!</line>
<line>Thieves, thieves!</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Brabantio above at a window.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>BRA.</speaker>
<line>What is the reason of this terrible summons?</line>
<line>What is the matter there?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROD.</speaker>
<line>Signior, is all your family within?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line>Are your doors lock&#8217;d?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BRA.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Why? Wherefore ask you this?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line>&#8217;Zounds, sir, y&#8217; are robb&#8217;d! For shame, put on your gown;</line>
<line>Your heart is burst, you have lost half your soul;</line>
<line>Even now, now, very now, an old black ram</line>
<line>Is tupping your white ewe. Arise, arise!</line>
<line>Awake the snorting citizens with the bell,</line>
<line>Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you.</line>
<line>Arise, I say!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BRA.</speaker>
<line offset="3">What, have you lost your wits?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROD.</speaker>
<line>Most reverend signior, do you know my voice?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BRA.</speaker>
<line>Not I; what are you?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROD.</speaker>
<line>My name is Roderigo.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BRA.</speaker>
<line offset="4">The worser welcome;</line>
<line>I have charg&#8217;d thee not to haunt about my doors.</line>
<line>In honest plainness thou hast heard me say</line>
<line>My daughter is not for thee; and now, in madness</line>
<line>(Being full of supper and distemp&#8217;ring draughts),</line>
<line>Upon malicious bravery dost thou come</line>
<line>To start my quiet.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROD.</speaker>
<line>Sir, sir, sir&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BRA.</speaker>
<line offset="3">But thou must needs be sure</line>
<line>My spirits and my place have in their power</line>
<line>To make this bitter to thee.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROD.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Patience, good sir.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BRA.</speaker>
<line>What tell&#8217;st thou me of robbing? This is Venice;</line>
<line>My house is not a grange.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROD.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Most grave Brabantio,</line>
<line>In simple and pure soul I come to you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line>&#8217;Zounds, sir, you are one of those that will not serve God, if the devil bid you. Because we come to do you service, and you think we are ruffians, You&#8217;ll have your daughter cover&#8217;d with a Barbary horse, You&#8217;ll have your nephews neigh to you; You&#8217;ll have coursers for cousins, and gennets for germans.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BRA.</speaker>
<line>What profane wretch art thou?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line>I am one, sir, that comes to tell you your daughter and the Moor are now making the beast with two backs.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BRA.</speaker>
<line>Thou art a villain.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line offset="4">You are a senator.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BRA.</speaker>
<line>This thou shalt answer; I know thee, Roderigo.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROD.</speaker>
<line>Sir, I will answer any thing. But I beseech you,</line>
<line>If&#8217;t be your pleasure and most wise consent</line>
<line>(As partly I find it is) that your fair daughter,</line>
<line>At this odd-even and dull watch o&#8217; th&#8217; night,</line>
<line>Transported with no worse nor better guard</line>
<line>But with a knave of common hire, a gundolier,</line>
<line>To the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor&#8212;</line>
<line>If this be known to you, and your allowance,</line>
<line>We then have done you bold and saucy wrongs;</line>
<line>But if you know not this, my manners tell me</line>
<line>We have your wrong rebuke. Do not believe</line>
<line>That, from the sense of all civility,</line>
<line>I thus would play and trifle with your reverence.</line>
<line>Your daughter (if you have not given her leave),</line>
<line>I say again, hath made a gross revolt,</line>
<line>Tying her duty, beauty, wit, and fortunes</line>
<line>In an extravagant and wheeling stranger</line>
<line>Of here and every where. Straight satisfy yourself.</line>
<line>If she be in her chamber or your house,</line>
<line>Let loose on me the justice of the state</line>
<line>For thus deluding you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BRA.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Strike on the tinder, ho!</line>
<line>Give me a taper! Call up all my people!</line>
<line>This accident is not unlike my dream,</line>
<line>Belief of it oppresses me already.</line>
<line>Light, I say, light!</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit above.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Farewell; for I must leave you.</line>
<line>It seems not meet, nor wholesome to my place,</line>
<line>To be producted (as, if I stay, I shall)</line>
<line>Against the Moor; for I do know the state</line>
<line>(How ever this may gall him with some check)</line>
<line>Cannot with safety cast him, for he&#8217;s embark&#8217;d</line>
<line>With such loud reason to the Cyprus wars</line>
<line>(Which even now stands in act) that, for their souls,</line>
<line>Another of his fathom they have none</line>
<line>To lead their business; in which regard,</line>
<line>Though I do hate him as I do hell-pains,</line>
<line>Yet, for necessity of present life,</line>
<line>I must show out a flag and sign of love,</line>
<line>Which is indeed but sign. That you shall surely find him,</line>
<line>Lead to the Sagittary the raised search;</line>
<line>And there will I be with him. So farewell.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit.</stagedir>

<stagedir>Enter below Brabantio in his night-gown with Servants and torches.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>BRA.</speaker>
<line>It is too true an evil; gone she is;</line>
<line>And what&#8217;s to come of my despised time</line>
<line>Is nought but bitterness. Now, Roderigo,</line>
<line>Where didst thou see her?&#8212;O unhappy girl!&#8212;</line>
<line>With the Moor, say&#8217;st thou?&#8212;Who would be a father!&#8212;</line>
<line>How didst thou know &#8217;twas she?&#8212;O, she deceives me</line>
<line>Past thought!&#8212;What said she to you?&#8212;Get more tapers;</line>
<line>Raise all my kindred.&#8212;Are they married, think you?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROD.</speaker>
<line>Truly, I think they are.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BRA.</speaker>
<line>O heaven! How got she out? O treason of the blood!</line>
<line>Fathers, from hence trust not your daughters&#8217; minds</line>
<line>By what you see them act. Is there not charms</line>
<line>By which the property of youth and maidhood</line>
<line>May be abus&#8217;d? Have you not read, Roderigo,</line>
<line>Of some such thing?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROD.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Yes, sir, I have indeed.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BRA.</speaker>
<line>Call up my brother.&#8212;O would you had had her!&#8212;</line>
<line>Some one way, some another.&#8212;Do you know</line>
<line>Where we may apprehend her and the Moor?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROD.</speaker>
<line>I think I can discover him, if you please</line>
<line>To get good guard and go along with me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BRA.</speaker>
<line>Pray you lead on. At every house I&#8217;ll call</line>
<line>(I may command at most).&#8212;Get weapons, ho!</line>
<line>And raise some special officers of night.&#8212;</line>
<line>On, good Roderigo, I will deserve your pains.</line>

<stagedir>Enter Othello, Iago, Attendants with torches.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line>Though in the trade of war I have slain men,</line>
<line>Yet do I hold it very stuff o&#8217; th&#8217; conscience</line>
<line>To do no contriv&#8217;d murder. I lack iniquity</line>
<line>Sometime to do me service. Nine or ten times</line>
<line>I had thought t&#8217; have yerk&#8217;d him here under the ribs.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OTH.</speaker>
<line>&#8217;Tis better as it is.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Nay, but he prated,</line>
<line>And spoke such scurvy and provoking terms</line>
<line>Against your honor,</line>
<line>That with the little godliness I have</line>
<line>I did full hard forbear him. But I pray you, sir,</line>
<line>Are you fast married? Be assur&#8217;d of this,</line>
<line>That the magnifico is much belov&#8217;d,</line>
<line>And hath in his effect a voice potential</line>
<line>As double as the Duke&#8217;s. He will divorce you,</line>
<line>Or put upon you what restraint or grievance</line>
<line>The law (with all his might to enforce it on)</line>
<line>Will give him cable.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OTH.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Let him do his spite;</line>
<line>My services which I have done the signiory</line>

<line>I shall provulgate&#8212;I fetch my life and being</line>
<line>From men of royal siege, and my demerits</line>
<line>May speak, unbonneted, to as proud a fortune</line>
<line>As this that I have reach&#8217;d; for know, Iago,</line>
<line>But that I love the gentle Desdemona,</line>
<line>I would not my unhoused free condition</line>
<line>Put into circumscription and confine</line>
<line>For the sea&#8217;s worth. But look, what lights come yond?</line>

<line>Something from Cyprus, as I may divine;</line>

<line>O thou foul thief, where hast thou stow&#8217;d my daughter?</line>
<line>Damn&#8217;d as thou art, thou hast enchanted her,</line>
<line>For I&#8217;ll refer me to all things of sense,</line>
<line>If she in chains of magic were not bound,</line>
<line>Whether a maid so tender, fair, and happy,</line>
<line>So opposite to marriage that she shunn&#8217;d</line>
<line>The wealthy curled darlings of our nation,</line>
<line>Would ever have, t&#8217; incur a general mock,</line>
<line>Run from her guardage to the sooty bosom</line>
<line>Of such a thing as thou&#8212;to fear, not to delight!</line>
<line>Judge me the world, if &#8217;tis not gross in sense,</line>
<line>That thou hast practic&#8217;d on her with foul charms,</line>
<line>Abus&#8217;d her delicate youth with drugs or minerals</line>
<line>That weakens motion. I&#8217;ll have&#8217;t disputed on,</line>
<line>&#8217;Tis probable, and palpable to thinking.</line>
<line>I therefore apprehend and do attach thee</line>

<line>I ran it through, even from my boyish days</line>
<line>To th&#8217; very moment that he bade me tell it;</line>
<line>Wherein I spoke of most disastrous chances:</line>
<line>Of moving accidents by flood and field,</line>
<line>Of hair-breadth scapes i&#8217; th&#8217; imminent deadly breach,</line>
<line>Of being taken by the insolent foe</line>

<line>To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart</line>
<line>That I would all my pilgrimage dilate,</line>
<line>Whereof by parcels she had something heard,</line>
<line>But not intentively. I did consent,</line>

If the beam of our lives had not one scale of reason to poise another of sensuality, the blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us to most prepost&#8217;rous conclusions.

It cannot be long that Desdemona should continue her love to the Moor&#8212;put money in thy purse&#8212;nor he his to her. It was a violent commencement in her, and thou shalt see an answerable sequestration&#8212;put but money in thy purse. These Moors are changeable in their wills&#8212;fill thy purse with money. The food that to him now is as luscious as locusts, shall be to him shortly as acerb as the coloquintida. She must change for youth; when she is sated with his body, she will find the error of her choice. She must have change, she must; therefore put money in thy purse. If thou wilt needs damn thyself, do it a more delicate way than drowning. Make all the money thou canst. If sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian and a super-subtle Venetian be not too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell, thou shalt enjoy her; therefore make money. A pox of drowning thyself, it is clean out of the way. Seek thou rather to be hang&#8217;d in compassing thy joy than to be drown&#8217;d and go without her.</line>

<line>Thou art sure of me&#8212;go make money. I have told thee often, and I retell thee again and again, I hate the Moor. My cause is hearted; thine hath no less reason. Let us be conjunctive in our revenge against him. If thou canst cuckold him, thou dost thyself a pleasure, me a sport. There are many events in the womb of time which will be deliver&#8217;d. Traverse, go, provide thy money. We will have more of this tomorrow. <french xml:lang="fr">Adieu</french>.</line>

<line>Will do as if for surety. He holds me well,</line>
<line>The better shall my purpose work on him.</line>
<line>Cassio&#8217;s a proper man. Let me see now:</line>

<line>In double knavery&#8212;How? How?&#8212;Let&#8217;s see&#8212;</line>
<line>After some time, to abuse Othello&#8217;s ear</line>
<line>That he is too familiar with his wife.</line>
<line>He hath a person and a smooth dispose</line>
<line>To be suspected&#8212;fram&#8217;d to make women false.</line>
<line>The Moor is of a free and open nature,</line>

<line>And will as tenderly be led by th&#8217; nose</line>
<line>As asses are.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line>I am about it, but indeed my invention</line>
<line>Comes from my pate as birdlime does from frieze,</line>
<line>It plucks out brains and all. But my Muse labors,</line>

<line>She never yet was foolish that was fair,</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DES.</speaker>
<line>These are old fond paradoxes to make fools laugh i&#8217; th&#8217; alehouse. What miserable praise hast thou for her that&#8217;s foul and foolish?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line>There&#8217;s none so foul and foolish thereunto,</line>
<line>But does foul pranks which fair and wise ones do.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DES.</speaker>
<line>O heavy ignorance! Thou praisest the worst best. But what praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving woman indeed&#8212;one that in the authority of her merit, did justly put on the vouch of very malice itself?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line>She that was ever fair, and never proud,</line>
<line>Had tongue at will, and yet was never loud,</line>
<line>Never lack&#8217;d gold, and yet went never gay,</line>
<line>Fled from her wish, and yet said, &#8220;Now I may&#8221;;</line>
<line>She that being ang&#8217;red, her revenge being nigh,</line>
<line>Bade her wrong stay, and her displeasure fly;</line>
<line>She that in wisdom never was so frail</line>
<line>To change the cod&#8217;s head for the salmon&#8217;s tail;</line>
<line>She that could think, and nev&#8217;r disclose her mind,</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line>To suckle fools and chronicle small beer.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DES.</speaker>
<line>O most lame and impotent conclusion! Do not learn of him, Emilia, though he be thy husband. How say you, Cassio? Is he not a most profane and liberal counsellor?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CAS.</speaker>
<line>He speaks home, madam. You may relish him more in the soldier than in the scholar.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker> <stagedir>Aside.</stagedir> 
<line>He takes her by the palm; ay, well said, whisper. With as little a web as this will I ensnare as great a fly as Cassio. Ay, smile upon her, do; I will gyve thee in thine own courtship. You say true, &#8217;tis so indeed. If such tricks as these strip you out of your lieutenantry, it had been better you had not kiss&#8217;d your three fingers so oft, which now again you are most apt to play the sir in. Very good; well kiss&#8217;d! An excellent courtesy! &#8217;Tis so indeed. Yet again, your fingers to your lips? Would they were clyster-pipes for your sake!</line>

<line>It gives me wonder great as my content</line>

<line>And let the laboring bark climb hills of seas</line>

<line>How does my old acquaintance of this isle?</line>
<line>Honey, you shall be well desir&#8217;d in Cyprus,</line>
<line>I have found great love amongst them. O my sweet,</line>
<line>I prattle out of fashion, and I dote</line>
<line>In mine own comforts. I prithee, good Iago,</line>
<line>Go to the bay and disembark my coffers.</line>
<line>Bring thou the master to the citadel;</line>
<line>He is a good one, and his worthiness</line>
<line>Does challenge much respect. Come, Desdemona,</line>
<line>Once more, well met at Cyprus.</line>

<stagedir>Exeunt Othello and Desdemona with all but Iago and Roderigo.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker> <stagedir>To an Attendant, as he is going out.</stagedir> <line>Do thou meet me presently at the harbor.&#8212;Come hither. If thou be&#8217;st valiant (as they say base men being in love have then a nobility in their natures more than is native to them), list me. The lieutenant tonight watches on the court of guard. First, I must tell thee this: Desdemona is directly in love with him.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>ROD.</speaker>
<line>With him? Why, &#8217;tis not possible.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line>Lay thy finger thus; and let thy soul be instructed. Mark me with what violence she first lov&#8217;d the Moor, but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies. To love him still for prating&#8212;let not thy discreet heart think it. Her eye must be fed; and what delight shall she have to look on the devil? When the blood is made dull with the act of sport, there should be, again to inflame it and to give satiety a fresh appetite, loveliness in favor, sympathy in years, manners, and beauties&#8212;all which the Moor is defective in. Now for want of these requir&#8217;d conveniences, her delicate tenderness will find itself abus&#8217;d, begin to heave the gorge, disrelish and abhor the Moor; very nature will instruct her in it and compel her to some second choice. Now, sir, this granted (as it is a most pregnant and unforc&#8217;d position), who stands so eminent in the degree of this fortune as Cassio does? A knave very voluble; no further conscionable than in putting on the mere form of civil and humane seeming, for the better compass of his salt and most hidden loose affection? Why, none, why, none&#8212;a slipper and subtle knave, a finder-out of occasion; that has an eye can stamp and counterfeit advantages, though true advantage never present itself; a devilish knave. Besides, the knave is handsome, young, and hath all those requisites in him that folly and green minds look after; a pestilent complete knave, and the woman hath found him already.</line>

<line>Lechery, by this hand; an index and obscure prologue to the history of lust and foul thoughts. They met so near with their lips that their breaths embrac&#8217;d together. Villainous thoughts, Roderigo! When these mutualities so marshal the way, hard at hand comes the master and main exercise, th&#8217; incorporate conclusion. Pish! But, sir, be you rul&#8217;d by me. I have brought you from Venice. Watch you tonight; for the command, I&#8217;ll lay&#8217;t upon you. Cassio knows you not. I&#8217;ll not be far from you. Do you find some occasion to anger Cassio, either by speaking too loud, or tainting his discipline, or from what other course you please, which the time shall more favorably minister.</line>

<line>Sir, he&#8217;s rash and very sudden in choler, and happily may strike at you&#8212;provoke him that he may; for even out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to mutiny, whose qualification shall come into no true taste again but by the displanting of Cassio. So shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by the means I shall then have to prefer them; and the impediment most profitably remov&#8217;d, without the which there were no expectation of our prosperity.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line>As I am an honest man, I had thought you had receiv&#8217;d some bodily wound; there is more sense in that than in reputation. Reputation is an idle and most false imposition; oft got without merit, and lost without deserving. You have lost no reputation at all, unless you repute yourself such a loser. What, man, there are more ways to recover the general again. You are but now cast in his mood, a punishment more in policy than in malice, even so as one would beat his offenseless dog to affright an imperious lion. Sue to him again, and he&#8217;s yours.</line>
</speech>

<line>I will rather sue to be despis&#8217;d than to deceive so good a commander with so slight, so drunken, and so indiscreet an officer. Drunk? And speak parrot? And squabble? Swagger? Swear?

<line>I will ask him for my place again, he shall tell me I am a drunkard! Had I as many mouths as Hydra, such an answer would stop them all. To be now a sensible man, by and by a fool, and presently a beast! O strange! Every inordinate cup is unbless&#8217;d, and the ingredient is a devil.</line>

<line>You, or any man living, may be drunk at a time, man. I&#8217;ll tell you what you shall do. Our general&#8217;s wife is now the general&#8212;I may say so in this respect, for that he hath devoted and given up himself to the contemplation, mark, and denotement of her parts and graces. Confess yourself freely to her; importune her help to put you in your place again. She is of so free, so kind, so apt, so bless&#8217;d a disposition, she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more than she is requested. This broken joint between you and her husband entreat her to splinter; and my fortunes against any lay worth naming, this crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before.</line>

<line>And what&#8217;s he then that says I play the villain,</line>
<line>When this advice is free I give, and honest,</line>
<line>Probal to thinking, and indeed the course</line>
<line>To win the Moor again? For &#8217;tis most easy</line>
<line>Th&#8217; inclining Desdemona to subdue</line>
<line>In any honest suit; she&#8217;s fram&#8217;d as fruitful</line>
<line>As the free elements. And then for her</line>
<line>To win the Moor, were&#8217;t to renounce his baptism,</line>
<line>All seals and symbols of redeemed sin,</line>
<line>His soul is so enfetter&#8217;d to her love,</line>
<line>That she may make, unmake, do what she list,</line>
<line>Even as her appetite shall play the god</line>
<line>With his weak function. How am I then a villain,</line>
<line>To counsel Cassio to this parallel course,</line>
<line>Directly to his good? Divinity of hell!</line>
<line>When devils will the blackest sins put on,</line>
<line>They do suggest at first with heavenly shows,</line>
<line>As I do now; for whiles this honest fool</line>
<line>Plies Desdemona to repair his fortune,</line>
<line>And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor,</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll pour this pestilence into his ear&#8212;</line>
<line>That she repeals him for her body&#8217;s lust,</line>
<line>And by how much she strives to do him good,</line>
<line>She shall undo her credit with the Moor.</line>
<line>So will I turn her virtue into pitch,</line>
<line>And out of her own goodness make the net</line>
<line>That shall enmesh them all.</line>

<line>How now, Roderigo?</line>

<line>I do follow here in the chase, not like a hound that hunts, but one that fills up the cry. My money is almost spent; I have been tonight exceedingly well cudgell&#8217;d; and I think the issue will be, I shall have so much experience for my pains; and so, with no money at all and a little more wit, return again to Venice.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line>How poor are they that have not patience!</line>
<line>What wound did ever heal but by degrees?</line>
<line>Thou know&#8217;st we work by wit, and not by witchcraft,</line>
<line>And wit depends on dilatory time.</line>
<line>Does&#8217;t not go well? Cassio hath beaten thee,</line>
<line>And thou by that small hurt hast cashier&#8217;d Cassio.</line>
<line>Though other things grow fair against the sun,</line>
<line>Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe.</line>
<line>Content thyself a while. By the mass, &#8217;tis morning;</line>
<line>Pleasure and action make the hours seem short.</line>

<line offset="4">Think, my lord?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OTH.</speaker>
<line>Think, my lord? By heaven, thou echo&#8217;st me,</line>
<line>As if there were some monster in thy thought</line>
<line>Too hideous to be shown. Thou dost mean something.</line>
<line>I heard thee say even now, thou lik&#8217;st not that,</line>
<line>When Cassio left my wife. What didst not like?</line>
<line>And when I told thee he was of my counsel</line>
<line>In my whole course of wooing, thou criedst, &#8220;Indeed!&#8221;</line>
<line>And didst contract and purse thy brow together,</line>
<line>As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain</line>
<line>Some horrible conceit. If thou dost love me,</line>
<line>Show me thy thought.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line>My lord, you know I love you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OTH.</speaker>
<line offset="7">I think thou dost;</line>
<line>And for I know thou&#8217;rt full of love and honesty,</line>
<line>And weigh&#8217;st thy words before thou giv&#8217;st them breath,</line>
<line>Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more;</line>
<line>For such things in a false disloyal knave</line>
<line>Are tricks of custom; but in a man that&#8217;s just</line>
<line>They&#8217;re close dilations, working from the heart,</line>
<line>That passion cannot rule.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line offset="5">For Michael Cassio,</line>
<line>I dare be sworn I think that he is honest.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OTH.</speaker>
<line>I think so too.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line offset="3">Men should be what they seem,</line>
<line>Or those that be not, would they might seem none!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OTH.</speaker>
<line>Certain, men should be what they seem.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line>Why then I think Cassio&#8217;s an honest man.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OTH.</speaker>
<line>Nay, yet there&#8217;s more in this.</line>
<line>I prithee speak to me as to thy thinkings,</line>
<line>As thou dost ruminate, and give thy worst of thoughts</line>
<line>The worst of words.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Good my lord, pardon me:</line>
<line>Though I am bound to every act of duty,</line>
<line>I am not bound to that all slaves are free to.</line>
<line>Utter my thoughts? Why, say they are vild and false,</line>
<line>As where&#8217;s that palace whereinto foul things</line>
<line>Sometimes intrude not? Who has that breast so pure</line>
<line>But some uncleanly apprehensions</line>
<line>Keep leets and law-days and in sessions sit</line>
<line>With meditations lawful?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OTH.</speaker>
<line>Thou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago,</line>
<line>If thou but think&#8217;st him wrong&#8217;d, and mak&#8217;st his ear</line>
<line>A stranger to thy thoughts.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line offset="5">I do beseech you,</line>
<line>Though I perchance am vicious in my guess</line>
<line>(As I confess it is my nature&#8217;s plague</line>
<line>To spy into abuses, and oft my jealousy</line>
<line>Shapes faults that are not), that your wisdom then,</line>
<line>From one that so imperfectly conjects,</line>
<line>Would take no notice, nor build yourself a trouble</line>
<line>Out of his scattering and unsure observance.</line>
<line>It were not for your quiet nor your good,</line>
<line>Nor for my manhood, honesty, and wisdom,</line>
<line>To let you know my thoughts.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OTH.</speaker>
<line>&#8217;Zounds, what dost thou mean?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line>Good name in man and woman, dear my lord,</line>
<line>Is the immediate jewel of their souls.</line>
<line>Who steals my purse steals trash; &#8217;tis something, nothing;</line>
<line>&#8217;Twas mine, &#8217;tis his, and has been slave to thousands;</line>
<line>But he that filches from me my good name</line>
<line>Robs me of that which not enriches him,</line>
<line>And makes me poor indeed.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OTH.</speaker>
<line>By heaven, I&#8217;ll know thy thoughts.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line>You cannot, if my heart were in your hand,</line>
<line>Nor shall not, whilst &#8217;tis in my custody.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OTH.</speaker>
<line>Ha?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line offset="2">O, beware, my lord, of jealousy!</line>
<line>It is the green-ey&#8217;d monster which doth mock</line>
<line>The meat it feeds on. That cuckold lives in bliss</line>
<line>Who, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger;</line>
<line>But O, what damned minutes tells he o&#8217;er</line>
<line>Who dotes, yet doubts; suspects, yet strongly loves!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OTH.</speaker>
<line>O misery!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line>Poor and content is rich, and rich enough,</line>
<line>But riches fineless is as poor as winter</line>
<line>To him that ever fears he shall be poor.</line>
<line>Good God, the souls of all my tribe defend</line>
<line>From jealousy!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OTH.</speaker>
<line offset="3">Why? Why is this?</line>
<line>Think&#8217;st thou I&#8217;d make a life of jealousy?</line>
<line>To follow still the changes of the moon</line>
<line>With fresh suspicions? No! To be once in doubt</line>
<line>Is once to be resolv&#8217;d. Exchange me for a goat,</line>
<line>When I shall turn the business of my soul</line>
<line>To such exsufflicate and blown surmises,</line>
<line>Matching thy inference. &#8217;Tis not to make me jealous</line>
<line>To say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company,</line>
<line>Is free of speech, sings, plays, and dances well;</line>
<line>Where virtue is, these are more virtuous.</line>
<line>Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw</line>
<line>The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt,</line>
<line>For she had eyes, and chose me. No, Iago,</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll see before I doubt; when I doubt, prove;</line>
<line>And on the proof, there is no more but this&#8212;</line>
<line>Away at once with love or jealousy!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line>I am glad of this, for now I shall have reason</line>
<line>To show the love and duty that I bear you</line>
<line>With franker spirit; therefore (as I am bound)</line>
<line>Receive it from me. I speak not yet of proof.</line>
<line>Look to your wife, observe her well with Cassio,</line>
<line>Wear your eyes thus, not jealious nor secure.</line>
<line>I would not have your free and noble nature,</line>
<line>Out of self-bounty, be abus&#8217;d; look to&#8217;t.</line>
<line>I know our country disposition well:</line>
<line>In Venice they do let God see the pranks</line>
<line>They dare not show their husbands; their best conscience</line>
<line>Is not to leave&#8217;t undone, but keep&#8217;t unknown.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OTH.</speaker>
<line>Dost thou say so?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line>She did deceive her father, marrying you,</line>
<line>And when she seem&#8217;d to shake and fear your looks,</line>
<line>She lov&#8217;d them most.</line>

<line>She that so young could give out such a seeming</line>
<line>To seel her father&#8217;s eyes up, close as oak,</line>
<line>He thought &#8217;twas witchcraft&#8212;but I am much to blame;</line>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line offset="5">I&#8217; faith, I fear it has.</line>

<line>And yet how nature erring from itself&#8212;</line>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line>Ay, there&#8217;s the point; as (to be bold with you)</line>
<line>Not to affect many proposed matches</line>
<line>Of her own clime, complexion, and degree,</line>
<line>Whereto we see in all things nature tends&#8212;</line>
<line>Foh, one may smell in such, a will most rank,</line>
<line>Foul disproportions, thoughts unnatural.</line>
<line>But (pardon me) I do not in position</line>
<line>Distinctly speak of her, though I may fear</line>
<line>Her will, recoiling to her better judgment,</line>

<line>Yet if you please to hold him off awhile,</line>
<line>You shall by that perceive him and his means.</line>
<line>Note if your lady strain his entertainment</line>
<line>With any strong or vehement importunity;</line>
<line>Much will be seen in that. In the mean time,</line>
<line>Let me be thought too busy in my fears</line>
<line>(As worthy cause I have to fear I am)</line>

<line>This fellow&#8217;s of exceeding honesty,</line>

<line>Of human dealings. If I do prove her haggard,</line>
<line>Though that her jesses were my dear heart-strings,</line>
<line>I&#8217;ld whistle her off, and let her down the wind</line>
<line>To prey at fortune. Haply, for I am black,</line>
<line>And have not those soft parts of conversation</line>
<line>That chamberers have, or for I am declin&#8217;d</line>
<line>Into the vale of years (yet that&#8217;s not much),</line>
<line>She&#8217;s gone. I am abus&#8217;d, and my relief</line>
<line>Must be to loathe her. O curse of marriage!</line>
<line>That we can call these delicate creatures ours,</line>
<line>And not their appetites! I had rather be a toad</line>
<line>And live upon the vapor of a dungeon</line>
<line>Than keep a corner in the thing I love</line>
<line>For others&#8217; uses. Yet &#8217;tis the plague of great ones,</line>
<line>Prerogativ&#8217;d are they less than the base;</line>
<line>&#8217;Tis destiny unshunnable, like death.</line>
<line>Even then this forked plague is fated to us</line>

<line>I am glad I have found this napkin;</line>
<line>This was her first remembrance from the Moor.</line>
<line>My wayward husband hath a hundred times</line>
<line>Woo&#8217;d me to steal it; but she so loves the token</line>
<line>(For he conjur&#8217;d her she should ever keep it)</line>
<line>That she reserves it evermore about her</line>
<line>To kiss and talk to. I&#8217;ll have the work ta&#8217;en out,</line>
<line>And give&#8217;t Iago. What he will do with it</line>
<line>Heaven knows, not I;</line>
<line>I nothing but to please his fantasy.</line>

<stagedir>Enter Iago.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line>How now? What do you here alone?</line>

<line>To have a foolish wife.</line>

<line>O, is that all? What will you give me now</line>
<line>For that same handkerchief?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line offset="5">What handkerchief?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>EMIL.</speaker>
<line>What handkerchief?</line>
<line>Why, that the Moor first gave to Desdemona,</line>
<line>That which so often you did bid me steal.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line>Hast stol&#8217;n it from her?</line>

<speech>
<speaker>EMIL.</speaker>
<line>No, faith; she let it drop by negligence,</line>

<line>Go, leave me.</line>

<stagedir>Exit Emilia.</stagedir>

<line>I will in Cassio&#8217;s lodging lose this napkin,</line>
<line>And let him find it. Trifles light as air</line>
<line>Are to the jealious confirmations strong</line>
<line>As proofs of holy writ; this may do something.</line>
<line>The Moor already changes with my poison:</line>
<line>Dangerous conceits are in their natures poisons,</line>
<line>Which at the first are scarce found to distaste,</line>
<line>But with a little act upon the blood</line>
<line>Burn like the mines of sulphur.</line>

<stagedir>Enter Othello.</stagedir>

<line offset="7">I did say so.</line>
<line>Look where he comes! Not poppy, nor mandragora,</line>

<line>Were they as prime as goats, as hot as monkeys,</line>
<line>As salt as wolves in pride, and fools as gross</line>
<line>As ignorance made drunk. But yet, I say,</line>
<line>If imputation and strong circumstances</line>
<line>Which lead directly to the door of truth</line>
<line>Will give you satisfaction, you might have&#8217;t.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OTH.</speaker>
<line>Give me a living reason she&#8217;s disloyal.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line>I do not like the office;</line>
<line>But sith I am ent&#8217;red in this cause so far</line>
<line>(Prick&#8217;d to&#8217;t by foolish honesty and love),</line>
<line>I will go on. I lay with Cassio lately,</line>
<line>And being troubled with a raging tooth,</line>
<line>I could not sleep.</line>
<line>There are a kind of men, so loose of soul,</line>
<line>That in their sleeps will mutter their affairs;</line>
<line>One of this kind is Cassio.</line>
<line>In sleep I heard him say, &#8220;Sweet Desdemona,</line>
<line>Let us be wary, let us hide our loves&#8221;;</line>
<line>And then, sir, would he gripe and wring my hand;</line>
<line>Cry, &#8220;O sweet creature!&#8221; then kiss me hard,</line>
<line>As if he pluck&#8217;d up kisses by the roots</line>
<line>That grew upon my lips; then laid his leg</line>
<line>Over my thigh, and sigh&#8217;d, and kiss&#8217;d, and then</line>
<line>Cried, &#8220;Cursed fate that gave thee to the Moor!&#8221;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OTH.</speaker>
<line>O monstrous! Monstrous!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Nay, this was but his dream.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OTH.</speaker>
<line>But this denoted a foregone conclusion.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line>&#8217;Tis a shrewd doubt, though it be but a dream,</line>
<line>And this may help to thicken other proofs</line>
<line>That do demonstrate thinly.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OTH.</speaker>
<line offset="5">I&#8217;ll tear her all to pieces.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line>Nay, yet be wise; yet we see nothing done;</line>
<line>She may be honest yet. Tell me but this,</line>
<line>Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief</line>
<line>Spotted with strawberries in your wive&#8217;s hand?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OTH.</speaker>
<line>I gave her such a one; &#8217;twas my first gift.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line>I know not that; but such a handkerchief</line>
<line>(I am sure it was your wive&#8217;s) did I today</line>
<line>See Cassio wipe his beard with.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OTH.</speaker>
<line offset="7">If it be that&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line>If it be that, or any that was hers,</line>
<line>It speaks against her with the other proofs.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OTH.</speaker>
<line>O that the slave had forty thousand lives!</line>
<line>One is too poor, too weak for my revenge.</line>
<line>Now do I see &#8217;tis true. Look here, Iago,</line>
<line>All my fond love thus do I blow to heaven.</line>
<line>&#8217;Tis gone.</line>
<line>Arise, black vengeance, from the hollow hell!</line>
<line>Yield up, O love, thy crown and hearted throne</line>
<line>To tyrannous hate! Swell, bosom, with thy fraught,</line>
<line>For &#8217;tis of aspics&#8217; tongues!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Yet be content.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OTH.</speaker>
<line>O blood, blood, blood!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line>Patience, I say; your mind perhaps may change.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OTH.</speaker>
<line>Never, Iago. Like to the Pontic Sea,</line>
<line>Whose icy current and compulsive course</line>
<line>Nev&#8217;r feels retiring ebb, but keeps due on</line>
<line>To the Propontic and the Hellespont,</line>
<line>Even so my bloody thoughts, with violent pace,</line>
<line>Shall nev&#8217;r look back, nev&#8217;r ebb to humble love,</line>
<line>Till that a capable and wide revenge</line>
<line>Swallow them up.</line>

<stagedir>He kneels.</stagedir>

<line>Now by yond marble heaven,</line>
<line>In the due reverence of a sacred vow</line>
<line>I here engage my words.</line>

<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Do not rise yet.</line>

<stagedir>Iago kneels.</stagedir>

<line>Witness, you ever-burning lights above,</line>
<line>You elements that clip us round about,</line>
<line>Witness that here Iago doth give up</line>
<line>The execution of his wit, hands, heart,</line>
<line>To wrong&#8217;d Othello&#8217;s service! Let him command,</line>
<line>And to obey shall be in me remorse,</line>
<line>What bloody business ever.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>They rise.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>OTH.</speaker>
<line offset="6">I greet thy love,</line>
<line>Not with vain thanks, but with acceptance bounteous,</line>

<line>Within these three days let me hear thee say</line>
<line>That Cassio&#8217;s not alive.</line>

<line>My friend is dead; &#8217;tis done at your request.</line>

<line>Damn her, lewd minx! O, damn her, damn her!</line>
<line>Come go with me apart, I will withdraw</line>

<line>Do you know, sirrah, where Lieutenant Cassio lies?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CLO.</speaker>
<line>I dare not say he lies any where.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DES.</speaker>
<line>Why, man?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CLO.</speaker>
<line>He&#8217;s a soldier, and for me to say a soldier lies, &#8217;tis stabbing.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DES.</speaker>
<line>Go to! Where lodges he?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CLO.</speaker>
<line>To tell you where he lodges, is to tell you where I lie.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DES.</speaker>
<line>Can any thing be made of this?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CLO.</speaker>
<line>I know not where he lodges, and for me to devise a lodging and say he lies here, or he lies there, were to lie in mine own throat.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DES.</speaker>
<line>Can you inquire him out, and be edified by report?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CLO.</speaker>
<line>I will catechize the world for him, that is, make questions, and by them answer.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DES.</speaker>
<line>Seek him, bid him come hither. Tell him I have mov&#8217;d my lord on his behalf, and hope all will be well.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CLO.</speaker>
<line>To do this is within the compass of man&#8217;s wit, and therefore I will attempt the doing it.</line>

<line>Where should I lose the handkerchief, Emilia?</line>

<line>I know not, madam.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DES.</speaker>
<line>Believe me, I had rather have lost my purse</line>
<line>Full of crusadoes; and but my noble Moor</line>
<line>Is true of mind, and made of no such baseness</line>
<line>As jealious creatures are, it were enough</line>
<line>To put him to ill thinking.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>EMIL.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Is he not jealious?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DES.</speaker>
<line>Who, he? I think the sun where he was born</line>
<line>Drew all such humors from him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>EMIL.</speaker>
<line offset="7">Look where he comes.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Othello.</stagedir>

<line>I will not leave him now till Cassio</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OTH.</speaker>
<line>Well, my good lady.</line>

<stagedir>Aside.</stagedir>

<line offset="4">O, hardness to dissemble!&#8212;</line>
<line>How do you, Desdemona?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DES.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Well, my good lord.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OTH.</speaker>
<line>Give me your hand. This hand is moist, my lady.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DES.</speaker>
<line>It yet hath felt no age nor known no sorrow.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OTH.</speaker>
<line>This argues fruitfulness and liberal heart;</line>
<line>Hot, hot, and moist. This hand of yours requires</line>
<line>A sequester from liberty: fasting and prayer,</line>
<line>Much castigation, exercise devout,</line>
<line>For here&#8217;s a young and sweating devil here</line>
<line>That commonly rebels. &#8217;Tis a good hand,</line>
<line>A frank one.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DES.</speaker>
<line offset="3">You may, indeed, say so;</line>
<line>For &#8217;twas that hand that gave away my heart.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OTH.</speaker>
<line>A liberal hand. The hearts of old gave hands;</line>
<line>But our new heraldry is hands, not hearts.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DES.</speaker>
<line>I cannot speak of this. Come now, your promise.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OTH.</speaker>
<line>What promise, chuck?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DES.</speaker>
<line>I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OTH.</speaker>
<line>I have a salt and sorry rheum offends me;</line>
<line>Lend me thy handkerchief.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DES.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Here, my lord.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OTH.</speaker>
<line>That which I gave you.</line>

<line>Not?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DES.</speaker>
<line offset="2">No, faith, my lord.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OTH.</speaker>
<line>That&#8217;s a fault. That handkerchief</line>
<line>Did an Egyptian to my mother give;</line>
<line>She was a charmer, and could almost read</line>
<line>The thoughts of people. She told her, while she kept it,</line>
<line>&#8217;Twould make her amiable, and subdue my father</line>
<line>Entirely to her love; but if she lost it,</line>
<line>Or made a gift of it, my father&#8217;s eye</line>
<line>Should hold her loathed, and his spirits should hunt</line>
<line>After new fancies. She, dying, gave it me,</line>
<line>And bid me, when my fate would have me wiv&#8217;d,</line>
<line>To give it her. I did so; and take heed on&#8217;t,</line>
<line>Make it a darling like your precious eye.</line>
<line>To lose&#8217;t or give&#8217;t away were such perdition</line>
<line>As nothing else could match.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>DES.</speaker>
<line offset="6">Is&#8217;t possible?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OTH.</speaker>
<line>&#8217;Tis true; there&#8217;s magic in the web of it.</line>
<line>A sibyl, that had numb&#8217;red in the world</line>
<line>The sun to course two hundred compasses,</line>
<line>In her prophetic fury sew&#8217;d the work;</line>
<line>The worms were hallowed that did breed the silk,</line>
<line>And it was dy&#8217;d in mummy which the skillful</line>
<line>Conserv&#8217;d of maidens&#8217; hearts.</line>

<line offset="6">I&#8217; faith! Is&#8217;t true?</line>

<line>Why do you speak so startingly and rash?</line>

<line>It is not lost; but what and if it were?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OTH.</speaker>
<line>How?</line>

<line>I say, it is not lost.</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DES.</speaker>
<line>Why, so I can, sir, but I will not now.</line>
<line>This is a trick to put me from my suit.</line>
<line>Pray you let Cassio be receiv&#8217;d again.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OTH.</speaker>
<line>Fetch me the handkerchief, my mind misgives.</line>

<line>I nev&#8217;r saw this before.</line>
<line>Sure, there&#8217;s some wonder in this handkerchief;</line>
<line>I am most unhappy in the loss of it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>EMIL.</speaker>
<line>&#8217;Tis not a year or two shows us a man:</line>
<line>They are all but stomachs, and we all but food;</line>

<stagedir>Enter Iago and Cassio.</stagedir>

<line offset="3">Look you, Cassio and my husband!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line>There is no other way: &#8217;tis she must do&#8217;t;</line>
<line>And lo the happiness! Go, and importune her.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>DES.</speaker>
<line>How now, good Cassio, what&#8217;s the news with you?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CAS.</speaker>
<line>Madam, my former suit. I do beseech you</line>
<line>That by your virtuous means I may again</line>
<line>Exist, and be a member of his love</line>
<line>Whom I, with all the office of my heart,</line>
<line>Entirely honor. I would not be delay&#8217;d.</line>
<line>If my offense be of such mortal kind</line>
<line>That nor my service past, nor present sorrows,</line>
<line>Nor purpos&#8217;d merit in futurity,</line>
<line>Can ransom me into his love again,</line>
<line>But to know so must be my benefit;</line>
<line>So shall I clothe me in a forc&#8217;d content,</line>
<line>And shut myself up in some other course,</line>
<line>To fortune&#8217;s alms.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DES.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Alas, thrice-gentle Cassio,</line>
<line>My advocation is not now in tune.</line>
<line>My lord is not my lord; nor should I know him</line>
<line>Were he in favor as in humor alter&#8217;d.</line>
<line>So help me every spirit sanctified,</line>
<line>As I have spoken for you all my best,</line>
<line>And stood within the blank of his displeasure</line>
<line>For my free speech! You must awhile be patient.</line>
<line>What I can do, I will; and more I will</line>

<line offset="4">He went hence but now;</line>
<line>And certainly in strange unquietness.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line>Can he be angry? I have seen the cannon</line>
<line>When it hath blown his ranks into the air,</line>
<line>And like the devil from his very arm</line>
<line>Puff&#8217;d his own brother&#8212;and is he angry?</line>
<line>Something of moment then. I will go meet him.</line>
<line>There&#8217;s matter in&#8217;t indeed, if he be angry.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DES.</speaker>
<line>I prithee do so.</line>

<stagedir>Exit Iago.</stagedir>

<line offset="3">Something sure of state,</line>
<line>Either from Venice, or some unhatch&#8217;d practice</line>
<line>Made demonstrable here in Cyprus to him,</line>
<line>Hath puddled his clear spirit; and in such cases</line>
<line>Men&#8217;s natures wrangle with inferior things,</line>
<line>Though great ones are their object. &#8217;Tis even so;</line>
<line>For let our finger ache, and it endues</line>
<line>Our other healthful members even to a sense</line>
<line>Of pain. Nay, we must think men are not gods,</line>
<line>Nor of them look for such observancy</line>
<line>As fits the bridal. Beshrew me much, Emilia,</line>
<line>I was (unhandsome warrior as I am)</line>
<line>Arraigning his unkindness with my soul;</line>

<line>But jealious souls will not be answer&#8217;d so;</line>
<line>They are not ever jealious for the cause,</line>

<stagedir>Enter Othello and Iago.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line>Will you think so?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OTH.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Think so, Iago?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line offset="8">What,</line>
<line>To kiss in private?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OTH.</speaker>
<line offset="4">An unauthoriz&#8217;d kiss!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line>Or to be naked with her friend in bed</line>
<line>An hour, or more, not meaning any harm?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OTH.</speaker>
<line>Naked in bed, Iago, and not mean harm?</line>
<line>It is hypocrisy against the devil.</line>
<line>They that mean virtuously, and yet do so,</line>
<line>The devil their virtue tempts, and they tempt heaven.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line>If they do nothing, &#8217;tis a venial slip;</line>
<line>But if I give my wife a handkerchief&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OTH.</speaker>
<line>What then?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line>Why then &#8217;tis hers, my lord, and being hers,</line>
<line>She may, I think, bestow&#8217;t on any man.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OTH.</speaker>
<line>She is protectress of her honor too;</line>
<line>May she give that?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line>Her honor is an essence that&#8217;s not seen;</line>
<line>They have it very oft that have it not.</line>
<line>But for the handkerchief&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OTH.</speaker>
<line>By heaven, I would most gladly have forgot it.</line>
<line>Thou saidst (O, it comes o&#8217;er my memory,</line>
<line>As doth the raven o&#8217;er the infectious house,</line>
<line>Boding to all) he had my handkerchief.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line>Ay; what of that?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OTH.</speaker>
<line offset="4">That&#8217;s not so good now.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line offset="9">What</line>
<line>If I had said I had seen him do you wrong?</line>
<line>Or heard him say&#8212;as knaves be such abroad,</line>
<line>Who having by their own importunate suit,</line>
<line>Or voluntary dotage of some mistress,</line>
<line>Convinced or supplied them, cannot choose</line>
<line>But they must blab&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OTH.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Hath he said any thing?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line>He hath, my lord, but be you well assur&#8217;d,</line>
<line>No more than he&#8217;ll unswear.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OTH.</speaker>
<line offset="5">What hath he said?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line>Faith, that he did&#8212;I know not what he did.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OTH.</speaker>
<line>What? What?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line>Lie&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OTH.</speaker>
<line offset="3">With her?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line offset="5">With her? On her; what you will.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OTH.</speaker>
<line>Lie with her? Lie on her? We say lie on her, when they belie her. Lie with her! &#8217;Zounds, that&#8217;s fulsome! Handkerchief&#8212;confessions&#8212;handkerchief! To confess, and be hang&#8217;d for his labor&#8212;first to be hang&#8217;d, and then to confess. I tremble at it. Nature would not invest herself in such shadowing passion without some instruction. It is not words that shakes me thus. Pish! Noses, ears, and lips. Is&#8217;t possible? Confess? Handkerchief? O devil!</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Falls in a trance.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line>Work on,</line>
<line>My medicine, work! Thus credulous fools are caught,</line>
<line>And many worthy and chaste dames even thus</line>
<line>(All guiltless) meet reproach.&#8212;What ho! My lord!</line>
<line>My lord, I say! Othello!</line>

<stagedir>Enter Cassio.</stagedir>

<line offset="5">How now, Cassio?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CAS.</speaker>
<line>What&#8217;s the matter?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line>My lord is fall&#8217;n into an epilepsy.</line>
<line>This is his second fit; he had one yesterday.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CAS.</speaker>
<line>Rub him about the temples.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line offset="7">No, forbear,</line>
<line>The lethargy must have his quiet course;</line>
<line>If not, he foams at mouth, and by and by</line>
<line>Breaks out to savage madness. Look, he stirs.</line>
<line>Do you withdraw yourself a little while,</line>
<line>He will recover straight. When he is gone,</line>
<line>I would on great occasion speak with you.</line>

<stagedir>Exit Cassio.</stagedir>

<line>How is it, general? Have you not hurt your head?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OTH.</speaker>
<line>Dost thou mock me?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line offset="4">I mock you not, by heaven.</line>
<line>Would you would bear your fortune like a man!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OTH.</speaker>
<line>A horned man&#8217;s a monster and a beast.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line>There&#8217;s many a beast then in a populous city,</line>
<line>And many a civil monster.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OTH.</speaker>
<line>Did he confess it?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Good sir, be a man;</line>
<line>Think every bearded fellow that&#8217;s but yok&#8217;d</line>
<line>May draw with you. There&#8217;s millions now alive</line>
<line>That nightly lie in those unproper beds</line>
<line>Which they dare swear peculiar; your case is better.</line>
<line>O, &#8217;tis the spite of hell, the fiend&#8217;s arch-mock,</line>
<line>To lip a wanton in a secure couch,</line>
<line>And to suppose her chaste! No, let me know,</line>
<line>And knowing what I am, I know what she shall be.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OTH.</speaker>
<line>O, thou art wise; &#8217;tis certain.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Stand you a while apart,</line>
<line>Confine yourself but in a patient list.</line>
<line>Whilst you were here o&#8217;erwhelmed with your grief</line>
<line>(A passion most unsuiting such a man),</line>
<line>Cassio came hither. I shifted him away,</line>
<line>And laid good &#8217;scuses upon your ecstasy;</line>
<line>Bade him anon return and here speak with me,</line>
<line>The which he promis&#8217;d. Do but encave yourself,</line>
<line>And mark the fleers, the gibes, and notable scorns</line>
<line>That dwell in every region of his face,</line>
<line>For I will make him tell the tale anew:</line>
<line>Where, how, how oft, how long ago, and when</line>
<line>He hath, and is again to cope your wife.</line>
<line>I say, but mark his gesture. Marry, patience,</line>
<line>Or I shall say y&#8217; are all in all in spleen,</line>
<line>And nothing of a man.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OTH.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Dost thou hear, Iago,</line>
<line>I will be found most cunning in my patience;</line>
<line>But (dost thou hear) most bloody.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line offset="7">That&#8217;s not amiss,</line>
<line>But yet keep time in all. Will you withdraw?</line>

<stagedir>Othello withdraws.</stagedir>

<line>Now will I question Cassio of Bianca,</line>
<line>A huswife that by selling her desires</line>
<line>Buys herself bread and clothes. It is a creature</line>
<line>That dotes on Cassio (as &#8217;tis the strumpet&#8217;s plague</line>
<line>To beguile many and be beguil&#8217;d by one);</line>
<line>He, when he hears of her, cannot restrain</line>
<line>From the excess of laughter. Here he comes.</line>

<stagedir>Enter Cassio.</stagedir>

<line>As he shall smile, Othello shall go mad;</line>
<line>And his unbookish jealousy must construe</line>
<line>Poor Cassio&#8217;s smiles, gestures, and light behaviors</line>
<line>Quite in the wrong. How do you now, lieutenant?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CAS.</speaker>
<line>The worser that you give me the addition</line>
<line>Whose want even kills me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line>Ply Desdemona well, and you are sure on&#8217;t.</line>

<stagedir>Speaking lower.</stagedir>

<line>Now, if this suit lay in Bianca&#8217;s pow&#8217;r,</line>
<line>How quickly should you speed!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CAS.</speaker>
<line offset="6">Alas, poor caitiff!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OTH.</speaker>
<line>Look how he laughs already!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line>I never knew woman love man so.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CAS.</speaker>
<line>Alas, poor rogue, I think, i&#8217; faith, she loves me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OTH.</speaker>
<line>Now he denies it faintly, and laughs it out.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line>Do you hear, Cassio?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OTH.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Now he importunes him</line>
<line>To tell it o&#8217;er. Go to, well said, well said.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line>She gives it out that you shall marry her.</line>
<line>Do you intend it?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CAS.</speaker>
<line>Ha, ha, ha!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OTH.</speaker>
<line>Do you triumph, Roman? Do you triumph?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CAS.</speaker>
<line>I marry her! What? A customer! Prithee bear some charity to my wit, do not think it so unwholesome. Ha, ha, ha!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OTH.</speaker>
<line>So, so, so, so; they laugh that wins.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line>Faith, the cry goes that you marry her.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CAS.</speaker>
<line>Prithee say true.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line>I am a very villain else.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OTH.</speaker>
<line>Have you scor&#8217;d me? Well.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CAS.</speaker>
<line>This is the monkey&#8217;s own giving out. She is persuaded I will marry her, out of her own love and flattery, not out of my promise.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OTH.</speaker>
<line>Iago beckons me; now he begins the story.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CAS.</speaker>
<line>She was here even now; she haunts me in every place. I was the other day talking on the sea-bank with certain Venetians, and thither comes the bauble, and by this hand, falls me thus about my neck&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OTH.</speaker>
<line>Crying, &#8220;O dear Cassio!&#8221; as it were; his gesture imports it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CAS.</speaker>
<line>So hangs, and lolls, and weeps upon me; so hales and pulls me. Ha, ha, ha!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OTH.</speaker>
<line>Now he tells how she pluck&#8217;d him to my chamber. O, I see that nose of yours, but not that dog I shall throw it to.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CAS.</speaker>
<line>Well, I must leave her company.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line>Before me! Look where she comes.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Bianca.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>CAS.</speaker>
<line>&#8217;Tis such another fitchew! Marry, a perfum&#8217;d one!&#8212;What do you mean by this haunting of me?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BIAN.</speaker>
<line>Let the devil and his dam haunt you! What did you mean by that same handkerchief you gave me even now? I was a fine fool to take it. I must take out the work? A likely piece of work, that you should find it in your chamber, and know not who left it there! This is some minx&#8217;s token, and I must take out the work? There, give it your hobby-horse. Wheresoever you had it, I&#8217;ll take out no work on&#8217;t.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CAS.</speaker>
<line>How now, my sweet Bianca? How now? How now?</line>
</speech>

<speech>

<line>By heaven, that should be my handkerchief!</line>

<line>Will you sup there?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CAS.</speaker>
<line>Faith, I intend so.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line>Well, I may chance to see you; for I would very fain speak with you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>

<line>Prithee come; will you?</line>

<speech>
<speaker>OTH.</speaker>
<line>Was that mine?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line>Yours, by this hand. And to see how he prizes the foolish woman your wife! She gave it him, and he hath giv&#8217;n it his whore.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OTH.</speaker>
<line>I would have him nine years a-killing. A fine woman! A fair woman! A sweet woman!</line>

<line>Nay, you must forget that.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OTH.</speaker>
<line>Ay, let her rot, and perish, and be damn&#8217;d tonight, for she shall not live. No, my heart is turn&#8217;d to stone; I strike it, and it hurts my hand. O, the world hath not a sweeter creature! She might lie by an emperor&#8217;s side and command him tasks.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line>Nay, that&#8217;s not your way.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OTH.</speaker>
<line>Hang her, I do but say what she is. So delicate with her needle! An admirable musician! O, she will sing the savageness out of a bear. Of so high and plenteous wit and invention!</line>

<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line>She&#8217;s the worse for all this.</line>

<line>O, a thousand, a thousand times. And then of so gentle a condition!</line>

<line>Ay, too gentle.</line>

<line>Nay, that&#8217;s certain. But yet the pity of it, Iago! O Iago, the pity of it, Iago!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line>If you are so fond over her iniquity, give her patent to offend, for if it touch not you, it comes near nobody.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OTH.</speaker>
<line>I will chop her into messes. Cuckold me!</line>

<line>Do it not with poison; strangle her in her bed, even the bed she hath contaminated.</line>

<speaker>OTH.</speaker>
<line>Yes, you have seen Cassio and she together.</line>

<line>I durst, my lord, to wager she is honest;</line>

<line>Remove your thought; it doth abuse your bosom.</line>
<line>If any wretch have put this in your head,</line>
<line>Let heaven requite it with the serpent&#8217;s curse!</line>

<line>Why should he call her whore? Who keeps her company?</line>
<line>What place? What time? What form? What likelihood?</line>
<line>The Moor&#8217;s abus&#8217;d by some most villainous knave,</line>
<line>Some base notorious knave, some scurvy fellow.</line>
<line>O heaven, that such companions thou&#8217;dst unfold,</line>
<line>And put in every honest hand a whip</line>

<line offset="5">Alas, Iago,</line>
<line>What shall I do to win my lord again?</line>
<line>Good friend, go to him; for by this light of heaven,</line>
<line>I know not how I lost him. Here I kneel:</line>
<line>If e&#8217;er my will did trespass &#8217;gainst his love,</line>
<line>Either in discourse of thought or actual deed,</line>
<line>Or that mine eyes, mine ears, or any sense</line>
<line>Delighted them in any other form;</line>
<line>Or that I do not yet, and ever did,</line>
<line>And ever will (though he do shake me off</line>
<line>To beggarly divorcement) love him dearly,</line>
<line>Comfort forswear me! Unkindness may do much,</line>
<line>And his unkindness may defeat my life,</line>
<line>But never taint my love. I cannot say &#8220;whore.&#8221;</line>
<line>It does abhor me now I speak the word;</line>
<line>To do the act that might the addition earn,</line>
<line>Not the world&#8217;s mass of vanity could make me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line>I pray you be content; &#8217;tis but his humor.</line>
<line>The business of the state does him offense,</line>
<line>And he does chide with you.</line>

<stagedir>Enter Roderigo.</stagedir>

<line>How now, Roderigo?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROD.</speaker>
<line>I do not find that thou deal&#8217;st justly with me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line>What in the contrary?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROD.</speaker>
<line>Every day thou daff&#8217;st me with some device, Iago, and rather, as it seems to me now, keep&#8217;st from me all conveniency than suppliest me with the least advantage of hope. I will indeed no longer endure it; nor am I yet persuaded to put up in peace what already I have foolishly suff&#8217;red.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line>Will you hear me, Roderigo?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROD.</speaker>
<line>Faith, I have heard too much; for your words and performances are no kin together.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line>You charge me most unjustly.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROD.</speaker>
<line>With nought but truth. I have wasted myself out of my means. The jewels you have had from me to deliver Desdemona would half have corrupted a votarist. You have told me she hath receiv&#8217;d them and return&#8217;d me expectations and comforts of sudden respect and acquaintance, but I find none.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line>Well, go to; very well.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROD.</speaker>
<line>Very well! Go to! I cannot go to, man, nor &#8217;tis not very well. By this hand, I think it is scurvy, and begin to find myself fopp&#8217;d in it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line>Very well.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROD.</speaker>
<line>I tell you &#8217;tis not very well. I will make myself known to Desdemona. If she will return me my jewels, I will give over my suit and repent my unlawful solicitation; if not, assure yourself I will seek satisfaction of you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line>You have said now.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROD.</speaker>
<line>Ay; and said nothing but what I protest intendment of doing.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line>Why, now I see there&#8217;s mettle in thee, and even from this instant do build on thee a better opinion than ever before. Give me thy hand, Roderigo. Thou hast taken against me a most just exception; but yet I protest I have dealt most directly in thy affair.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROD.</speaker>
<line>It hath not appear&#8217;d.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line>I grant indeed it hath not appear&#8217;d; and your suspicion is not without wit and judgment. But, Roderigo, if thou hast that in thee indeed, which I have greater reason to believe now than ever (I mean purpose, courage, and valor), this night show it. If thou the next night following enjoy not Desdemona, take me from this world with treachery and devise engines for my life.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROD.</speaker>
<line>Well; what is it? Is it within reason and compass?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line>Sir, there is especial commission come from Venice to depute Cassio in Othello&#8217;s place.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROD.</speaker>
<line>Is that true? Why then Othello and Desdemona return again to Venice.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line>O no; he goes into Mauritania and taketh away with him the fair Desdemona, unless his abode be ling&#8217;red here by some accident; wherein none can be so determinate as the removing of Cassio.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROD.</speaker>
<line>How do you mean, removing him?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line>Why, by making him uncapable of Othello&#8217;s place: knocking out his brains.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROD.</speaker>
<line>And that you would have me to do?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line>Ay; if you dare do yourself a profit and a right. He sups tonight with a harlotry, and thither will I go to him&#8212;he knows not yet of his honorable fortune. If you will watch his going thence (which I will fashion to fall out between twelve and one), you may take him at your pleasure. I will be near to second your attempt, and he shall fall between us. Come, stand not amaz&#8217;d at it, but go along with me; I will show you such a necessity in his death that you shall think yourself bound to put it on him. It is now high supper-time, and the night grows to waste. About it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROD.</speaker>
<line>I will hear further reason for this.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line>And you shall be satisfied.</line>

<line>Good troth, I think thou wouldst not.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>EMIL.</speaker>
<line>By my troth, I think I should, and undo&#8217;t when I had done&#8217;t. Marry, I would not do such a thing for a joint-ring, nor for measures of lawn, nor for gowns, petticoats, nor caps, nor any petty exhibition; but, for all the whole world&#8212;&#8217;ud&#8217;s pity, who would not make her husband a cuckold to make him a monarch? I should venture purgatory for&#8217;t.</line>
</speech>

<speaker>DES.</speaker>
<line>Beshrew me, if I would do such a wrong</line>
<line>For the whole world.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>EMIL.</speaker>
<line>Why, the wrong is but a wrong i&#8217; th&#8217; world; and having the world for your labor, &#8217;tis a wrong in your own world, and you might quickly make it right.</line>
</speech>

<speech>

<speaker>EMIL.</speaker>
<line>Yes, a dozen; and as many to th&#8217; vantage as would store the world they play&#8217;d for.</line>
<line>But I do think it is their husbands&#8217; faults</line>
<line>If wives do fall. Say that they slack their duties,</line>
<line>And pour our treasures into foreign laps;</line>
<line>Or else break out in peevish jealousies,</line>
<line>Throwing restraint upon us; or say they strike us,</line>
<line>Or scant our former having in despite:</line>
<line>Why, we have galls; and though we have some grace,</line>
<line>Yet have we some revenge. Let husbands know</line>
<line>Their wives have sense like them; they see, and smell,</line>
<line>And have their palates both for sweet and sour,</line>
<line>As husbands have. What is it that they do</line>
<line>When they change us for others? Is it sport?</line>
<line>I think it is. And doth affection breed it?</line>
<line>I think it doth. Is&#8217;t frailty that thus errs?</line>
<line>It is so too. And have not we affections,</line>
<line>Desires for sport, and frailty, as men have?</line>
<line>Then let them use us well; else let them know,</line>
<line>The ills we do, their ills instruct us so.</line>

<line>It was a sword of Spain, the ice-brook&#8217;s temper&#8212;</line>
<line>O, here it is. Uncle, I must come forth.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GRA.</speaker> <stagedir>Within.</stagedir>
<line>If thou attempt it, it will cost thee dear:</line>
<line>Thou hast no weapon, and perforce must suffer.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OTH.</speaker>
<line>Look in upon me then and speak with me,</line>
<line>Or naked as I am I will assault thee.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Gratiano.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>GRA.</speaker>
<line>What is the matter?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OTH.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Behold, I have a weapon;</line>
<line>A better never did itself sustain</line>
<line>Upon a soldier&#8217;s thigh. I have seen the day</line>
<line>That with this little arm, and this good sword,</line>
<line>I have made my way through more impediments</line>
<line>Than twenty times your stop. But (O vain boast!)</line>
<line>Who can control his fate? &#8217;Tis not so now.</line>
<line>Be not afraid though you do see me weapon&#8217;d;</line>
<line>Here is my journey&#8217;s end, here is my butt</line>
<line>And very sea-mark of my utmost sail.</line>
<line>Do you go back dismay&#8217;d? &#8217;Tis a lost fear;</line>
<line>Man but a rush against Othello&#8217;s breast,</line>
<line>And he retires. Where should Othello go?</line>
<line>Now&#8212;how dost thou look now? O ill-starr&#8217;d wench,</line>
<line>Pale as thy smock! When we shall meet at compt,</line>
<line>This look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven,</line>
<line>And fiends will snatch at it. Cold, cold, my girl?</line>
<line>Even like thy chastity. O cursed, cursed slave!</line>
<line>Whip me, ye devils,</line>
<line>From the possession of this heavenly sight!</line>
<line>Blow me about in winds! Roast me in sulphur!</line>
<line>Wash me in steep-down gulfs of liquid fire!</line>
<line>O Desdemon! Dead, Desdemon! Dead!</line>
<line>O, O!</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Lodovico, Cassio in a chair, Montano, and Iago guarded, with Officers.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>LOD.</speaker>
<line>Where is this rash and most unfortunate man?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OTH.</speaker>
<line>That&#8217;s he that was Othello; here I am.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LOD.</speaker>
<line>Where is that viper? Bring the villain forth.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OTH.</speaker>
<line>I look down towards his feet; but that&#8217;s a fable.</line>
<line>If that thou be&#8217;st a devil, I cannot kill thee.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Wounds Iago.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>LOD.</speaker>
<line>Wrench his sword from him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line offset="5">I bleed, sir, but not kill&#8217;d.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OTH.</speaker>
<line>I am not sorry neither, I&#8217;ld have thee live;</line>
<line>For in my sense, &#8217;tis happiness to die.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LOD.</speaker>
<line>O thou Othello, that was once so good,</line>
<line>Fall&#8217;n in the practice of a damned slave,</line>
<line>What shall be said to thee?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OTH.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Why, any thing:</line>
<line>An honorable murderer, if you will;</line>
<line>For nought I did in hate, but all in honor.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LOD.</speaker>
<line>This wretch hath part confess&#8217;d his villainy.</line>
<line>Did you and he consent in Cassio&#8217;s death?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OTH.</speaker>
<line>Ay.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CAS.</speaker>
<line>Dear general, I never gave you cause.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OTH.</speaker>
<line>I do believe it, and I ask your pardon.</line>
<line>Will you, I pray, demand that demi-devil</line>
<line>Why he hath thus ensnar&#8217;d my soul and body?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>IAGO.</speaker>
<line>Demand me nothing; what you know, you know:</line>
<line>From this time forth I never will speak word.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LOD.</speaker>
<line>What? Not to pray?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GRA.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Torments will ope your lips.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OTH.</speaker>
<line>Well, thou dost best.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LOD.</speaker>
<line>Sir, you shall understand what hath befall&#8217;n,</line>
<line>Which, as I think, you know not. Here is a letter</line>
<line>Found in the pocket of the slain Roderigo,</line>
<line>And here another. The one of them imports</line>
<line>The death of Cassio to be undertook</line>
<line>By Roderigo.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OTH.</speaker>
<line>O villain!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CAS.</speaker>
<line offset="3">Most heathenish and most gross!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LOD.</speaker>
<line>Now here&#8217;s another discontented paper,</line>
<line>Found in his pocket too; and this it seems</line>
<line>Roderigo meant t&#8217; have sent this damned villain;</line>
<line>But that, belike, Iago in the nick</line>
<line>Came in and satisfied him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OTH.</speaker>
<line offset="5">O thou pernicious caitiff!&#8212;</line>
<line>How came you, Cassio, by that handkerchief</line>
<line>That was my wive&#8217;s?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CAS.</speaker>
<line offset="4">I found it in my chamber:</line>
<line>And he himself confess&#8217;d it but even now,</line>
<line>That there he dropp&#8217;d it for a special purpose</line>
<line>Which wrought to his desire.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OTH.</speaker>
<line offset="6">O fool, fool, fool!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CAS.</speaker>
<line>There is besides, in Roderigo&#8217;s letter,</line>
<line>How he upbraids Iago, that he made him</line>
<line>Brave me upon the watch, whereon it came</line>
<line>That I was cast; and even but now he spake</line>
<line>(After long seeming dead) Iago hurt him,</line>
<line>Iago set him on.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LOD.</speaker>
<line>You must forsake this room and go with us.</line>
<line>Your power and your command is taken off,</line>
<line>And Cassio rules in Cyprus. For this slave,</line>
<line>If there be any cunning cruelty</line>
<line>That can torment him much, and hold him long,</line>
<line>It shall be his. You shall close prisoner rest,</line>
<line>Till that the nature of your fault be known</line>
<line>To the Venetian state. Come, bring away.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OTH.</speaker>
<line>Soft you; a word or two before you go.</line>
<line>I have done the state some service, and they know&#8217;t&#8212;</line>
<line>No more of that. I pray you, in your letters,</line>
<line>When you shall these unlucky deeds relate,</line>
<line>Speak of me as I am; nothing extenuate,</line>
<line>Nor set down aught in malice. Then must you speak</line>
<line>Of one that lov&#8217;d not wisely but too well;</line>
<line>Of one not easily jealious, but being wrought,</line>
<line>Perplexed in the extreme; of one whose hand</line>
<line>(Like the base Indian) threw a pearl away</line>
<line>Richer than all his tribe; of one whose subdu&#8217;d eyes,</line>
<line>Albeit unused to the melting mood,</line>
<line>Drops tears as fast as the Arabian trees</line>
<line>Their medicinable gum. Set you down this;</line>
<line>And say besides, that in Aleppo once,</line>
<line>Where a malignant and a turban&#8217;d Turk</line>
<line>Beat a Venetian and traduc&#8217;d the state,</line>
<line>I took by th&#8217; throat the circumcised dog,</line>
<line>And smote him&#8212;thus.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>He stabs himself.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>LOD.</speaker>
<line>O bloody period!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GRA.</speaker>
<line offset="4">All that is spoke is marr&#8217;d.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OTH.</speaker>
<line>I kiss&#8217;d thee ere I kill&#8217;d thee. No way but this,</line>
<line>Killing myself, to die upon a kiss.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Falls on the bed and dies.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>CAS.</speaker>
<line>This did I fear, but thought he had no weapon;</line>
<line>For he was great of heart.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LOD.</speaker> <stagedir>To Iago.</stagedir>
<line offset="5">O Spartan dog,</line>
<line>More fell than anguish, hunger, or the sea!</line>
<line>Look on the tragic loading of this bed;</line>
<line>This is thy work. The object poisons sight,</line>
<line>Let it be hid. Gratiano, keep the house,</line>
<line>And seize upon the fortunes of the Moor,</line>
<line>For they succeed on you. To you, Lord Governor,</line>
<line>Remains the censure of this hellish villain,</line>
<line>The time, the place, the torture, O, enforce it!</line>
<line>Myself will straight aboard, and to the state</line>
<line>This heavy act with heavy heart relate.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exeunt.</stagedir>
