<persona gender="male">
<persname short="K. RICH.">King Richard the Second</persname>
<persdescription>Richard II is King of England, John of Gaunt&#8217;s nephew and Bullingbrook&#8217;s cousin. Authoritarian, unwilling to listen to good advice, friendly with persons not of noble birth, he is not the sort of king likely to earn his noblemen&#8217;s love. He over-taxes the country, finding many new ways of raising revenue, most of which appears to be wasted. Richard most likely had some part in his uncle the Duke of Gloucester&#8217;s death, and is worried that this will come to light. A great talker, Richard is given to flights of fancy rhetoric, something quite beyond his cousin Bullingbrook. He believes strongly in the divine right of Kings, and when misfortune comes upon him often compares himself to Jesus. He is nevertheless insecure enough that when faced with utter rebellion, he gives up his throne to his cousin without ever being directly asked to do so. He is keenly aware of the dangers attendant on kingship, especially those who are rebelled against, and just how few die a natural death. He is not very sensible, and refuses to listen to the good advice of old people, preferring to listen to his flattering friends. He respects John of Gaunt highly until the latter reproaches him on his conduct, at which point he quite overreacts at the old man. Needing money to fight a war in Ireland, he is foolish enough to confiscate the wealth of the recently-deceased Gaunt, not heeding his uncle York&#8217;s warnings that this will undermine his own right to the throne. Absent from England for a day too long, he is left bereft of friends and quite unable to fight off Bullingbrook&#8217;s rebellion. He is aware that all is over for him apparently even before Bullingbrook has concluded this, and follows orders docilely once he realizes that there is nothing to be done. With no option but to give up the crown, he still manages to completely upstage his cousin while officially relinquishing the state to him. He grows contemplative in prison. Though he has shown no great signs of bravery in the rest of his life, this son of the Black Prince is energetic enough in his own defense when his murderers come upon him, managing to steal a weapon from one and kill two of them before being struck down. By all appearances, he is very fond of his wife.</persdescription>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="GAUNT.">John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster</persname>
<persdescription>John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, is Richard&#8217;s uncle, Bullingbrook&#8217;s father, and probably the most respected man in the kingdom. An old man, he is one of the sons of Edward III. He is deeply loyal, both to the King and to his country, and is broken-hearted that the one is betraying the other. He is also immensely rich, a fact his nephew is well-aware of. He loves his son Bullingbrook dearly, though he expects obedience from the young man. He finds his loyalties divided between love for his son and respect for his sovereign, but he allows the latter to overcome the former, agreeing to Bullingbrook&#8217;s exile despite his wish that his son could stay, and refusing to look too far into the matter of his brother Gloucester&#8217;s murder. He is keenly aware of his age, and frightened at what Richard will do once he is no longer present to offer his counsel &#8212; not that he thinks Richard listens to him much in the first place. When he knows himself dying, he is willing to tell his nephew just what he thinks of his rule, in one last forlorn hope of reforming him.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="YORK.">Edmund of Langley, Duke of York</persname>
<persdescription>The Duke of York is Richard&#8217;s uncle, John of Gaunt&#8217;s younger brother; when the latter dies, he is left the last living son of Edward III. An old, easily confused, and rather doddering old man, he is named regent of England by Richard despite his manifest lack of ability for the role. Kindly and well-intentioned, he is desperate to do the right thing. He is fully aware of Richard&#8217;s defects, particularly his extravagance and liking for fashion, but like his brother he is loyal to the crown, though he finds it difficult. He scolds his nephew when the latter appropriates Gaunt&#8217;s wealth after his death, pointing out that denying Bullingbrook his inheritance makes a mockery of Richard&#8217;s own right to the throne. This protest is ineffective, as are most of York&#8217;s protests. He talks a great deal about what he would do if he could, but he generally resigns himself to following the flow of events. His attempt to remain neutral in the contest between Richard and Bullingbrook is a lamentable failure, though he does attempt to restrain Bullingbrook from going too far. He regrets what is done to Richard, but once he has sworn fealty to Bullingbrook as King, he is firm in his loyalty, even to denouncing his son Aumerle at the risk of his life. He is not the most patient of husbands.</persdescription>

<persname short="BULL.">Henry Bullingbrook</persname>
<persaliases>
	<persname short="K. HEN.">King Henry IV</persname>
</persaliases>
<persdescription>Bullingbrook &#8212; or Henry of Derby, Duke of Hereford &#8212; is John of Gaunt&#8217;s son, Richard&#8217;s cousin, and later King Henry IV, once he has removed his cousin from the throne. He is extremely popular with the common people, something which disquiets his cousin. He is much quieter than Richard, less given to rhetorical flights, and is often silent at major turning points in his life. He is an excellent fighter, willing to risk his life on his honor&#8217;s behalf. He adores his father. On the latter&#8217;s death, he returns from exile to claim the lands that Richard has stolen from him. At this stage, he may either be a cunning politician already planning to take the throne, or he may genuinely only intend to claim his inheritance, but in either case events move very quickly. Nevertheless, it is not until his uncle York has agreed not to fight him that he announces his plans to execute the King&#8217;s favorites, taking over a right that he does not technically have. He insists to Richard that he does not intend to depose him, but does not object when his cousin offers to abdicate. Once he is in power, he attempts to sort out the mystery of his uncle the Duke of Gloucester&#8217;s death, which was at the root of his banishment, but with no success. Often monosyllabic, he distinguishes himself from Richard by his general refusal to make great speeches or otherwise engage in wordplay. He leaves the dirtier duties of his usurpation to Northumberland, especially the many executions that accompany his takeover. He attempts to be merciful when he can. Though he does not show much evidence of emotion after his return to England, Henry IV is a worried father about his eldest son, who is a wastrel spending all of his time in bars (see later plays for details). He does not order Richard&#8217;s death, but does speak suggestively on the matter in the presence of a man who will take him seriously. Faced with Richard&#8217;s body, he insists he didn&#8217;t want this to happen, and swears to make a pilgrimage to Jerusalem to earn forgiveness for the crime. As will be seen in the later plays starring him (Henry IV Part One and Part Two), he never quite gets around to it.</persdescription>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="AUM.">Duke of Aumerle</persname>
<persaliases>
	<persname short="ALL. GREEN. AND BAGOT. AND AUM. AND BUSHY.">All Green, Bagot, Aumerle and Bushy</persname>
</persaliases>
<persdescription>Aumerle is the son of the Duke and Duchess of York, and therefore Richard and Bullingbrook&#8217;s cousin. He is very much of Richard&#8217;s party; though he asks the exiled Bullingbrook to write to him, he is happy to slander him to the King. Rather a crawler, he overdoes his devotion to Richard somewhat. He accompanies the King to Ireland. When they return to find England almost completely under Bullingbrook&#8217;s control, Aumerle attempts to rally the King and give him some hope. He later counsels the King against fighting to the death. He attempts to bluster his way out of being found guilty of his uncle Gloucester&#8217;s murder, and later joins a conspiracy to kill Bullingbrook after the latter has become King Henry IV. He quickly repents when he is found out, and his mother&#8217;s entreaties save his life. He is not the most intelligent of men, nor the most honorable; arguably he is completely out of his depth in the court.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="MOW.">Thomas Mowbray</persname>
<persdescription>Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk, is accused by Bullingbrook of having been responsible for the murder of the Duke of Gloucester, as well as of corruption on a grand scale. He forcefully denies all these charges; he also cannot bear to retract his own accusations against Bullingbrook, for fear of losing his honor by taking back what he has said. He sets great store by royal blood, and is cautious in his counter-accusations until reassured by Richard that Bullingbrook&#8217;s nobility will not be weighed in the matter of their quarrel. Deeply attached to England, he is distraught at being exiled. Though he denies having been a traitor to the last, in his exile he goes on crusade, often a way of atoning for sins. He is forty years old.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="SURREY.">Duke of Surrey</persname>
<persdescription>Surrey is an English nobleman who swears that Fitzwater is lying about what Aumerle said concerning the Duke of Gloucester&#8217;s death. He is an older man.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="SAL.">Earl of Salisbury</persname>
<persdescription>Salisbury is an English earl loyal to Richard. He attempts to keep a large Welsh force together to help Richard defeat Bullingbrook, but the King&#8217;s late arrival from Ireland prevents this. He is downcast at the mere one-day delay that could have saved the King. He is later executed by Henry IV&#8217;s men under Northumberland&#8217;s command.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="BERK.">Lord Berkeley</persname>
<persdescription>Berkeley is an English lord serving the Duke of York. He is careful not to get overly involved in the politics of the moment.</persdescription>

<persname short="BUSHY.">Sir John Bushy</persname>
<persaliases>
	<persname short="ALL. GREEN. AND BAGOT. AND AUM. AND BUSHY.">All Green, Bagot, Aumerle and Bushy</persname>
</persaliases>
<persdescription>John Bushy is one of Richard&#8217;s friends, deeply disliked by the nobility for being a commoner and having the King&#8217;s ear. A well-spoken flatterer, he attempts to cheer up the Queen after Richard leaves for Ireland. He grasps immediately that there is little hope of military victory against the returned Bullingbrook. He is executed by the latter on a variety of charges.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="BAGOT.">Sir John Bagot</persname>
<persaliases>
	<persname short="ALL. GREEN. AND BAGOT. AND AUM. AND BUSHY.">All Green, Bagot, Aumerle and Bushy</persname>
</persaliases>
<persdescription>John Bagot is one of Richard&#8217;s friends, deeply disliked by the nobility for being a commoner and having the King&#8217;s ear. He is perfectly aware that the common people are not overfond of Richard due to his heavy taxation. Rather than join Bushy and Green in hiding at the Earl of Wiltshire&#8217;s when Bullingbrook returns, he chooses to go to Ireland to warn the King. Captured by Bullingbrook, he accuses Aumerle of the Duke of Gloucester&#8217;s death, apparently saving himself by turning state&#8217;s evidence for the new King.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="GREEN.">Sir Henry Green</persname>
<persaliases>
	<persname short="ALL. GREEN. AND BAGOT. AND AUM. AND BUSHY.">All Green, Bagot, Aumerle and Bushy</persname>
</persaliases>
<persdescription>Henry Green is one of Richard&#8217;s friends, deeply disliked by the nobility for being a commoner and having the King&#8217;s ear. He convinces Richard of the necessity of going to war in Ireland, but hearing of Bullingbrook&#8217;s return rushes to tell the King not to leave. However, he arrives too late. He is aware that only Richard&#8217;s love keeps him and his other friends safe. He is put to death by Bullingbrook on a variety of charges.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="NORTH.">Earl of Northumberland</persname>
<persdescription>The Earl of Northumberland is an English nobleman with little love for Richard. When the King leaves for Ireland, Northumberland draws most of the rest of the nobility into a conspiracy against him to help Bullingbrook return. He quickly becomes Bullingbrook&#8217;s second-in-command and hatchet-man, and is the first to begin to regard Richard as deposed. He is a prosaic man, though he manages to entice Richard to leave the security of Flint Castle, and insists that Richard&#8217;s deposing be carried through to the letter as the Commons insist, including forcing Richard to agree that he has done wrong and is therefore justly overthrown. He is quite unsentimental, quick to cease speaking respectfully to the deposed King and to force him and his Queen to part, not to mention arrest the Bishop of Carlisle. He is generally in charge of executions for Henry IV. His further adventures can be found in <persnameref>Henry IV, Part One</persnameref>.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="PERCY.">Henry Percy</persname>
<persdescription>Harry/Henry Percy is Northumberland&#8217;s son. Quick to join the rebellion in his father&#8217;s wake, he is a good soldier, often used as a scout to discover the strength of castles that might resist. He is willing to swear to Fitzwalter&#8217;s good faith and honor, and is capable of tracking down Bullingbrook&#8217;s wild son. His further adventures are chronicled in <persnameref>Henry IV, Part One</persnameref>.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="ROSS.">Lord Ross</persname>
<persdescription>Ross is a nobleman greatly dissatisfied with Richard&#8217;s rule and over-taxation. Afraid of what might come next, he is quickly won over to Bullingbrook&#8217;s rebellion by Northumberland.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="WILLO.">Lord Willoughby</persname>
<persdescription>Willoughby is an English nobleman quick to listen to plans in Bullingbrook&#8217;s favor, being exasperated by Richard&#8217;s bad rule and the fear of what new exactions he may come up with. He is particularly unhappy that Richard has raised up commoners like Bushy and Green and allowed them to act like noblemen.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="FITZ.">Lord Fitzwater</persname>
<persdescription>Fitzwater is a young English nobleman who swears that he heard Aumerle boast of being responsible for the death of the Duke of Gloucester. He is hot-blooded and ready to fight for his cause. Whether or not he is correct is never resolved.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="CAR.">Bishop of Carlisle</persname>
<persdescription>The Bishop of Carlisle is loyal to Richard out of principle. With the courage of his convictions, he publically speaks up against Bullingbrook&#8217;s taking the throne at the moment the man announces that he will do so. Along with his arguments about the illegality of usurpation, he predicts the whole of the Wars of the Roses (which are explored in Henry IV, Parts One and Two, Henry V, Henry VI, Parts One, Two and Three, and Richard III). He is immediately arrested for doing so. Luckily for him, he is committed to the care of the Abbot of Westminster, who quite agrees with him, and invites him to supper. He is a brave man, quite willing to fight if need be. King Henry leaves him free if he will swear to remain peaceful.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="ABBOT.">Abbot of Westminster</persname>
<persdescription>Abbot of Westminster is grieved at Richard&#8217;s deposition. Agreeing with the Bishop of Carlisle&#8217;s denunciation of its illegality, he forms a plot to assassinate the new King Henry. This fails when Aumerle, who is in on the conspiracy, accidentally lets his father see a letter on the subject, causing the whole plot to be revealed. The Abbot is executed for this.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="MAR.">Lord Marshal</persname>
<persdescription>Lord Marshal is an official at the English court, whose job includes the regulating of tournaments and official duels. He is charged with making certain that all actions in a joust are carried out according to the rules. His role is comparable to that of the referee in a sports game, only with much greater importance, seeing as men will die in these games. He is a friend of Bullingbrook&#8217;s, and insists on accompanying him as far as he can when the latter is banished.</persdescription>

<persname short="SCROOP.">Sir Stephen Scroop</persname>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="EXTON.">Sir Pierce of Exton</persname>
<persdescription>Exton is an English knight who is convinced that Henry IV has surreptitiously given him orders to do away with Richard. Certain that acting on his interpretation of Henry&#8217;s words will do him a world of good, he takes his men to kill Richard. The sole survivor, he is left feeling that he has done something wrong. He is shocked when Henry disavows him and his action.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="CAP.">Welsh Captain</persname>
<persdescription>The Welsh Captain is in charge of an army of Welsh soldiers loyal to King Richard. When the latter does not return from Ireland as expected and his soldiers begin muttering that he is dead, he refuses to stay any longer by Salisbury&#8217;s side, seeing as his men will not. His action dooms the King, as Richard returns to England the day after he and his troops leave. He is superstitious.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="female">
<persname short="QUEEN.">Queen to King Richard</persname>
<persdescription>The Queen is Richard&#8217;s wife, a French princess. She is devoted to her husband, but has a great feeling of foreboding at his departure for Ireland. She is kept entirely out of the loop of politics, and only finds out about Richard&#8217;s capture when she overhears her gardener talking. She is generally melancholy, though this is mostly in reaction to events. The only action she takes of her own accord is going to see her husband as he is led to prison. She is disconcerted by Richard&#8217;s loss of poise, and disheartened by Northumberland&#8217;s refusal to let her join her husband in prison. She leaves for exile in France in despair.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="female">
<persname short="DUCH. YORK.">Duchess of York</persname>
<persdescription>The Duchess of York feels a great deal of pity for her nephew Richard after he is deposed and paraded through the streets. Past childbearing age, she is aghast at the idea that her husband would betray their son and send him to his death when the latter joins a treasonous plot. Out of love for her son she is willing to humiliate herself before her nephew. She does not think much of her husband.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="female">
<persname short="DUCH.">Duchess of Gloucester</persname>
<persdescription>The Duchess of Gloucester is the widow of the Duke of Gloucester, one of Richard&#8217;s uncles, who was murdered under mysterious circumstances &#8212; most likely at the King&#8217;s orders. She unsuccessfully attempts to convince her brother-in-law, John of Gaunt, to look into his brother&#8217;s death, and is distraught at his refusal. She is convinced of Mowbray&#8217;s guilt in her husband&#8217;s murder. She is friendly with her other brother-in-law, York.</persdescription>

<scenepersonae>(King Richard, John of Gaunt, Nobles, Attendants, Bullingbrook, Mowbray)</scenepersonae>
<scenedescription>King Richard calls on his uncle, John of Gaunt, to bring in his son Henry Bullingbrook, along with Thomas Mowbray so that the latter two can have their quarrel out in public. Bullingbrook accuses Mowbray of embezzlement and treasonous plotting, which Mowbray stoutly denies; finally, Bullingbrook charges Mowbray with the murder of the King&#8217;s uncle, the Duke of Gloucester. They challenge each other to a duel to determine the truth. Richard (who is not guiltless of Gloucester&#8217;s death), tries to pacify the two men, as does Gaunt, but neither of them is willing to appear a coward by taking back his challenge, and Richard is forced to set a date for the two to meet in combat.</scenedescription>

They prepare with great formality, but just as they are about to attack, Richard intervenes and stops them. The King calls his nobles to him, and announces his decision to exile both Bullingbrook and Mowbray, the one for ten years, the other for life, giving as pretext the fear that their dissention could cause civil war. Mowbray protests, but Richard is inflexible. He has both enemies swear an oath never to see each other in their exile. They do so, and Mowbray departs. For Gaunt&#8217;s sake, Richard shortens the term of Bullingbrook&#8217;s banishment to six years, but the aged Gaunt knows that he will never see his son again.

<scenedescription>The dying Gaunt despairingly talks with his brother York. Gaunt hopes that the fact he is dying may make his counsels to the King have some weight, but York thinks there is little likelihood of that. The King and his court enter, and Gaunt tries to reason with his nephew, but to no avail. His advice merely sends Richard into a rage, swearing that he would have Gaunt executed were it not that he not his uncle. Gaunt responds that he clearly has no respect for that fact, seeing as he killed his uncle Gloucester, and is carried away to die. Once his death is confirmed, Richard immediately announces his intention of confiscating the entirety of Gaunt&#8217;s possessions. York objects on the grounds that this is Bullingbrook&#8217;s inheritance, but Richard dismisses all argument, not caring whether his actions are legal or not. Richard creates York Governor of England during his absence in Ireland and leaves. Northumberland, Ross and Willoughby, remaining behind, discuss this latest injustice and Richard&#8217;s general tyranny. Northumberland discloses that Bullingbrook and other exiles are planning to return at the head of an army, and are only waiting for Richard&#8217;s departure. Ross and Willoughby immediately opt to join in the rebellion.</scenedescription>

<scenepersonae>(Queen, Bushy, Bagot, Green, York, Servingman)</scenepersonae>
<scenedescription>The Queen is uneasy, despite Bushy&#8217;s attempts to cheer her up, and expresses her vague fears to him. Green arrives, looking for the King, only to be told that Richard and his army have left for Ireland. Green explains that Bullingbrook has returned to England at the head of an army and that most of the powerful nobles have joined with him. York enters, prepared to do battle, but he is fully aware that he has almost nothing with which to oppose the rebels and that the commons are quite likely to join with Bullingbrook. Confused and out of his depth, he goes off to do what he can, taking the Queen with him for her safety. Bushy, Bagot and Green, aware of how much they are hated by the people, make plans for their safety; Bagot chooses to go join Richard in Ireland, while the other two will seek safety at the Earl of Wiltshire&#8217;s castle.</scenedescription>

<scenedescription>Bullingbrook and his forces trudge through Gloucestershire, not knowing the way, but are cheered as various nobles come to join them and they learn just how widespread disaffection with Richard is. They arrive at Berkeley, where York upbraids Bullingbrook for daring to return to England when he has been exiled. Bullingbrook answers that it was the Duke of Hereford who was banished, but that since Gaunt&#8217;s death he has been Duke of Lancaster, and was never exiled under that title. He is supported by the other lords, who complain of Richard&#8217;s tyranny. York admits Richard has not been the best of kings, and that Bullingbrook has some rights on his side, but still considers them rebels. However, since it is also clear that he cannot defeat them in battle, he announces his decision to be neutral. Bullingbrook insists that York accompany him to rid the country of Bushy, Bagot, and the others. York is noncommittal.</scenedescription>

Richard is shaken, but tries to reassure himself with the thought of the power of the King&#8217;s name, and the forces that York will have gathered. But Scroop joins the royal party and tells him that the entire island is rising in stark opposition to the King, and that Bushy, Bagot and Wiltshire have been executed. Richard realizes that his reign is over, and that he is likely to be killed. The Cardinal and Aumerle stiffen his spine, and he again rouses himself, thinking of York&#8217;s army, but his hopes are dashed when Scroop has to report that York has joined the rebels as well. Richard despairs; refusing to be comforted, he decides to go to Flint Castle, there to wait for events, and has his men dismissed.</scenedescription>

<scenedescription>Bullingbrook learns that Richard is defenseless at Flint Castle and that all of his followers have fled. York is becoming suspicious of his nephew&#8217;s intentions, and warns him not to go too far. Bullingbrook insists that he has only returned for the sake of the lands that Richard confiscated on Gaunt&#8217;s death, and to have his banishment repealed. He sends a message to the King asking for this, threatening otherwise to use his army. Richard appears majestically on the walls of the castle to answer, and the rebels are impressed despite themselves. The King agrees to speak with Bullingbrook, and to himself laments ever having banished him. Knowing there is no other option, he resigns himself to placing himself in Bullingbrook&#8217;s power. He leaves the castle, and agrees to follow Bullingbrook wherever he wishes.</scenedescription>

<scenedescription>Bullingbrook interrogates Bagot about the death of the Duke of Gloucester, and Bagot accuses York&#8217;s son Aumerle of the deed. Aumerle denies it and challenges Bagot to a duel, but Bullingbrook refuses to let Bagot accept. Fitzwalter, Percy and another lord all challenge Aumerle as well, though Surrey accuses Fitzwalter of lying. There is great confusion until Bullingbrook silences them, putting the question aside until he can have Mowbray return to tell his tale. But Mowbray, it turns out, is dead. Bullingbrook puts the whole affair off until he can try Aumerle. York enters to announce that Richard has named Bullingbrook his heir and resigned the throne, and acclaims Bullingbrook as Henry IV. The Bishop of Carlisle protests against this, and is arrested for high treason. Richard is sent for to abdicate publically. He is torn and almost cannot bring himself to do it, but in the end he hands his crown over to Henry. He is then ordered to read a list of the accusations against him. He tries not to, and asks for a mirror so he can see whether there are any traces of the change in his status on his face. He can find none. He asks for permission to leave, and is sent to the Tower. Aumerle, Carlisle and Westminster plot against Henry.</scenedescription>

<scenedescription>King Henry asks if anyone has news of his son, who&#8217;s leading a wild life in the city. The news he does get is not reassuring. Aumerle arrives and begs to speak to the King alone; as he is about to confess to his treason, York arrives to accuse his son and asks Henry to have Aumerle sentenced. But the Duchess arrives to plead for Aumerle&#8217;s life. In the end, Henry agrees to pardon his cousin, but insists that he will have all the other members of the plot executed.</scenedescription>

<line form="verse">I have been studying how I may compare</line>
<line form="verse">This prison where I live unto the world;</line>
<line form="verse">And for because the world is populous,</line>
<line form="verse">And here is not a creature but myself,</line>
<line form="verse">I cannot do it; yet I&#8217;ll hammer it out.</line>
<line form="verse">My brain I&#8217;ll prove the female to my soul,</line>
<line form="verse">My soul the father, and these two beget</line>
<line form="verse">A generation of still-breeding thoughts;</line>
<line form="verse">And these some thoughts people this little world,</line>
<line form="verse">In humors like the people of this world:</line>
<line form="verse">For no thought is contented. The better sort,</line>
<line form="verse">As thoughts of things divine, are intermix&#8217;d</line>
<line form="verse">With scruples and do set the word itself</line>
<line form="verse">Against the word,</line>
<line form="verse">As thus: &#8220;Come, little ones,&#8221; and then again,</line>
<line form="verse">&#8220;It is as hard to come as for a camel</line>
<line form="verse">To thread the postern of a small needle&#8217;s eye.&#8221;</line>
<line form="verse">Thoughts tending to ambition, they do plot</line>
<line form="verse">Unlikely wonders: how these vain weak nails</line>
<line form="verse">May tear a passage thorough the flinty ribs</line>
<line form="verse">Of this hard world, my ragged prison walls;</line>
<line form="verse">And for they cannot, die in their own pride.</line>
<line form="verse">Thoughts tending to content flatter themselves</line>
<line form="verse">That they are not the first of fortune&#8217;s slaves,</line>
<line form="verse">Nor shall not be the last&#8212;like seely beggars</line>
<line form="verse">Who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame,</line>

<line form="verse">Persuades me I was better when a king;</line>

<line form="verse">Think that I am unking&#8217;d by Bullingbrook,</line>
