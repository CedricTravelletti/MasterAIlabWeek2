<stagedir>Enter King Richard, John of Gaunt, with other Nobles and Attendants.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line>Old John of Gaunt, time-honored Lancaster,</line>
<line>Hast thou, according to thy oath and band,</line>
<line>Brought hither Henry Herford thy bold son,</line>
<line>Here to make good the boist&#8217;rous late appeal,</line>
<line>Which then our leisure would not let us hear,</line>
<line>Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GAUNT.</speaker>
<line>I have, my liege.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line>Tell me, moreover, hast thou sounded him,</line>
<line>If he appeal the Duke on ancient malice,</line>
<line>Or worthily, as a good subject should,</line>
<line>On some known ground of treachery in him?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GAUNT.</speaker>
<line>As near as I could sift him on that argument,</line>
<line>On some apparent danger seen in him</line>
<line>Aim&#8217;d at your Highness, no inveterate malice.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line>Then call them to our presence; face to face,</line>
<line>And frowning brow to brow, ourselves will hear</line>
<line>The accuser and the accused freely speak.</line>
<line>High-stomach&#8217;d are they both and full of ire,</line>
<line>In rage, deaf as the sea, hasty as fire.</line>
</speech>
<stagedir>Enter Bullingbrook and Mowbray with Attendants.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>BULL.</speaker>
<line>Many years of happy days befall</line>
<line>My gracious sovereign, my most loving liege!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MOW.</speaker>
<line>Each day still better other&#8217;s happiness,</line>
<line>Until the heavens, envying earth&#8217;s good hap,</line>
<line>Add an immortal title to your crown!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line>We thank you both, yet one but flatters us,</line>
<line>As well appeareth by the cause you come:</line>
<line>Namely, to appeal each other of high treason.</line>
<line>Cousin of Herford, what dost thou object</line>
<line>Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BULL.</speaker>
<line>First, heaven be the record to my speech,</line>
<line>In the devotion of a subject&#8217;s love,</line>
<line>Tend&#8217;ring the precious safety of my prince,</line>
<line>And free from other misbegotten hate,</line>
<line>Come I appellant to this princely presence.</line>
<line>Now, Thomas Mowbray, do I turn to thee,</line>
<line>And mark my greeting well; for what I speak</line>
<line>My body shall make good upon this earth,</line>
<line>Or my divine soul answer it in heaven.</line>
<line>Thou art a traitor and a miscreant,</line>
<line>Too good to be so, and too bad to live,</line>
<line>Since the more fair and crystal is the sky,</line>
<line>The uglier seem the clouds that in it fly.</line>
<line>Once more, the more to aggravate the note,</line>
<line>With a foul traitor&#8217;s name stuff I thy throat,</line>
<line>And wish (so please my sovereign) ere I move,</line>
<line>What my tongue speaks, my right drawn sword may prove.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MOW.</speaker>
<line>Let not my cold words here accuse my zeal.</line>
<line>&#8217;Tis not the trial of a woman&#8217;s war,</line>
<line>The bitter clamor of two eager tongues,</line>
<line>Can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain;</line>
<line>The blood is hot that must be cool&#8217;d for this.</line>
<line>Yet can I not of such tame patience boast</line>
<line>As to be hush&#8217;d and nought at all to say.</line>
<line>First, the fair reverence of your Highness curbs me</line>
<line>From giving reins and spurs to my free speech,</line>
<line>Which else would post until it had return&#8217;d</line>
<line>These terms of treason doubled down his throat.</line>
<line>Setting aside his high blood&#8217;s royalty,</line>
<line>And let him be no kinsman to my liege,</line>
<line>I do defy him, and I spit at him,</line>
<line>Call him a slanderous coward, and a villain,</line>
<line>Which to maintain I would allow him odds</line>
<line>And meet him, were I tied to run afoot</line>
<line>Even to the frozen ridges of the Alps,</line>
<line>Or any other ground inhabitable</line>
<line>Where ever Englishman durst set his foot.</line>
<line>Mean time, let this defend my loyalty:</line>
<line>By all my hopes, most falsely doth he lie.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BULL.</speaker>
<line>Pale trembling coward, there I throw my gage,</line>
<line>Disclaiming here the kinred of the King,</line>
<line>And lay aside my high blood&#8217;s royalty,</line>
<line>Which fear, not reverence, makes thee to except.</line>
<line>If guilty dread have left thee so much strength</line>
<line>As to take up mine honor&#8217;s pawn, then stoop.</line>
<line>By that, and all the rites of knighthood else,</line>
<line>Will I make good against thee, arm to arm,</line>
<line>What I have spoke, or thou canst worse devise.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MOW.</speaker>
<line>I take it up, and by that sword I swear</line>
<line>Which gently laid my knighthood on my shoulder,</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll answer thee in any fair degree</line>
<line>Or chivalrous design of knightly trial;</line>
<line>And when I mount, alive may I not light,</line>
<line>If I be traitor or unjustly fight!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line>What doth our cousin lay to Mowbray&#8217;s charge?</line>
<line>It must be great that can inherit us</line>
<line>So much as of a thought of ill in him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BULL.</speaker>
<line>Look what I speak, my life shall prove it true:</line>
<line>That Mowbray hath receiv&#8217;d eight thousand nobles</line>
<line>In name of lendings for your Highness&#8217; soldiers,</line>
<line>The which he hath detain&#8217;d for lewd employments,</line>
<line>Like a false traitor and injurious villain;</line>
<line>Besides I say, and will in battle prove,</line>
<line>Or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge</line>
<line>That ever was surveyed by English eye,</line>
<line>That all the treasons for these eighteen years,</line>
<line>Complotted and contrived in this land,</line>
<line>Fetch from false Mowbray their first head and spring.</line>
<line>Further I say, and further will maintain</line>
<line>Upon his bad life to make all this good,</line>
<line>That he did plot the Duke of Gloucester&#8217;s death,</line>
<line>Suggest his soon-believing adversaries,</line>
<line>And consequently, like a traitor coward,</line>
<line>Sluic&#8217;d out his innocent soul through streams of blood,</line>
<line>Which blood, like sacrificing Abel&#8217;s, cries,</line>
<line>Even from the tongueless caverns of the earth,</line>
<line>To me for justice and rough chastisement;</line>
<line>And, by the glorious worth of my descent,</line>
<line>This arm shall do it, or this life be spent.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line>How high a pitch his resolution soars!</line>
<line>Thomas of Norfolk, what say&#8217;st thou to this?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MOW.</speaker>
<line>O, let my sovereign turn away his face,</line>
<line>And bid his ears a little while be deaf,</line>
<line>Till I have told this slander of his blood</line>
<line>How God and good men hate so foul a liar.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line>Mowbray, impartial are our eyes and ears.</line>
<line>Were he my brother, nay, my kingdom&#8217;s heir,</line>
<line>As he is but my father&#8217;s brother&#8217;s son,</line>
<line>Now by my sceptre&#8217;s awe I make a vow,</line>
<line>Such neighbor nearness to our sacred blood</line>
<line>Should nothing privilege him nor partialize</line>
<line>The unstooping firmness of my upright soul.</line>
<line>He is our subject, Mowbray; so art thou.</line>
<line>Free speech and fearless I to thee allow.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MOW.</speaker>
<line>Then, Bullingbrook, as low as to thy heart</line>
<line>Through the false passage of thy throat thou liest.</line>
<line>Three parts of that receipt I had for Callice</line>
<line>Disburs&#8217;d I duly to his Highness&#8217; soldiers;</line>
<line>The other part reserv&#8217;d I by consent,</line>
<line>For that my sovereign liege was in my debt,</line>
<line>Upon remainder of a dear account,</line>
<line>Since last I went to France to fetch his queen.</line>
<line>Now swallow down that lie. For Gloucester&#8217;s death,</line>
<line>I slew him not, but to my own disgrace</line>
<line>Neglected my sworn duty in that case.</line>
<line>For you, my noble Lord of Lancaster,</line>
<line>The honorable father to my foe,</line>
<line>Once did I lay an ambush for your life,</line>
<line>A trespass that doth vex my grieved soul;</line>
<line>But ere I last receiv&#8217;d the sacrament</line>
<line>I did confess it, and exactly begg&#8217;d</line>
<line>Your Grace&#8217;s pardon, and I hope I had it.</line>
<line>This is my fault. As for the rest appeal&#8217;d,</line>
<line>It issues from the rancor of a villain,</line>
<line>A recreant and most degenerate traitor,</line>
<line>Which in myself I boldly will defend,</line>
<line>And interchangeably hurl down my gage</line>
<line>Upon this overweening traitor&#8217;s foot,</line>
<line>To prove myself a loyal gentleman</line>
<line>Even in the best blood chamber&#8217;d in his bosom,</line>
<line>In haste whereof, most heartily I pray</line>
<line>Your Highness to assign our trial day.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line>Wrath-kindled gentlemen, be rul&#8217;d by me,</line>
<line>Let&#8217;s purge this choler without letting blood.</line>
<line>This we prescribe, though no physician;</line>
<line>Deep malice makes too deep incision.</line>
<line>Forget, forgive, conclude and be agreed,</line>
<line>Our doctors say this is no month to bleed.</line>
<line>Good uncle, let this end where it begun;</line>
<line>We&#8217;ll calm the Duke of Norfolk, you your son.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GAUNT.</speaker>
<line>To be a make-peace shall become my age.</line>
<line>Throw down, my son, the Duke of Norfolk&#8217;s gage.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line>And, Norfolk, throw down his.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GAUNT.</speaker>
<line offset="7">When, Harry? When?</line>
<line>Obedience bids I should not bid again.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line>Norfolk, throw down, we bid, there is no boot.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MOW.</speaker>
<line>Myself I throw, dread sovereign, at thy foot,</line>
<line>My life thou shalt command, but not my shame:</line>
<line>The one my duty owes, but my fair name,</line>
<line>Despite of death that lives upon my grave,</line>
<line>To dark dishonor&#8217;s use thou shalt not have.</line>
<line>I am disgrac&#8217;d, impeach&#8217;d, and baffled here,</line>
<line>Pierc&#8217;d to the soul with slander&#8217;s venom&#8217;d spear,</line>
<line>The which no balm can cure but his heart-blood</line>
<line>Which breath&#8217;d this poison.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Rage must be withstood,</line>
<line>Give me his gage. Lions make leopards tame.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MOW.</speaker>
<line>Yea, but not change his spots. Take but my shame,</line>
<line>And I resign my gage. My dear dear lord,</line>
<line>The purest treasure mortal times afford</line>
<line>Is spotless reputation; that away,</line>
<line>Men are but gilded loam or painted clay.</line>
<line>A jewel in a ten-times-barr&#8217;d-up chest</line>
<line>Is a bold spirit in a loyal breast.</line>
<line>Mine honor is my life, both grow in one,</line>
<line>Take honor from me, and my life is done.</line>
<line>Then, dear my liege, mine honor let me try;</line>
<line>In that I live, and for that will I die.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line>Cousin, throw up your gage, do you begin.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BULL.</speaker>
<line>O, God defend my soul from such deep sin!</line>
<line>Shall I seem crestfallen in my father&#8217;s sight?</line>
<line>Or with pale beggar-fear impeach my height</line>
<line>Before this outdar&#8217;d dastard? Ere my tongue</line>
<line>Shall wound my honor with such feeble wrong,</line>
<line>Or sound so base a parley, my teeth shall tear</line>
<line>The slavish motive of recanting fear,</line>
<line>And spit it bleeding in his high disgrace,</line>
<line>Where shame doth harbor, even in Mowbray&#8217;s face.</line>
</speech>
<stagedir>Exit Gaunt.</stagedir>


<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line>We were not born to sue, but to command,</line>
<line>Which since we cannot do to make you friends,</line>
<line>Be ready, as your lives shall answer it,</line>
<line>At Coventry upon Saint Lambert&#8217;s day.</line>
<line>There shall your swords and lances arbitrate</line>
<line>The swelling difference of your settled hate.</line>
<line>Since we cannot atone you, we shall see</line>
<line>Justice design the victor&#8217;s chivalry.</line>
<line>Lord Marshal, command our officers-at-arms</line>
<line>Be ready to direct these home alarms.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>GAUNT.</speaker>
<line>Alas, the part I had in Woodstock&#8217;s blood</line>
<line>Doth more solicit me than your exclaims</line>
<line>To stir against the butchers of his life!</line>
<line>But since correction lieth in those hands</line>
<line>Which made the fault that we cannot correct,</line>
<line>Put we our quarrel to the will of heaven,</line>
<line>Who, when they see the hour&#8217;s ripe on earth,</line>
<line>Will rain hot vengeance on offenders&#8217; heads.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUCH.</speaker>
<line>Finds brotherhood in thee no sharper spur?</line>
<line>Hath love in thy old blood no living fire?</line>
<line>Edward&#8217;s seven sons, whereof thyself art one,</line>
<line>Were as seven vials of his sacred blood,</line>
<line>Or seven fair branches springing from one root.</line>
<line>Some of those seven are dried by nature&#8217;s course,</line>
<line>Some of those branches by the Destinies cut;</line>
<line>But Thomas, my dear lord, my life, my Gloucester,</line>
<line>One vial full of Edward&#8217;s sacred blood,</line>
<line>One flourishing branch of his most royal root,</line>
<line>Is crack&#8217;d, and all the precious liquor spilt,</line>
<line>Is hack&#8217;d down, and his summer leaves all faded,</line>
<line>By envy&#8217;s hand and murder&#8217;s bloody axe.</line>
<line>Ah, Gaunt, his blood was thine! That bed, that womb,</line>
<line>That mettle, that self mould, that fashioned thee</line>
<line>Made him a man; and though thou livest and breathest,</line>
<line>Yet art thou slain in him. Thou dost consent</line>
<line>In some large measure to thy father&#8217;s death,</line>
<line>In that thou seest thy wretched brother die,</line>
<line>Who was the model of thy father&#8217;s life.</line>
<line>Call it not patience, Gaunt, it is despair.</line>
<line>In suff&#8217;ring thus thy brother to be slaught&#8217;red,</line>
<line>Thou showest the naked pathway to thy life,</line>
<line>Teaching stern murder how to butcher thee.</line>
<line>That which in mean men we entitle patience</line>
<line>Is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts.</line>
<line>What shall I say? To safeguard thine own life</line>
<line>The best way is to venge my Gloucester&#8217;s death.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GAUNT.</speaker>
<line>God&#8217;s is the quarrel, for God&#8217;s substitute,</line>
<line>His deputy anointed in His sight,</line>
<line>Hath caus&#8217;d his death, the which if wrongfully,</line>
<line>Let heaven revenge, for I may never lift</line>
<line>An angry arm against His minister.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUCH.</speaker>
<line>Where then, alas, may I complain myself?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GAUNT.</speaker>
<line>To God, the widow&#8217;s champion and defense.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUCH.</speaker>
<line>Why then I will. Farewell, old Gaunt!</line>
<line>Thou goest to Coventry, there to behold</line>
<line>Our cousin Herford and fell Mowbray fight.</line>
<line>O, sit my husband&#8217;s wrongs on Herford&#8217;s spear,</line>
<line>That it may enter butcher Mowbray&#8217;s breast!</line>
<line>Or if misfortune miss the first career,</line>
<line>Be Mowbray&#8217;s sins so heavy in his bosom</line>
<line>That they may break his foaming courser&#8217;s back,</line>
<line>And throw the rider headlong in the lists,</line>
<line>A caitive recreant to my cousin Herford!</line>
<line>Farewell, old Gaunt! Thy sometimes brother&#8217;s wife</line>
<line>With her companion, grief, must end her life.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GAUNT.</speaker>
<line>Sister, farewell, I must to Coventry.</line>
<line>As much good stay with thee as go with me!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUCH.</speaker>
<line>Yet one word more! Grief boundeth where it falls,</line>
<line>Not with the empty hollowness, but weight.</line>
<line>I take my leave before I have begun,</line>
<line>For sorrow ends not when it seemeth done.</line>
<line>Commend me to thy brother, Edmund York.</line>
<line>Lo this is all&#8212;nay, yet depart not so;</line>
<line>Though this be all, do not so quickly go;</line>
<line>I shall remember more. Bid him&#8212;ah, what?&#8212;</line>
<line>With all good speed at Plashy visit me.</line>
<line>Alack, and what shall good old York there see</line>
<line>But empty lodgings and unfurnish&#8217;d walls,</line>
<line>Unpeopled offices, untrodden stones?</line>
<line>And what hear there for welcome but my groans?</line>
<line>Therefore commend me; let him not come there</line>
<line>To seek out sorrow that dwells every where.</line>
<line>Desolate, desolate, will I hence and die:</line>
<line>The last leave of thee takes my weeping eye.</line>

<line>The daintiest last, to make the end most sweet:</line>
<line>O thou, the earthly author of my blood,</line>
<line>Whose youthful spirit, in me regenerate,</line>
<line>Doth with a twofold vigor lift me up</line>
<line>To reach at victory above my head,</line>
<line>Add proof unto mine armor with thy prayers,</line>
<line>And with thy blessings steel my lance&#8217;s point,</line>
<line>That it may enter Mowbray&#8217;s waxen coat,</line>
<line>And furbish new the name of John a&#8217; Gaunt,</line>
<line>Even in the lusty havior of his son.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>GAUNT.</speaker>
<line>God in thy good cause make thee prosperous!</line>
<line>Be swift like lightning in the execution,</line>

<line>Of thy adverse pernicious enemy.</line>

<line>A loyal, just, and upright gentleman.</line>
<line>Never did captive with a freer heart</line>
<line>Cast off his chains of bondage, and embrace</line>
<line>His golden uncontroll&#8217;d enfranchisement,</line>
<line>More than my dancing soul doth celebrate</line>
<line>This feast of battle with mine adversary.</line>
<line>Most mighty liege, and my companion peers,</line>

<speaker>1. HER.</speaker>
<line>Harry of Herford, Lancaster, and Derby</line>
<line>Stands here for God, his sovereign, and himself,</line>
<line>On pain to be found false and recreant,</line>
<line>To prove the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray,</line>
<line>A traitor to his God, his king, and him,</line>
<line>And dares him to set forward to the fight.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. HER.</speaker>
<line>Here standeth Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk,</line>
<line>On pain to be found false and recreant,</line>
<line>Both to defend himself and to approve</line>
<line>Henry of Herford, Lancaster, and Derby</line>
<line>To God, his sovereign, and to him disloyal,</line>
<line>Courageously, and with a free desire,</line>
<line>Attending but the signal to begin.</line>

<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line>Let them lay by their helmets and their spears,</line>
<line>And both return back to their chairs again.</line>
<line>Withdraw with us, and let the trumpets sound</line>
<line>While we return these dukes what we decree.</line>


<stagedir>A long flourish.</stagedir>
<line>Draw near,</line>
<line>And list what with our Council we have done:</line>
<line>For that our kingdom&#8217;s earth should not be soil&#8217;d</line>
<line>With that dear blood which it hath fostered;</line>
<line>And for our eyes do hate the dire aspect</line>
<line>Of civil wounds plough&#8217;d up with neighbors&#8217; sword;</line>
<line>And for we think the eagle-winged pride</line>
<line>Of sky-aspiring and ambitious thoughts,</line>
<line>With rival-hating envy, set on you</line>
<line>To wake our peace, which in our country&#8217;s cradle</line>
<line>Draws the sweet infant breath of gentle sleep;</line>
<line>Which so rous&#8217;d up with boist&#8217;rous untun&#8217;d drums,</line>
<line>With harsh-resounding trumpets&#8217; dreadful bray,</line>
<line>And grating shock of wrathful iron arms,</line>
<line>Might from our quiet confines fright fair peace,</line>
<line>And make us wade even in our kinred&#8217;s blood:</line>
<line>Therefore we banish you our territories.</line>
<line>You, cousin Herford, upon pain of life,</line>
<line>Till twice five summers have enrich&#8217;d our fields</line>
<line>Shall not regreet our fair dominions,</line>
<line>But tread the stranger paths of banishment.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BULL.</speaker>
<line>Your will be done. This must my comfort be,</line>
<line>That sun that warms you here shall shine on me,</line>
<line>And those his golden beams to you here lent</line>
<line>Shall point on me and gild my banishment.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line>Norfolk, for thee remains a heavier doom,</line>
<line>Which I with same unwillingness pronounce:</line>
<line>The sly, slow hours shall not determinate</line>
<line>The dateless limit of thy dear exile;</line>
<line>The hopeless word of &#8220;never to return&#8221;</line>
<line>Breathe I against thee, upon pain of life.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MOW.</speaker>
<line>A heavy sentence, my most sovereign liege,</line>
<line>And all unlook&#8217;d for from your Highness&#8217; mouth.</line>
<line>A dearer merit, not so deep a maim</line>
<line>As to be cast forth in the common air,</line>
<line>Have I deserved at your Highness&#8217; hands.</line>
<line>The language I have learnt these forty years,</line>
<line>My native English, now I must forgo,</line>
<line>And now my tongue&#8217;s use is to me no more</line>
<line>Than an unstringed viol or a harp,</line>
<line>Or like a cunning instrument cas&#8217;d up,</line>
<line>Or being open, put into his hands</line>
<line>That knows no touch to tune the harmony.</line>
<line>Within my mouth you have enjail&#8217;d my tongue,</line>
<line>Doubly portcullis&#8217;d with my teeth and lips,</line>
<line>And dull unfeeling barren ignorance</line>
<line>Is made my jailer to attend on me.</line>
<line>I am too old to fawn upon a nurse,</line>
<line>Too far in years to be a pupil now.</line>
<line>What is thy sentence then but speechless death,</line>
<line>Which robs my tongue from breathing native breath?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line>It boots thee not to be compassionate,</line>
<line>After our sentence plaining comes too late.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MOW.</speaker>
<line>Then thus I turn me from my country&#8217;s light,</line>
<line>To dwell in solemn shades of endless night.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line>Return again, and take an oath with thee.</line>
<line>Lay on our royal sword your banish&#8217;d hands;</line>
<line>Swear by the duty that y&#8217; owe to God</line>
<line>(Our part therein we banish with yourselves)</line>
<line>To keep the oath that we administer:</line>

<line>Embrace each other&#8217;s love in banishment,</line>
<line>Nor never look upon each other&#8217;s face,</line>

<line>This low&#8217;ring tempest of your home-bred hate,</line>
<line>Nor never by advised purpose meet</line>

<line>&#8217;Gainst us, our state, our subjects, or our land.</line>
</speech>

<speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BULL.</speaker>
<line>Norfolk, so fare as to mine enemy:</line>
<line>By this time, had the King permitted us,</line>
<line>One of our souls had wand&#8217;red in the air,</line>
<line>Banish&#8217;d this frail sepulchre of our flesh,</line>
<line>As now our flesh is banish&#8217;d from this land;</line>
<line>Confess thy treasons ere thou fly the realm;</line>
<line>Since thou hast far to go, bear not along</line>
<line>The clogging burden of a guilty soul.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MOW.</speaker>
<line>No, Bullingbrook, if ever I were traitor,</line>
<line>My name be blotted from the book of life,</line>
<line>And I from heaven banish&#8217;d as from hence!</line>
<line>But what thou art, God, thou, and I do know,</line>
<line>And all too soon, I fear, the King shall rue.</line>
<line>Farewell, my liege, now no way can I stray;</line>
<line>Save back to England, all the world&#8217;s my way.</line>
</speech>
<stagedir>Exit.</stagedir>


<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line>Uncle, even in the glasses of thine eyes</line>
<line>I see thy grieved heart. Thy sad aspect</line>

<line>Pluck&#8217;d four away.</line>

<stagedir>To Bullingbrook.</stagedir>
<line offset="4">Six frozen winters spent,</line>

<speaker>BULL.</speaker>

<line>Four lagging winters and four wanton springs</line>
<line>End in a word: such is the breath of kings.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GAUNT.</speaker>
<line>I thank my liege that in regard of me</line>
<line>He shortens four years of my son&#8217;s exile,</line>
<line>But little vantage shall I reap thereby;</line>
<line>For ere the six years that he hath to spend</line>
<line>Can change their moons and bring their times about,</line>
<line>My oil-dried lamp and time-bewasted light</line>
<line>Shall be extinct with age and endless night;</line>
<line>My inch of taper will be burnt and done,</line>
<line>And blindfold Death not let me see my son.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line>Why, uncle, thou hast many years to live.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GAUNT.</speaker>
<line>But not a minute, King, that thou canst give.</line>
<line>Shorten my days thou canst with sullen sorrow,</line>
<line>And pluck nights from me, but not lend a morrow;</line>
<line>Thou canst help time to furrow me with age,</line>
<line>But stop no wrinkle in his pilgrimage;</line>
<line>Thy word is current with him for my death,</line>
<line>But dead, thy kingdom cannot buy my breath.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line>Thy son is banish&#8217;d upon good advice,</line>
<line>Whereto thy tongue a party-verdict gave.</line>
<line>Why at our justice seem&#8217;st thou then to low&#8217;r?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GAUNT.</speaker>
<line>Things sweet to taste prove in digestion sour.</line>
<line>You urg&#8217;d me as a judge, but I had rather</line>
<line>You would have bid me argue like a father.</line>
<line>O, had&#8217;t been a stranger, not my child,</line>
<line>To smooth his fault I should have been more mild.</line>
<line>A partial slander sought I to avoid,</line>
<line>And in the sentence my own life destroyed.</line>
<line>Alas, I look&#8217;d when some of you should say</line>
<line>I was too strict to make mine own away;</line>
<line>But you gave leave to my unwilling tongue</line>
<line>Against my will to do myself this wrong.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line>Cousin, farewell; and, uncle, bid him so.</line>
<line>Six years we banish him, and he shall go.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>MAR.</speaker>
<line>My lord, no leave take I, for I will ride,</line>
<line>As far as land will let me, by your side.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GAUNT.</speaker>
<line>O, to what purpose dost thou hoard thy words,</line>
<line>That thou returnest no greeting to thy friends?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BULL.</speaker>
<line>I have too few to take my leave of you,</line>
<line>When the tongue&#8217;s office should be prodigal</line>
<line>To breathe the abundant dolor of the heart.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GAUNT.</speaker>
<line>Thy grief is but thy absence for a time.</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GAUNT.</speaker>
<line>What is six winters? They are quickly gone.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BULL.</speaker>
<line>To men in joy, but grief makes one hour ten.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GAUNT.</speaker>
<line>Call it a travel that thou tak&#8217;st for pleasure.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BULL.</speaker>
<line>My heart will sigh when I miscall it so,</line>
<line>Which finds it an enforced pilgrimage.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GAUNT.</speaker>
<line>The sullen passage of thy weary steps</line>
<line>Esteem as foil wherein thou art to set</line>
<line>The precious jewel of thy home return.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BULL.</speaker>
<line>Nay rather, every tedious stride I make</line>
<line>Will but remember me what a deal of world</line>
<line>I wander from the jewels that I love.</line>
<line>Must I not serve a long apprenticehood</line>
<line>To foreign passages, and in the end,</line>
<line>Having my freedom, boast of nothing else</line>
<line>But that I was a journeyman to grief?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GAUNT.</speaker>
<line>All places that the eye of heaven visits</line>
<line>Are to a wise man ports and happy havens.</line>
<line>Teach thy necessity to reason thus:</line>
<line>There is no virtue like necessity.</line>
<line>Think not the King did banish thee,</line>
<line>But thou the King. Woe doth the heavier sit</line>
<line>Where it perceives it is but faintly borne.</line>
<line>Go, say I sent thee forth to purchase honor,</line>
<line>And not the King exil&#8217;d thee; or suppose</line>
<line>Devouring pestilence hangs in our air,</line>
<line>And thou art flying to a fresher clime.</line>
<line>Look what thy soul holds dear, imagine it</line>
<line>To lie that way thou goest, not whence thou com&#8217;st.</line>
<line>Suppose the singing birds musicians,</line>
<line>The grass whereon thou tread&#8217;st the presence strow&#8217;d,</line>
<line>The flowers fair ladies, and thy steps no more</line>
<line>Than a delightful measure or a dance,</line>
<line>For gnarling sorrow hath less power to bite</line>
<line>The man that mocks at it and sets it light.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BULL.</speaker>
<line>O, who can hold a fire in his hand</line>
<line>By thinking on the frosty Caucasus?</line>
<line>Or cloy the hungry edge of appetite</line>
<line>By bare imagination of a feast?</line>
<line>Or wallow naked in December snow</line>
<line>By thinking on fantastic summer&#8217;s heat?</line>
<line>O no, the apprehension of the good</line>
<line>Gives but the greater feeling to the worse.</line>
<line>Fell Sorrow&#8217;s tooth doth never rankle more</line>
<line>Than when he bites, but lanceth not the sore.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GAUNT.</speaker>
<line>Come, come, my son, I&#8217;ll bring thee on thy way;</line>
<line>Had I thy youth and cause, I would not stay.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BULL.</speaker>
<line>Then England&#8217;s ground, farewell, sweet soil, <french xml:lang="fr">adieu</french>;</line>

<line>Marry, would the word &#8220;farewell&#8221; have length&#8217;ned hours</line>

<line>What reverence he did throw away on slaves,</line>
<line>Wooing poor craftsmen with the craft of smiles</line>
<line>And patient underbearing of his fortune,</line>
<line>As &#8217;twere to banish their affects with him.</line>
<line>Off goes his bonnet to an oyster-wench,</line>

<line>This happy breed of men, this little world,</line>
<line>This precious stone set in the silver sea,</line>
<line>Which serves it in the office of a wall,</line>
<line>Or as a moat defensive to a house,</line>
<line>Against the envy of less happier lands;</line>
<line>This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England,</line>
<line>This nurse, this teeming womb of royal kings,</line>
<line>Fear&#8217;d by their breed, and famous by their birth,</line>
<line>Renowned for their deeds as far from home,</line>
<line>For Christian service and true chivalry,</line>
<line>As is the sepulchre in stubborn Jewry</line>
<line>Of the world&#8217;s ransom, blessed Mary&#8217;s Son;</line>
<line>This land of such dear souls, this dear dear land,</line>
<line>Dear for her reputation through the world,</line>
<line>Is now leas&#8217;d out&#8212;I die pronouncing it&#8212;</line>
<line>Like to a tenement or pelting farm.</line>
<line>England, bound in with the triumphant sea,</line>
<line>Whose rocky shore beats back the envious siege</line>
<line>Of wat&#8217;ry Neptune, is now bound in with shame,</line>
<line>With inky blots and rotten parchment bonds;</line>
<line>That England, that was wont to conquer others,</line>

<line>Ah, would the scandal vanish with my life,</line>

<line>What comfort, man? How is&#8217;t with aged Gaunt?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GAUNT.</speaker>
<line>O how that name befits my composition!</line>
<line>Old Gaunt indeed, and gaunt in being old.</line>
<line>Within me grief hath kept a tedious fast;</line>
<line>And who abstains from meat that is not gaunt?</line>
<line>For sleeping England long time have I watch&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Watching breeds leanness, leanness is all gaunt.</line>
<line>The pleasure that some fathers feed upon</line>
<line>Is my strict fast&#8212;I mean, my children&#8217;s looks;</line>
<line>And therein fasting, hast thou made me gaunt.</line>
<line>Gaunt am I for the grave, gaunt as a grave,</line>
<line>Whose hollow womb inherits nought but bones.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line>Can sick men play so nicely with their names?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GAUNT.</speaker>
<line>No, misery makes sport to mock itself:</line>
<line>Since thou dost seek to kill my name in me,</line>
<line>I mock my name, great King, to flatter thee.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line>Should dying men flatter with those that live?</line>

<speech>
<speaker>GAUNT.</speaker>
<line>No, no, men living flatter those that die.</line>

<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line>Thou, now a-dying, sayest thou flatterest me.</line>

<line>Now He that made me knows I see thee ill,</line>
<line>Ill in myself to see, and in thee, seeing ill.</line>
<line>Thy death-bed is no lesser than thy land,</line>
<line>Wherein thou liest in reputation sick,</line>
<line>And thou, too careless patient as thou art,</line>
<line>Commit&#8217;st thy anointed body to the cure</line>
<line>Of those physicians that first wounded thee.</line>
<line>A thousand flatterers sit within thy crown,</line>
<line>Whose compass is no bigger than thy head,</line>
<line>And yet, incaged in so small a verge,</line>
<line>The waste is no whit lesser than thy land.</line>
<line>O had thy grandsire with a prophet&#8217;s eye</line>
<line>Seen how his son&#8217;s son should destroy his sons,</line>
<line>From forth thy reach he would have laid thy shame,</line>
<line>Deposing thee before thou wert possess&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Which art possess&#8217;d now to depose thyself.</line>
<line>Why, cousin, wert thou regent of the world,</line>
<line>It were a shame to let this land by lease;</line>
<line>But for thy world enjoying but this land,</line>
<line>Is it not more than shame to shame it so?</line>
<line>Landlord of England art thou now, not king,</line>
<line>Thy state of law is bond-slave to the law,</line>
<line>And thou&#8212;</line>

<line offset="3">A lunatic lean-witted fool,</line>
<line>Presuming on an ague&#8217;s privilege,</line>
<line>Darest with thy frozen admonition</line>
<line>Make pale our cheek, chasing the royal blood</line>
<line>With fury from his native residence.</line>
<line>Now by my seat&#8217;s right royal majesty,</line>
<line>Wert thou not brother to great Edward&#8217;s son,</line>

<speech>
<speaker>GAUNT.</speaker>
<line>O, spare me not, my brother Edward&#8217;s son,</line>
<line>For that I was his father Edward&#8217;s son,</line>
<line>That blood already, like the pelican,</line>
<line>Hast thou tapp&#8217;d out and drunkenly carous&#8217;d.</line>
<line>My brother Gloucester, plain well-meaning soul,</line>

<line>The ripest fruit first falls, and so doth he;</line>
<line>His time is spent, our pilgrimage must be.</line>
<line>So much for that. Now for our Irish wars:</line>
<line>We must supplant those rough rug-headed kerns,</line>
<line>Which live like venom where no venom else</line>
<line>But only they have privilege to live.</line>
<line>And, for these great affairs do ask some charge,</line>
<line>Towards our assistance we do seize to us</line>
<line>The plate, coin, revenues, and moveables</line>
<line>Whereof our uncle Gaunt did stand possess&#8217;d.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>YORK.</speaker>
<line>How long shall I be patient? Ah, how long</line>
<line>Shall tender duty make me suffer wrong?</line>
<line>Not Gloucester&#8217;s death, nor Herford&#8217;s banishment,</line>
<line>Not Gaunt&#8217;s rebukes, nor England&#8217;s private wrongs,</line>
<line>Nor the prevention of poor Bullingbrook</line>
<line>About his marriage, nor my own disgrace,</line>
<line>Have ever made me sour my patient cheek,</line>
<line>Or bend one wrinkle on my sovereign&#8217;s face.</line>
<line>I am the last of noble Edward&#8217;s sons,</line>
<line>Of whom thy father, Prince of Wales, was first.</line>
<line>In war was never lion rag&#8217;d more fierce,</line>
<line>In peace was never gentle lamb more mild,</line>

<line>His face thou hast, for even so look&#8217;d he,</line>
<line>Accomplish&#8217;d with the number of thy hours;</line>
<line>But when he frowned it was against the French,</line>
<line>And not against his friends. His noble hand</line>
<line>Did win what he did spend, and spent not that</line>
<line>Which his triumphant father&#8217;s hand had won.</line>
<line>His hands were guilty of no kinred blood,</line>

<line>O Richard! York is too far gone with grief,</line>

<line>Seek you to seize and gripe into your hands</line>
<line>The royalties and rights of banish&#8217;d Herford?</line>
<line>Is not Gaunt dead? And doth not Herford live?</line>
<line>Was not Gaunt just? And is not Harry true?</line>

<line>Take Herford&#8217;s rights away, and take from Time</line>

<line>Let not tomorrow then ensue today;</line>

<line>And living too, for now his son is Duke.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WILLO.</speaker>
<line>Barely in title, not in revenues.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NORTH.</speaker>
<line>Richly in both, if justice had her right.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROSS.</speaker>
<line>My heart is great, but it must break with silence,</line>
<line>Ere&#8217;t be disburdened with a liberal tongue.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NORTH.</speaker>
<line>Nay, speak thy mind, and let him ne&#8217;er speak more</line>
<line>That speaks thy words again to do thee harm!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WILLO.</speaker>
<line>Tends that thou wouldst speak to the Duke of Herford?</line>
<line>If it be so, out with it boldly, man,</line>
<line>Quick is mine ear to hear of good towards him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROSS.</speaker>
<line>No good at all that I can do for him,</line>
<line>Unless you call it good to pity him,</line>
<line>Bereft and gelded of his patrimony.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NORTH.</speaker>
<line>Now, afore God, &#8217;tis shame such wrongs are borne</line>
<line>In him, a royal prince, and many more</line>
<line>Of noble blood in this declining land.</line>
<line>The King is not himself, but basely led</line>
<line>By flatterers, and what they will inform,</line>
<line>Merely in hate, &#8217;gainst any of us all,</line>
<line>That will the King severely prosecute</line>
<line>&#8217;Gainst us, our lives, our children, and our heirs.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROSS.</speaker>
<line>The commons hath he pill&#8217;d with grievous taxes,</line>

<line>For ancient quarrels, and quite lost their hearts.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WILLO.</speaker>
<line>And daily new exactions are devis&#8217;d,</line>
<line>As blanks, benevolences, and I wot not what.</line>
<line>But what a&#8217; God&#8217;s name doth become of this?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NORTH.</speaker>
<line>Wars hath not wasted it, for warr&#8217;d he hath not,</line>
<line>But basely yielded upon compromise</line>
<line>That which his noble ancestors achiev&#8217;d with blows.</line>
<line>More hath he spent in peace than they in wars.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROSS.</speaker>
<line>The Earl of Wiltshire hath the realm in farm.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WILLO.</speaker>
<line>The King&#8217;s grown bankrout, like a broken man.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NORTH.</speaker>
<line>Reproach and dissolution hangeth over him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROSS.</speaker>
<line>He hath not money for these Irish wars,</line>
<line>His burdenous taxations notwithstanding,</line>
<line>But by the robbing of the banish&#8217;d Duke.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NORTH.</speaker>
<line>His noble kinsman&#8212;most degenerate king!</line>
<line>But, lords, we hear this fearful tempest sing,</line>
<line>Yet seek no shelter to avoid the storm;</line>
<line>We see the wind sit sore upon our sails,</line>
<line>And yet we strike not, but securely perish.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROSS.</speaker>
<line>We see the very wrack that we must suffer,</line>
<line>And unavoided is the danger now,</line>
<line>For suffering so the causes of our wrack.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NORTH.</speaker>
<line>Not so, even through the hollow eyes of death</line>
<line>I spy life peering, but I dare not say</line>
<line>How near the tidings of our comfort is.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WILLO.</speaker>
<line>Nay, let us share thy thoughts, as thou dost ours.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROSS.</speaker>
<line>Be confident to speak, Northumberland:</line>
<line>We three are but thyself, and, speaking so,</line>
<line>Thy words are but as thoughts, therefore be bold.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NORTH.</speaker>
<line>Then thus: I have from Le Port Blanc,</line>
<line>A bay in Britain, receiv&#8217;d intelligence</line>
<line>That Harry Duke of Herford, Rainold Lord Cobham,</line>
<line>Thomas, son and heir to th&#8217; Earl of Arundel,</line>
<line>That late broke from the Duke of Exeter,</line>
<line>His brother, Archbishop late of Canterbury,</line>
<line>Sir Thomas Erpingham, Sir John Ramston,</line>
<line>Sir John Norbery, Sir Robert Waterton, and Francis Coint&#8212;</line>
<line>All these, well furnished by the Duke of Britain</line>
<line>With eight tall ships, three thousand men of war,</line>
<line>Are making hither with all due expedience,</line>
<line>And shortly mean to touch our northern shore.</line>
<line>Perhaps they had ere this, but that they stay</line>
<line>The first departing of the King for Ireland.</line>
<line>If then we shall shake off our slavish yoke,</line>
<line>Imp out our drooping country&#8217;s broken wing,</line>
<line>Redeem from broking pawn the blemish&#8217;d crown,</line>
<line>Wipe off the dust that hides our sceptre&#8217;s gilt,</line>
<line>And make high majesty look like itself,</line>
<line>Away with me in post to Ravenspurgh;</line>
<line>But if you faint, as fearing to do so,</line>
<line>Stay, and be secret, and myself will go.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROSS.</speaker>
<line>To horse, to horse! Urge doubts to them that fear.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WILLO.</speaker>
<line>Hold out my horse, and I will first be there.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>BUSHY.</speaker>
<line>Madam, your Majesty is too much sad.</line>
<line>You promis&#8217;d, when you parted with the King,</line>
<line>To lay aside life-harming heaviness</line>
<line>And entertain a cheerful disposition.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>QUEEN.</speaker>
<line>To please the King I did, to please myself</line>
<line>I cannot do it; yet I know no cause</line>
<line>Why I should welcome such a guest as grief,</line>
<line>Save bidding farewell to so sweet a guest</line>
<line>As my sweet Richard. Yet again methinks</line>
<line>Some unborn sorrow, ripe in fortune&#8217;s womb,</line>
<line>Is coming towards me, and my inward soul</line>
<line>With nothing trembles; at some thing it grieves,</line>
<line>More than with parting from my lord the King.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BUSHY.</speaker>
<line>Each substance of a grief hath twenty shadows,</line>
<line>Which shows like grief itself, but is not so;</line>
<line>For sorrow&#8217;s eyes, glazed with blinding tears,</line>
<line>Divides one thing entire to many objects,</line>
<line>Like perspectives, which rightly gaz&#8217;d upon</line>
<line>Show nothing but confusion; ey&#8217;d awry</line>
<line>Distinguish form; so your sweet Majesty,</line>
<line>Looking awry upon your lord&#8217;s departure,</line>
<line>Find shapes of grief, more than himself, to wail,</line>
<line>Which, look&#8217;d on as it is, is nought but shadows</line>
<line>Of what it is not; then, thrice-gracious Queen,</line>
<line>More than your lord&#8217;s departure weep not&#8212;more is not seen,</line>
<line>Or if it be, &#8217;tis with false sorrow&#8217;s eye,</line>
<line>Which for things true weeps things imaginary.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>QUEEN.</speaker>
<line>It may be so; but yet my inward soul</line>
<line>Persuades me it is otherwise. Howe&#8217;er it be,</line>
<line>I cannot but be sad; so heavy sad,</line>
<line>As, though on thinking on no thought I think,</line>
<line>Makes me with heavy nothing faint and shrink.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BUSHY.</speaker>
<line>&#8217;Tis nothing but conceit, my gracious lady.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>QUEEN.</speaker>
<line>&#8217;Tis nothing less: conceit is still deriv&#8217;d</line>
<line>From some forefather grief; mine is not so,</line>
<line>For nothing hath begot my something grief,</line>
<line>Or something hath the nothing that I grieve&#8212;</line>
<line>&#8217;Tis in reversion that I do possess&#8212;</line>
<line>But what it is that is not yet known what,</line>
<line>I cannot name; &#8217;tis nameless woe, I wot.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>QUEEN.</speaker>
<line>Why hopest thou so? &#8217;Tis better hope he is,</line>
<line>For his designs crave haste, his haste good hope.</line>
<line>Then wherefore dost thou hope he is not shipp&#8217;d?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GREEN.</speaker>
<line>That he, our hope, might have retir&#8217;d his power,</line>
<line>And driven into despair an enemy&#8217;s hope,</line>
<line>Who strongly hath set footing in this land:</line>
<line>The banish&#8217;d Bullingbrook repeals himself,</line>
<line>And with uplifted arms is safe arriv&#8217;d</line>
<line>At Ravenspurgh.</line>
</speech>

<line offset="3">Now God in heaven forbid!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GREEN.</speaker>
<line>Ah, madam! &#8217;Tis too true, and that is worse,</line>
<line>The Lord Northumberland, his son young Harry Percy,</line>
<line>The Lords of Ross, Beaumond, and Willoughby,</line>
<line>With all their powerful friends, are fled to him.</line>

<speech>

<line>Why have you not proclaim&#8217;d Northumberland</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GREEN.</speaker>
<line>We have, whereupon the Earl of Worcester</line>
<line>Hath broken his staff, resign&#8217;d his stewardship,</line>
<line>And all the household servants fled with him</line>
<line>To Bullingbrook.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>QUEEN.</speaker>
<line>So, Green, thou art the midwife to my woe,</line>
<line>And Bullingbrook my sorrow&#8217;s dismal heir.</line>
<line>Now hath my soul brought forth her prodigy,</line>
<line>And I, a gasping new-deliver&#8217;d mother,</line>
<line>Have woe to woe, sorrow to sorrow join&#8217;d.</line>

<line>Despair not, madam.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>QUEEN.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Who shall hinder me?</line>
<line>I will despair, and be at enmity</line>
<line>With cozening hope. He is a flatterer,</line>

<line>The nobles they are fled, the commons they are cold,</line>

<line>The King had cut off my head with my brother&#8217;s.</line>
<line>What, are there no posts disparch&#8217;d for Ireland?</line>
<line>How shall we do for money for these wars?</line>
<line>Come, sister&#8212;cousin, I would say&#8212;pray pardon me.</line>
<line>Go, fellow, get thee home, provide some carts,</line>

<line>Gentlemen, will you go muster men? If I</line>
<line>Know how or which way to order these affairs</line>
<line>Thus disorderly thrust into my hands,</line>
<line>Never believe me. Both are my kinsmen:</line>
<line>T&#8217; one is my sovereign, whom both my oath</line>

<line>Is my kinsman, whom the King hath wrong&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Whom conscience and my kinred bids to right.</line>
<line>Well, somewhat we must do.</line>
<line>Come, cousin, I&#8217;ll dispose of you.</line>
<line>Gentlemen, go muster up your men,</line>
<line>And meet me presently at Berkeley.</line>

<speaker>NORTH.</speaker>
<line>Believe me, noble lord,</line>
<line>I am a stranger here in Gloucestershire.</line>
<line>These high wild hills and rough uneven ways</line>
<line>Draws out our miles and makes them wearisome,</line>
<line>And yet your fair discourse hath been as sugar,</line>
<line>Making the hard way sweet and delectable.</line>
<line>But I bethink me what a weary way</line>
<line>From Ravenspurgh to Cotshall will be found</line>
<line>In Ross and Willoughby, wanting your company,</line>
<line>Which, I protest, hath very much beguil&#8217;d</line>
<line>The tediousness and process of my travel.</line>
<line>But theirs is sweet&#8217;ned with the hope to have</line>
<line>The present benefit which I possess,</line>

<line>He was not so resolv&#8217;d when last we spake together.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PERCY.</speaker>
<line>Because your lordship was proclaimed traitor.</line>
<line>But he, my lord, is gone to Ravenspurgh</line>
<line>To offer service to the Duke of Herford,</line>
<line>And sent me over by Berkeley, to discover</line>
<line>What power the Duke of York had levied there,</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PERCY.</speaker>
<line>My gracious lord, I tender you my service,</line>

<line>Tut, tut!</line>

<line>I am no traitor&#8217;s uncle, and that word &#8220;grace&#8221;</line>
<line>In an ungracious mouth is but profane.</line>
<line>Why have those banish&#8217;d and forbidden legs</line>
<line>Dar&#8217;d once to touch a dust of England&#8217;s ground?</line>
<line>But then more &#8220;why?&#8221;&#8212;why have they dar&#8217;d to march</line>

<line>Frighting her pale-fac&#8217;d villages with war</line>
<line>And ostentation of despised arms?</line>
<line>Com&#8217;st thou because the anointed King is hence?</line>
<line>Why, foolish boy, the King is left behind,</line>
<line>And in my loyal bosom lies his power.</line>
<line>Were I but now lord of such hot youth</line>
<line>As when brave Gaunt, thy father, and myself</line>
<line>Rescued the Black Prince, that young Mars of men,</line>
<line>From forth the ranks of many thousand French,</line>
<line>O then how quickly should this arm of mine,</line>
<line>Now prisoner to the palsy, chastise thee,</line>
<line>And minister correction to thy fault!</line>
</speech>

<line>In braving arms against thy sovereign.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BULL.</speaker>
<line>As I was banish&#8217;d, I was banish&#8217;d Herford,</line>
<line>But as I come, I come for Lancaster.</line>
<line>And, noble uncle, I beseech your Grace</line>
<line>Look on my wrongs with an indifferent eye.</line>
<line>You are my father, for methinks in you</line>
<line>I see old Gaunt alive. O then, my father,</line>
<line>Will you permit that I shall stand condemn&#8217;d</line>
<line>A wandering vagabond, my rights and royalties</line>
<line>Pluck&#8217;d from my arms perforce&#8212;and given away</line>
<line>To upstart unthrifts? Wherefore was I born?</line>
<line>If that my cousin king be King in England,</line>
<line>It must be granted I am Duke of Lancaster.</line>
<line>You have a son, Aumerle, my noble cousin,</line>
<line>Had you first died, and he been thus trod down,</line>
<line>He should have found his uncle Gaunt a father</line>
<line>To rouse his wrongs and chase them to the bay.</line>
<line>I am denied to sue my livery here,</line>
<line>And yet my letters-patents give me leave.</line>
<line>My father&#8217;s goods are all distrain&#8217;d and sold,</line>
<line>And these, and all, are all amiss employed.</line>
<line>What would you have me do? I am a subject,</line>
<line>And I challenge law. Attorneys are denied me,</line>
<line>And therefore personally I lay my claim</line>
<line>To my inheritance of free descent.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NORTH.</speaker>
<line>The noble Duke hath been too much abused.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROSS.</speaker>
<line>It stands your Grace upon to do him right.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WILLO.</speaker>
<line>Base men by his endowments are made great.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>YORK.</speaker>
<line>My lords of England, let me tell you this:</line>
<line>I have had feeling of my cousin&#8217;s wrongs,</line>
<line>And labor&#8217;d all I could to do him right;</line>
<line>But in this kind to come, in braving arms,</line>
<line>Be his own carver and cut out his way,</line>
<line>To find out right with wrong&#8212;it may not be;</line>
<line>And you that do abet him in this kind</line>
<line>Cherish rebellion and are rebels all.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NORTH.</speaker>
<line>The noble Duke hath sworn his coming is</line>
<line>But for his own; and for the right of that</line>
<line>We all have strongly sworn to give him aid;</line>
<line>And let him never see joy that breaks that oath!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>YORK.</speaker>
<line>Well, well, I see the issue of these arms.</line>
<line>I cannot mend it, I must needs confess,</line>
<line>Because my power is weak and all ill left;</line>
<line>But if I could, by Him that gave me life,</line>
<line>I would attach you all, and make you stoop</line>
<line>Unto the sovereign mercy of the King;</line>
<line>But since I cannot, be it known unto you</line>
<line>I do remain as neuter. So fare you well,</line>
<line>Unless you please to enter in the castle,</line>
<line>And there repose you for this night.</line>
</speech>

<line>Throw death upon thy sovereign&#8217;s enemies.</line>
<line>Mock not my senseless conjuration, lords,</line>
<line>This earth shall have a feeling, and these stones</line>
<line>Prove armed soldiers, ere her native king</line>
<line>Shall falter under foul rebellion&#8217;s arms.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CAR.</speaker>
<line>Fear not, my lord, that Power that made you king</line>
<line>Hath power to keep you king in spite of all.</line>
<line>The means that heavens yield must be embrac&#8217;d,</line>
<line>And not neglected; else heaven would,</line>
<line>And we will not. Heaven&#8217;s offer we refuse,</line>
<line>The proffered means of succors and redress.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>AUM.</speaker>
<line>He means, my lord, that we are too remiss,</line>
<line>Whilst Bullingbrook, through our security,</line>
<line>Grows strong and great in substance and in power.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line>Discomfortable cousin, know&#8217;st thou not</line>
<line>That when the searching eye of heaven is hid</line>
<line>Behind the globe, that lights the lower world,</line>
<line>Then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen</line>
<line>In murders and in outrage boldly here,</line>
<line>But when from under this terrestrial ball</line>
<line>He fires the proud tops of the eastern pines</line>
<line>And darts his light through every guilty hole,</line>
<line>Then murders, treasons, and detested sins,</line>
<line>The cloak of night being pluck&#8217;d from off their backs,</line>
<line>Stand bare and naked, trembling at themselves?</line>
<line>So when this thief, this traitor Bullingbrook,</line>
<line>Who all this while hath revell&#8217;d in the night,</line>
<line>Whilst we were wand&#8217;ring with the antipodes,</line>
<line>Shall see us rising in our throne, the east,</line>
<line>His treasons will sit blushing in his face,</line>
<line>Not able to endure the sight of day,</line>
<line>But self-affrighted tremble at his sin.</line>
<line>Not all the water in the rough rude sea</line>
<line>Can wash the balm off from an anointed king;</line>
<line>The breath of worldly men cannot depose</line>
<line>The deputy elected by the Lord;</line>
<line>For every man that Bullingbrook hath press&#8217;d</line>
<line>To lift shrewd steel against our golden crown,</line>
<line>God for his Richard hath in heavenly pay</line>
<line>A glorious angel; then if angels fight,</line>
<line>Weak men must fall, for heaven still guards the right.</line>

<stagedir>Enter Salisbury.</stagedir>
<line>Welcome, my lord. How far off lies your power?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SAL.</speaker>
<line>Nor near nor farther off, my gracious lord,</line>
<line>Than this weak arm. Discomfort guides my tongue</line>
<line>And bids me speak of nothing but despair.</line>
<line>One day too late, I fear me, noble lord,</line>
<line>Hath clouded all thy happy days on earth.</line>
<line>O, call back yesterday, bid time return,</line>
<line>And thou shalt have twelve thousand fighting men!</line>
<line>Today, today, unhappy day, too late,</line>
<line>Overthrows thy joys, friends, fortune, and thy state,</line>
<line>For all the Welshmen, hearing thou wert dead,</line>
<line>Are gone to Bullingbrook, dispers&#8217;d and fled.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>AUM.</speaker>
<line>Comfort, my liege, why looks your Grace so pale?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line>But now the blood of twenty thousand men</line>
<line>Did triumph in my face, and they are fled;</line>
<line>And till so much blood thither come again,</line>
<line>Have I not reason to look pale and dead?</line>
<line>All souls that will be safe, fly from my side,</line>
<line>For time hath set a blot upon my pride.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>AUM.</speaker>
<line>Comfort, my liege, remember who you are.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line>I had forgot myself, am I not king?</line>
<line>Awake, thou coward majesty! Thou sleepest.</line>
<line>Is not the king&#8217;s name twenty thousand names?</line>
<line>Arm, arm, my name! A puny subject strikes</line>
<line>At thy great glory. Look not to the ground,</line>
<line>Ye favorites of a king, are we not high?</line>
<line>High be our thoughts. I know my uncle York</line>
<line>Hath power enough to serve our turn. But who comes here?</line>
</speech>
<stagedir>Enter Scroop.</stagedir>

<speaker>SCROOP.</speaker>
<line>More health and happiness betide my liege</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line>Mine ear is open, and my heart prepar&#8217;d,</line>
<line>The worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold.</line>
<line>Say, is my kingdom lost? Why, &#8217;twas my care,</line>
<line>And what loss is it to be rid of care?</line>
<line>Strives Bullingbrook to be as great as we?</line>
<line>Greater he shall not be; if he serve God,</line>
<line>We&#8217;ll serve Him too, and be his fellow so.</line>
<line>Revolt our subjects? That we cannot mend,</line>
<line>They break their faith to God as well as us.</line>
<line>Cry woe, destruction, ruin, and decay:</line>
<line>The worst is death, and death will have his day.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SCROOP.</speaker>
<line>Glad am I that your Highness is so arm&#8217;d</line>
<line>To bear the tidings of calamity.</line>
<line>Like an unseasonable stormy day,</line>
<line>Which makes the silver rivers drown their shores,</line>
<line>As if the world were all dissolv&#8217;d to tears,</line>
<line>So high above his limits swells the rage</line>
<line>Of Bullingbrook, covering your fearful land</line>
<line>With hard bright steel, and hearts harder than steel.</line>
<line>White-beards have arm&#8217;d their thin and hairless scalps</line>
<line>Against thy majesty; boys, with women&#8217;s voices,</line>
<line>Strive to speak big, and clap their female joints</line>
<line>In stiff unwieldy arms against thy crown;</line>
<line>Thy very beadsmen learn to bend their bows</line>
<line>Of double-fatal yew against thy state;</line>
<line>Yea, distaff-women manage rusty bills</line>
<line>Against thy seat: both young and old rebel,</line>
<line>And all goes worse than I have power to tell.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line>Too well, too well thou tell&#8217;st a tale so ill.</line>
<line>Where is the Earl of Wiltshire? Where is Bagot?</line>
<line>What is become of Bushy? Where is Green?</line>
<line>That they have let the dangerous enemy</line>
<line>Measure our confines with such peaceful steps?</line>
<line>If we prevail, their heads shall pay for it.</line>
<line>I warrant they have made peace with Bullingbrook.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SCROOP.</speaker>
<line>Peace have they made with him indeed, my lord.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line>O villains, vipers, damn&#8217;d without redemption!</line>
<line>Dogs, easily won to fawn on any man!</line>
<line>Snakes, in my heart-blood warm&#8217;d, that sting my heart!</line>
<line>Three Judases, each one thrice worse than Judas!</line>
<line>Would they make peace? Terrible hell</line>
<line>Make war upon their spotted souls for this!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SCROOP.</speaker>
<line>Sweet love, I see, changing his property,</line>
<line>Turns to the sourest and most deadly hate.</line>
<line>Again uncurse their souls, their peace is made</line>
<line>With heads, and not with hands. Those whom you curse</line>
<line>Have felt the worst of death&#8217;s destroying wound,</line>
<line>And lie full low, grav&#8217;d in the hollow ground.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>AUM.</speaker>
<line>Is Bushy, Green, and the Earl of Wiltshire dead?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SCROOP.</speaker>
<line>Ay, all of them at Bristow lost their heads.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line>No matter where&#8212;of comfort no man speak:</line>
<line>Let&#8217;s talk of graves, of worms, and epitaphs,</line>
<line>Make dust our paper, and with rainy eyes</line>
<line>Write sorrow on the bosom of the earth.</line>
<line>Let&#8217;s choose executors and talk of wills;</line>
<line>And yet not so, for what can we bequeath</line>
<line>Save our deposed bodies to the ground?</line>
<line>Our lands, our lives, and all are Bullingbrook&#8217;s,</line>
<line>And nothing can we call our own but death,</line>
<line>And that small model of the barren earth</line>
<line>Which serves as paste and cover to our bones.</line>
<line>For God&#8217;s sake let us sit upon the ground</line>
<line>And tell sad stories of the death of kings:</line>
<line>How some have been depos&#8217;d, some slain in war,</line>
<line>Some haunted by the ghosts they have deposed,</line>
<line>Some poisoned by their wives, some sleeping kill&#8217;d,</line>
<line>All murdered&#8212;for within the hollow crown</line>
<line>That rounds the mortal temples of a king</line>
<line>Keeps Death his court, and there the antic sits,</line>
<line>Scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp,</line>
<line>Allowing him a breath, a little scene,</line>
<line>To monarchize, be fear&#8217;d, and kill with looks,</line>
<line>Infusing him with self and vain conceit,</line>
<line>As if this flesh which walls about our life</line>
<line>Were brass impregnable; and humor&#8217;d thus,</line>
<line>Comes at the last and with a little pin</line>
<line>Bores thorough his castle wall, and farewell king!</line>
<line>Cover your heads, and mock not flesh and blood</line>
<line>With solemn reverence, throw away respect,</line>
<line>Tradition, form, and ceremonious duty,</line>
<line>For you have but mistook me all this while.</line>
<line>I live with bread like you, feel want,</line>
<line>Taste grief, need friends: subjected thus,</line>
<line>How can you say to me I am a king?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CAR.</speaker>
<line>My lord, wise men ne&#8217;er sit and wail their woes,</line>
<line>But presently prevent the ways to wail;</line>
<line>To fear the foe, since fear oppresseth strength,</line>
<line>Gives in your weakness strength unto your foe,</line>
<line>And so your follies fight against yourself.</line>
<line>Fear, and be slain&#8212;no worse can come to fight,</line>
<line>And fight and die is death destroying death,</line>
<line>Where fearing dying pays death servile breath.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>AUM.</speaker>
<line>My father hath a power, inquire of him,</line>
<line>And learn to make a body of a limb.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line>Thou chid&#8217;st me well. Proud Bullingbrook, I come</line>
<line>To change blows with thee for our day of doom.</line>
<line>This ague fit of fear is overblown,</line>
<line>An easy task it is to win our own.</line>
<line>Say, Scroop, where lies our uncle with his power?</line>
<line>Speak sweetly, man, although thy looks be sour.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SCROOP.</speaker>
<line>Men judge by the complexion of the sky</line>
<line>The state and inclination of the day;</line>
<line>So may you by my dull and heavy eye:</line>
<line>My tongue hath but a heavier tale to say.</line>
<line>I play the torturer by small and small</line>
<line>To lengthen out the worst that must be spoken:</line>
<line>Your uncle York is join&#8217;d with Bullingbrook,</line>
<line>And all your northern castles yielded up,</line>
<line>And all your southern gentlemen in arms</line>
<line>Upon his party.</line>

<line offset="3">Thou hast said enough.</line>

<stagedir>To Aumerle.</stagedir>
<line>Beshrew thee, cousin, which didst lead me forth</line>
<line>Of that sweet way I was in to despair!</line>
<line>What say you now? What comfort have we now?</line>
<line>By heaven, I&#8217;ll hate him everlastingly</line>
<line>That bids me be of comfort any more.</line>
<line>Go to Flint castle, there I&#8217;ll pine away&#8212;</line>
<line>A king, woe&#8217;s slave, shall kingly woe obey.</line>
<line>That power I have, discharge, and let them go</line>
<line>To ear the land that hath some hope to grow,</line>
<line>For I have none. Let no man speak again</line>
<line>To alter this, for counsel is but vain.</line>

<line offset="4">He does me double wrong</line>

<speech>
<speaker>BULL.</speaker>
<line>So that by this intelligence we learn</line>
<line>The Welshmen are dispers&#8217;d, and Salisbury</line>
<line>Is gone to meet the King, who lately landed</line>
<line>With some few private friends upon this coast.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NORTH.</speaker>
<line>The news is very fair and good, my lord:</line>
<line>Richard not far from hence hath hid his head.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>YORK.</speaker>
<line>It would beseem the Lord Northumberland</line>
<line>To say King Richard. Alack the heavy day</line>
<line>When such a sacred king should hide his head!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NORTH.</speaker>
<line>Your Grace mistakes; only to be brief</line>
<line>Left I his title out.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>YORK.</speaker>
<line offset="4">The time hath been,</line>
<line>Would you have been so brief with him, he would</line>
<line>Have been so brief with you to shorten you,</line>
<line>For taking so the head, your whole head&#8217;s length.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BULL.</speaker>
<line>Mistake not, uncle, further than you should.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>YORK.</speaker>
<line>Take not, good cousin, further than you should,</line>
<line>Lest you mistake the heavens are over our heads.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BULL.</speaker>
<line>I know it, uncle, and oppose not myself</line>
<line>Against their will. But who comes here?</line>

<stagedir>Enter Harry Percy.</stagedir>
<line>Welcome, Harry. What, will not this castle yield?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PERCY.</speaker>
<line>The castle royally is mann&#8217;d, my lord,</line>
<line>Against thy entrance.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BULL.</speaker>
<line>Royally?</line>
<line>Why, it contains no king.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PERCY.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Yes, my good lord,</line>
<line>It doth contain a king. King Richard lies</line>
<line>Within the limits of yon lime and stone,</line>
<line>And with him are the Lord Aumerle, Lord Salisbury,</line>
<line>Sir Stephen Scroop, besides a clergyman</line>
<line>Of holy reverence, who, I cannot learn.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NORTH.</speaker>
<line>O, belike it is the Bishop of Carlisle.</line>
</speech>


<speech>
<speaker>BULL.</speaker>
<stagedir>To Northumberland.</stagedir>
<line>Noble lord,</line>
<line>Go to the rude ribs of that ancient castle;</line>
<line>Through brazen trumpet send the breath of parley</line>
<line>Into his ruin&#8217;d ears, and thus deliver:</line>
<line>Henry Bullingbrook</line>
<line>On both his knees doth kiss King Richard&#8217;s hand,</line>
<line>And sends allegiance and true faith of heart</line>
<line>To his most royal person; hither come</line>
<line>Even at his feet to lay my arms and power,</line>
<line>Provided that my banishment repeal&#8217;d</line>
<line>And lands restor&#8217;d again be freely granted.</line>
<line>If not, I&#8217;ll use the advantage of my power,</line>
<line>And lay the summer&#8217;s dust with show&#8217;rs of blood</line>
<line>Rain&#8217;d from the wounds of slaughtered Englishmen,</line>
<line>The which, how far off from the mind of Bullingbrook</line>
<line>It is, such crimson tempest should bedrench</line>
<line>The fresh green lap of fair King Richard&#8217;s land,</line>
<line>My stooping duty tenderly shall show.</line>
<line>Go signify as much, while here we march</line>
<line>Upon the grassy carpet of this plain.</line>

<stagedir>Northumberland advances to the castle, with a Trumpet.</stagedir>
<line>Let&#8217;s march without the noise of threat&#8217;ning drum,</line>
<line>That from this castle&#8217;s tottered battlements</line>
<line>Our fair appointments may be well perus&#8217;d.</line>
<line>Methinks King Richard and myself should meet</line>
<line>With no less terror than the elements</line>
<line>Of fire and water, when their thund&#8217;ring shock</line>
<line>At meeting tears the cloudy cheeks of heaven.</line>
<line>Be he the fire, I&#8217;ll be the yielding water;</line>
<line>The rage be his, whilst on the earth I rain</line>
<line>My waters&#8212;on the earth, and not on him.</line>
<line>March on, and mark King Richard how he looks.</line>

<stagedir>The trumpets sound parle without and answer within; then a flourish. Richard appeareth on the walls with Carlisle, Aumerle, Scroop, Salisbury.</stagedir>
<line>See, see, King Richard doth himself appear,</line>
<line>As doth the blushing discontented sun</line>
<line>From out the fiery portal of the east,</line>
<line>When he perceives the envious clouds are bent</line>
<line>To dim his glory and to stain the track</line>
<line>Of his bright passage to the occident.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>YORK.</speaker>
<line>Yet looks he like a king! Behold, his eye,</line>
<line>As bright as is the eagle&#8217;s, lightens forth</line>
<line>Controlling majesty. Alack, alack for woe,</line>
<line>That any harm should stain so fair a show!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>

<stagedir>To Northumberland.</stagedir>
<line>We are amaz&#8217;d, and thus long have we stood</line>
<line>To watch the fearful bending of thy knee,</line>
<line>Because we thought ourself thy lawful king;</line>
<line>And if we be, how dare thy joints forget</line>
<line>To pay their aweful duty to our presence?</line>
<line>If we be not, show us the hand of God</line>
<line>That hath dismiss&#8217;d us from our stewardship,</line>
<line>For well we know no hand of blood and bone</line>
<line>Can gripe the sacred handle of our sceptre,</line>
<line>Unless he do profane, steal, or usurp.</line>
<line>And though you think that all, as you have done,</line>
<line>Have torn their souls by turning them from us,</line>
<line>And we are barren and bereft of friends,</line>
<line>Yet know, my master, God omnipotent,</line>
<line>Is mustering in his clouds on our behalf</line>
<line>Armies of pestilence, and they shall strike</line>
<line>Your children yet unborn and unbegot,</line>
<line>That lift your vassal hands against my head,</line>
<line>And threat the glory of my precious crown.</line>
<line>Tell Bullingbrook&#8212;for yon methinks he stands&#8212;</line>
<line>That every stride he makes upon my land</line>
<line>Is dangerous treason. He is come to open</line>
<line>The purple testament of bleeding war;</line>
<line>But ere the crown he looks for live in peace,</line>
<line>Ten thousand bloody crowns of mothers&#8217; sons</line>
<line>Shall ill become the flower of England&#8217;s face,</line>
<line>Change the complexion of her maid-pale peace</line>
<line>To scarlet indignation, and bedew</line>
<line>Her pasters&#8217; grass with faithful English blood.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NORTH.</speaker>
<line>The King of heaven forbid our lord the King</line>
<line>Should so with civil and uncivil arms</line>
<line>Be rush&#8217;d upon! Thy thrice-noble cousin,</line>
<line>Harry Bullingbrook, doth humbly kiss thy hand,</line>
<line>And by the honorable tomb he swears</line>
<line>That stands upon your royal grandsire&#8217;s bones,</line>
<line>And by the royalties of both your bloods,</line>
<line>Currents that spring from one most gracious head,</line>
<line>And by the buried hand of warlike Gaunt,</line>
<line>And by the worth and honor of himself,</line>
<line>Comprising all that may be sworn or said,</line>
<line>His coming hither hath no further scope</line>
<line>Than for his lineal royalties, and to beg</line>
<line>Enfranchisement immediate on his knees,</line>
<line>Which on thy royal party granted once,</line>
<line>His glittering arms he will commend to rust,</line>
<line>His barbed steeds to stables, and his heart</line>
<line>To faithful service of your Majesty.</line>
<line>This swears he, as he is a prince, is just,</line>
<line>And as I am a gentleman I credit him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line>Northumberland, say thus the King returns:</line>
<line>His noble cousin is right welcome hither,</line>
<line>And all the number of his fair demands</line>
<line>Shall be accomplish&#8217;d without contradiction.</line>
<line>With all the gracious utterance thou hast</line>
<line>Speak to his gentle hearing kind commends.</line>

<stagedir>Northumberland withdraws to Bullingbrook.</stagedir>


<stagedir>To Aumerle.</stagedir>
<line>We do debase ourselves, cousin, do we not,</line>
<line>To look so poorly and to speak so fair?</line>
<line>Shall we call back Northumberland, and send</line>
<line>Defiance to the traitor, and so die?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>AUM.</speaker>
<line>No, good my lord, let&#8217;s fight with gentle swords.</line>
<line>Till time lend friends, and friends their helpful swords.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line>O God, O God, that e&#8217;er this tongue of mine</line>
<line>That laid the sentence of dread banishment</line>
<line>On yon proud man should take it off again</line>
<line>With words of sooth! O that I were as great</line>
<line>As is my grief, or lesser than my name!</line>
<line>Or that I could forget what I have been!</line>
<line>Or not remember what I must be now!</line>
<line>Swell&#8217;st thou, proud heart? I&#8217;ll give thee scope to beat,</line>
<line>Since foes have scope to beat both thee and me.</line>

<line>Northumberland comes back from Bullingbrook.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line>What must the King do now? Must he submit?</line>
<line>The King shall do it. Must he be depos&#8217;d?</line>
<line>The King shall be contented. Must he lose</line>
<line>The name of king? A&#8217; God&#8217;s name let it go.</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll give my jewels for a set of beads,</line>
<line>My gorgeous palace for a hermitage,</line>
<line>My gay apparel for an almsman&#8217;s gown,</line>
<line>My figur&#8217;d goblets for a dish of wood,</line>
<line>My sceptre for a palmer&#8217;s walking-staff,</line>
<line>My subjects for a pair of carved saints,</line>
<line>And my large kingdom for a little grave,</line>
<line>A little little grave, an obscure grave&#8212;</line>
<line>Or I&#8217;ll be buried in the king&#8217;s high way,</line>
<line>Some way of common trade, where subjects&#8217; feet</line>
<line>May hourly trample on their sovereign&#8217;s head;</line>
<line>For on my heart they tread now whilst I live,</line>
<line>And buried once, why not upon my head?</line>
<line>Aumerle, thou weep&#8217;st, my tender-hearted cousin!</line>
<line>We&#8217;ll make foul weather with despised tears;</line>
<line>Our sighs and they shall lodge the summer corn,</line>
<line>And make a dearth in this revolting land.</line>
<line>Or shall we play the wantons with our woes</line>
<line>And make some pretty match with shedding tears?</line>
<line>As thus to drop them still upon one place,</line>

<line>Most mighty prince, my Lord Northumberland,</line>

<speaker>QUEEN.</speaker>
<line>What sport shall we devise here in this garden</line>
<line>To drive away the heavy thought of care?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. LADY.</speaker>
<line>Madam, we&#8217;ll play at bowls.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>QUEEN.</speaker>
<line>&#8217;Twill make me think the world is full of rubs,</line>

<speaker>1. LADY.</speaker>
<line>Madam, we&#8217;ll dance.</line>

<speaker>QUEEN.</speaker>
<line>My legs can keep no measure in delight,</line>

<speaker>1. LADY.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Of either, madam.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>QUEEN.</speaker>
<line>Of neither, girl;</line>
<line>For if of joy, being altogether wanting,</line>
<line>It doth remember me the more of sorrow;</line>
<line>Or if of grief, being altogether had,</line>
<line>It adds more sorrow to my want of joy;</line>
<line>For what I have I need not to repeat,</line>
<line>And what I want it boots not to complain.</line>

<line>Let&#8217;s step into the shadow of these trees.</line>

<line>Go thou, and like an executioner</line>
<line>Cut off the heads of too fast growing sprays,</line>
<line>That look too lofty in our commonwealth:</line>
<line>All must be even in our government.</line>
<line>You thus employed, I will go root away</line>

<speech>
<speaker>1. MAN.</speaker>
<line>Why should we in the compass of a pale</line>
<line>Keep law and form and due proportion,</line>
<line>Showing as in a model our firm estate,</line>
<line>When our sea-walled garden, the whole land,</line>
<line>Is full of weeds, her fairest flowers chok&#8217;d up,</line>
<line>Her fruit-trees all unprun&#8217;d, her hedges ruin&#8217;d,</line>

<line>Are pluck&#8217;d up root and all by Bullingbrook,</line>
<line>I mean the Earl of Wiltshire, Bushy, Green.</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GARD.</speaker>
<line offset="4">They are; and Bullingbrook</line>

<line>That he had not so trimm&#8217;d and dress&#8217;d his land</line>
<line>As we this garden! We at time of year</line>
<line>Do wound the bark, the skin of our fruit-trees,</line>
<line>Lest being over-proud in sap and blood,</line>
<line>With too much riches it confound itself;</line>
<line>Had he done so to great and growing men,</line>
<line>They might have liv&#8217;d to bear and he to taste</line>
<line>Their fruits of duty. Superfluous branches</line>
<line>We lop away, that bearing boughs may live;</line>
<line>Had he done so, himself had borne the crown,</line>
<line>Which waste of idle hours hath quite thrown down.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. MAN.</speaker>
<line>What, think you the King shall be deposed?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GARD.</speaker>
<line>Depress&#8217;d he is already, and depos&#8217;d</line>
<line>&#8217;Tis doubt he will be. Letters came last night</line>
<line>To a dear friend of the good Duke of York&#8217;s</line>
<line>That tell black tidings.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>QUEEN.</speaker>
<line>O, I am press&#8217;d to death through want of speaking!</line>

<stagedir>Coming forward.</stagedir>
<line>Thou old Adam&#8217;s likeness, set to dress this garden,</line>
<line>How dares thy harsh rude tongue sound this unpleassing news?</line>
<line>What Eve, what serpent, hath suggested thee</line>
<line>To make a second fall of cursed man?</line>
<line>Why dost thou say King Richard is depos&#8217;d?</line>
<line>Dar&#8217;st thou, thou little better thing than earth,</line>
<line>Divine his downfall? Say, where, when, and how,</line>
<line>Cam&#8217;st thou by this ill tidings? Speak, thou wretch.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GARD.</speaker>
<line>Pardon me, madam, little joy have I</line>
<line>To breathe this news, yet what I say is true:</line>
<line>King Richard, he is in the mighty hold</line>
<line>Of Bullingbrook; their fortunes both are weigh&#8217;d.</line>
<line>In your lord&#8217;s scale is nothing but himself,</line>
<line>And some few vanities that make him light;</line>
<line>But in the balance of great Bullingbrook,</line>
<line>Besides himself, are all the English peers,</line>
<line>And with that odds he weighs King Richard down.</line>
<line>Post you to London and you will find it so,</line>
<line>I speak no more than every one doth know.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>QUEEN.</speaker>
<line>Nimble mischance, that art so light of foot,</line>
<line>Doth not thy embassage belong to me,</line>
<line>And am I last that knows it? O, thou thinkest</line>
<line>To serve me last that I may longest keep</line>
<line>Thy sorrow in my breast. Come, ladies, go</line>
<line>To meet at London London&#8217;s king in woe.</line>
<line>What, was I born to this, that my sad look</line>
<line>Should grace the triumph of great Bullingbrook?</line>
<line>Gard&#8217;ner, for telling me these news of woe,</line>
<line>Pray God the plants thou graft&#8217;st may never grow.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>BAGOT.</speaker>
<line>My Lord Aumerle, I know your daring tongue</line>
<line>Scorns to unsay what once it hath delivered.</line>
<line>In that dead time when Gloucester&#8217;s death was plotted,</line>
<line>I heard you say, &#8220;Is not my arm of length,</line>
<line>That reacheth from the restful English court</line>
<line>As far as Callice, to mine uncle&#8217;s head?&#8221;</line>
<line>Amongst much other talk, that very time,</line>

<line>With the attainder of his slanderous lips.</line>
<line>There is my gage, the manual seal of death,</line>
<line>That marks thee out for hell. I say thou liest,</line>

<line>Thieves are not judg&#8217;d but they are by to hear,</line>

<line>My Lord of Herford here, whom you call king,</line>

<line>Peace shall go sleep with Turks and infidels,</line>
<line>And in this seat of peace tumultuous wars</line>

<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line>Give me the crown. Here, cousin, seize the crown;</line>
<line>Here, cousin,</line>
<line>On this side my hand, and on that side thine.</line>
<line>Now is this golden crown like a deep well</line>
<line>That owes two buckets, filling one another,</line>
<line>The emptier ever dancing in the air,</line>
<line>The other down, unseen, and full of water:</line>
<line>That bucket down and full of tears am I,</line>
<line>Drinking my griefs, whilst you mount up on high.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BULL.</speaker>
<line>I thought you had been willing to resign.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line>My crown I am, but still my griefs are mine.</line>
<line>You may my glories and my state depose,</line>
<line>But not my griefs; still am I king of those.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BULL.</speaker>
<line>Part of your cares you give me with your crown.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line>Your cares set up do not pluck my cares down:</line>
<line>My care is loss of care, by old care done,</line>
<line>Your care is gain of care, by new care won;</line>
<line>The cares I give I have, though given away,</line>
<line>They tend the crown, yet still with me they stay.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BULL.</speaker>
<line>Are you contented to resign the crown?</line>

<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line>Ay, no, no ay; for I must nothing be;</line>
<line>Therefore no no, for I resign to thee.</line>
<line>Now mark me how I will undo myself:</line>
<line>I give this heavy weight from off my head,</line>
<line>And this unwieldy sceptre from my hand,</line>
<line>The pride of kingly sway from out my heart;</line>
<line>With mine own tears I wash away my balm,</line>
<line>With mine own hands I give away my crown,</line>
<line>With mine own tongue deny my sacred state,</line>
<line>With mine own breath release all duteous oaths;</line>
<line>All pomp and majesty I do forswear;</line>
<line>My manors, rents, revenues I forgo;</line>
<line>My acts, decrees, and statutes I deny;</line>
<line>God pardon all oaths that are broke to me!</line>
<line>God keep all vows unbroke are made to thee!</line>
<line>Make me, that nothing have, with nothing griev&#8217;d,</line>
<line>And thou with all pleas&#8217;d, that hast all achiev&#8217;d!</line>
<line>Long mayst thou live in Richard&#8217;s seat to sit,</line>
<line>And soon lie Richard in an earthy pit!</line>

<line>I would to God, my lords, he might be found.</line>
<line>Inquire at London, &#8217;mongst the taverns there,</line>

<line>He prays but faintly, and would be denied,</line>
<line>We pray with heart and soul, and all beside;</line>
<line>His weary joints would gladly rise, I know,</line>
<line>Our knees still kneel till to the ground they grow;</line>

<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line>I have been studying how I may compare</line>
<line>This prison where I live unto the world;</line>
<line>And for because the world is populous,</line>
<line>And here is not a creature but myself,</line>
<line>I cannot do it; yet I&#8217;ll hammer it out.</line>
<line>My brain I&#8217;ll prove the female to my soul,</line>
<line>My soul the father, and these two beget</line>
<line>A generation of still-breeding thoughts;</line>
<line>And these some thoughts people this little world,</line>
<line>In humors like the people of this world:</line>
<line>For no thought is contented. The better sort,</line>
<line>As thoughts of things divine, are intermix&#8217;d</line>
<line>With scruples and do set the word itself</line>
<line>Against the word,</line>
<line>As thus: &#8220;Come, little ones,&#8221; and then again,</line>
<line>&#8220;It is as hard to come as for a camel</line>
<line>To thread the postern of a small needle&#8217;s eye.&#8221;</line>
<line>Thoughts tending to ambition, they do plot</line>
<line>Unlikely wonders: how these vain weak nails</line>
<line>May tear a passage thorough the flinty ribs</line>
<line>Of this hard world, my ragged prison walls;</line>
<line>And for they cannot, die in their own pride.</line>
<line>Thoughts tending to content flatter themselves</line>
<line>That they are not the first of fortune&#8217;s slaves,</line>
<line>Nor shall not be the last&#8212;like seely beggars</line>
<line>Who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame,</line>
<line>That many have and others must sit there;</line>
<line>And in this thought they find a kind of ease,</line>
<line>Bearing their own misfortunes on the back</line>
<line>Of such as have before endur&#8217;d the like.</line>
<line>Thus play I in one person many people,</line>
<line>And none contented. Sometimes am I king;</line>
<line>Then treasons make me wish myself a beggar,</line>
<line>And so I am. Then crushing penury</line>
<line>Persuades me I was better when a king;</line>
<line>Then am I king&#8217;d again, and by and by</line>
<line>Think that I am unking&#8217;d by Bullingbrook,</line>
<line>And straight am nothing. But what e&#8217;er I be,</line>
<line>Nor I, nor any man that but man is,</line>
<line>With nothing shall be pleas&#8217;d, till he be eas&#8217;d</line>
<line>With being nothing.</line>

<stagedir>The music plays.</stagedir>
<line offset="5">Music do I hear?</line>
<line>Ha, ha, keep time! How sour sweet music is</line>
<line>When time is broke, and no proportion kept!</line>
<line>So is it in the music of men&#8217;s lives.</line>
<line>And here have I the daintiness of ear</line>
<line>To check time broke in a disordered string;</line>
<line>But for the concord of my state and time</line>
<line>Had not an ear to hear my true time broke.</line>
<line>I wasted time, and now doth time waste me;</line>
<line>For now hath time made me his numb&#8217;ring clock:</line>
<line>My thoughts are minutes, and with sighs they jar</line>
<line>Their watches on unto mine eyes, the outward watch,</line>
<line>Whereto my finger, like a dial&#8217;s point,</line>
<line>Is pointing still, in cleansing them from tears.</line>
<line>Now, sir, the sound that tells what hour it is</line>
<line>Are clamorous groans, which strike upon my heart,</line>
<line>Which is the bell. So sighs, and tears, and groans</line>
<line>Show minutes, times, and hours; but my time</line>
<line>Runs posting on in Bullingbrook&#8217;s proud joy,</line>
<line>While I stand fooling here, his Jack of the clock.</line>
<line>This music mads me, let it sound no more,</line>
<line>For though it have holp mad men to their wits,</line>
<line>In me it seems it will make wise men mad.</line>
<line>Yet blessing on his heart that gives it me!</line>
<line>For &#8217;tis a sign of love; and love to Richard</line>
<line>Is a strange brooch in this all-hating world.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line>So proud that Bullingbrook was on his back!</line>
<line>That jade hath eat bread from my royal hand,</line>
<line>This hand hath made him proud with clapping him.</line>
<line>Would he not stumble? Would he not fall down,</line>
<line>Since pride must have a fall, and break the neck</line>
<line>Of that proud man that did usurp his back?</line>
<line>Forgiveness, horse! Why do I rail on thee,</line>
<line>Since thou, created to be aw&#8217;d by man,</line>
<line>Wast born to bear? I was not made a horse,</line>
<line>And yet I bear a burden like an ass,</line>
<line>Spurr&#8217;d, gall&#8217;d, and tir&#8217;d by jauncing Bullingbrook.</line>

<line>My lord, will&#8217;t please you to fall to?</line>

<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line>Taste of it first, as thou art wont to do.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KEEP.</speaker>
<line>My lord, I dare not. Sir Pierce of Exton, who</line>
<line>Lately came from the King, commands the contrary.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line>The devil take Henry of Lancaster and thee!</line>
<line>Patience is stale, and I am weary of it.</line>
</speech>
<stagedir>Beats the Keeper.</stagedir>

<speaker>KEEP.</speaker>
<line>Help, help, help!</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>The murderers, Exton and Servants, rush in armed.</stagedir>


<speech>
<speaker>K. RICH.</speaker>
<line>How now, what means death in this rude assault?</line>
<line>Villain, thy own hand yields thy death&#8217;s instrument,</line>

<stagedir>Snatches an axe from a Servant and kills him.</stagedir>
<line>Go thou and fill another room in hell.</line>

<stagedir>Kills another. Here Exton strikes him down.</stagedir>
<line>That hand shall burn in never-quenching fire</line>
<line>That staggers thus my person. Exton, thy fierce hand</line>
<line>Hath with the King&#8217;s blood stain&#8217;d the King&#8217;s own land.</line>
<line>Mount, mount, my soul! Thy seat is up on high,</line>
<line>Whilst my gross flesh sinks downward, here to die.</line>
</speech>
<stagedir>Dies.</stagedir>


<speech>
<speaker>EXTON.</speaker>
<line>As full of valure as of royal blood!</line>
<line>Both have I spill&#8217;d; O would the deed were good!</line>
<line>For now the devil that told me I did well</line>
<line>Says that this deed is chronicled in hell.</line>
<line>This dead king to the living king I&#8217;ll bear;</line>
<line>Take hence the rest, and give them burial here.</line>

<stagedir>Flourish. Enter Bullingbrook, now King Henry, with the Duke of York with other Lords and Attendants.</stagedir>


<speech>
<speaker>K. HEN.</speaker>
<line>Kind uncle York, the latest news we hear</line>
<line>Is that the rebels have consum&#8217;d with fire</line>
<line>Our town of Ciceter in Gloucestershire,</line>
<line>But whether they be ta&#8217;en or slain we hear not.</line>

<stagedir>Enter Northumberland.</stagedir>
<line>Welcome, my lord, what is the news?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NORTH.</speaker>
<line>First, to thy sacred state wish I all happiness.</line>
<line>The next news is, I have to London sent</line>
<line>The heads of Salisbury, Spencer, Blunt, and Kent.</line>
<line>The manner of their taking may appear</line>
<line>At large discoursed in this paper here.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. HEN.</speaker>
<line>We thank thee, gentle Percy, for thy pains,</line>
<line>And to thy worth will add right worthy gains.</line>
</speech>
<stagedir>Enter Lord Fitzwater.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>FITZ.</speaker>
<line>My lord, I have from Oxford sent to London</line>
<line>The heads of Brocas and Sir Bennet Seely,</line>
<line>Two of the dangerous consorted traitors</line>
<line>That sought at Oxford thy dire overthrow.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. HEN.</speaker>
<line>Thy pains, Fitzwater, shall not be forgot,</line>
<line>Right noble is thy merit, well I wot.</line>
</speech>
<stagedir>Enter Harry Percy and the Bishop of Carlisle.</stagedir>


<speech>
<speaker>PERCY.</speaker>
<line>The grand conspirator, Abbot of Westminster,</line>
<line>With clog of conscience and sour melancholy</line>
<line>Hath yielded up his body to the grave;</line>
<line>But here is Carlisle living, to abide</line>
<line>Thy kingly doom and sentence of his pride.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. HEN.</speaker>
<line>Carlisle, this is your doom:</line>
<line>Choose out some secret place, some reverent room,</line>
<line>More than thou hast, and with it joy thy life.</line>
<line>So as thou liv&#8217;st in peace, die free from strife,</line>
<line>For though mine enemy thou hast ever been,</line>
<line>High sparks of honor in thee have I seen.</line>
</speech>
<stagedir>Enter Exton with Attendants bearing the coffin.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>EXTON.</speaker>
<line>Great King, within this coffin I present</line>
<line>Thy buried fear. Herein all breathless lies</line>
<line>The mightiest of thy greatest enemies,</line>
<line>Richard of Burdeaux, by me hither brought.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. HEN.</speaker>
<line>Exton, I thank thee not, for thou hast wrought</line>
<line>A deed of slander with thy fatal hand</line>
<line>Upon my head and all this famous land.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>EXTON.</speaker>
<line>From your own mouth, my lord, did I this deed.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. HEN.</speaker>
<line>They love not poison that do poison need,</line>
<line>Nor do I thee. Though I did wish him dead,</line>
<line>I hate the murderer, love him murdered.</line>
<line>The guilt of conscience take thou for thy labor,</line>
<line>But neither my good word nor princely favor.</line>
<line>With Cain go wander thorough shades of night,</line>
<line>And never show thy head by day nor light.</line>
<line>Lords, I protest my soul is full of woe</line>
<line>That blood should sprinkle me to make me grow.</line>
<line>Come mourn with me for what I do lament,</line>
<line>And put on sullen black incontinent.</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll make a voyage to the Holy Land,</line>
<line>To wash this blood off from my guilty hand.</line>
<line>March sadly after, grace my mournings here,</line>
<line>In weeping after this untimely bier.</line>
