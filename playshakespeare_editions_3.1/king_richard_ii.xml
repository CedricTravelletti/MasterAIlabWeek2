<SCENEPERSONAE>(King Richard, John of Gaunt, Nobles, Attendants, Bullingbrook, Mowbray)</SCENEPERSONAE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter King Richard, John of Gaunt, with other Nobles and Attendants.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Old John of Gaunt, time-honored Lancaster,</LINE>
<LINE>Hast thou, according to thy oath and band,</LINE>
<LINE>Brought hither Henry Herford thy bold son,</LINE>
<LINE>Here to make good the boist&#8217;rous late appeal,</LINE>
<LINE>Which then our leisure would not let us hear,</LINE>
<LINE>Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GAUNT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have, my liege.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tell me, moreover, hast thou sounded him,</LINE>
<LINE>If he appeal the Duke on ancient malice,</LINE>
<LINE>Or worthily, as a good subject should,</LINE>
<LINE>On some known ground of treachery in him?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GAUNT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As near as I could sift him on that argument,</LINE>
<LINE>On some apparent danger seen in him</LINE>
<LINE>Aim&#8217;d at your Highness, no inveterate malice.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then call them to our presence; face to face,</LINE>
<LINE>And frowning brow to brow, ourselves will hear</LINE>
<LINE>The accuser and the accused freely speak.</LINE>
<LINE>High-stomach&#8217;d are they both and full of ire,</LINE>
<LINE>In rage, deaf as the sea, hasty as fire.</LINE>
</SPEECH>
<STAGEDIR>Enter Bullingbrook and Mowbray with Attendants.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BULL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Many years of happy days befall</LINE>
<LINE>My gracious sovereign, my most loving liege!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MOW.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Each day still better other&#8217;s happiness,</LINE>
<LINE>Until the heavens, envying earth&#8217;s good hap,</LINE>
<LINE>Add an immortal title to your crown!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We thank you both, yet one but flatters us,</LINE>
<LINE>As well appeareth by the cause you come:</LINE>
<LINE>Namely, to appeal each other of high treason.</LINE>
<LINE>Cousin of Herford, what dost thou object</LINE>
<LINE>Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BULL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>First, heaven be the record to my speech,</LINE>
<LINE>In the devotion of a subject&#8217;s love,</LINE>
<LINE>Tend&#8217;ring the precious safety of my prince,</LINE>
<LINE>And free from other misbegotten hate,</LINE>
<LINE>Come I appellant to this princely presence.</LINE>
<LINE>Now, Thomas Mowbray, do I turn to thee,</LINE>
<LINE>And mark my greeting well; for what I speak</LINE>
<LINE>My body shall make good upon this earth,</LINE>
<LINE>Or my divine soul answer it in heaven.</LINE>
<LINE>Thou art a traitor and a miscreant,</LINE>
<LINE>Too good to be so, and too bad to live,</LINE>
<LINE>Since the more fair and crystal is the sky,</LINE>
<LINE>The uglier seem the clouds that in it fly.</LINE>
<LINE>Once more, the more to aggravate the note,</LINE>
<LINE>With a foul traitor&#8217;s name stuff I thy throat,</LINE>
<LINE>And wish (so please my sovereign) ere I move,</LINE>
<LINE>What my tongue speaks, my right drawn sword may prove.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MOW.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let not my cold words here accuse my zeal.</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis not the trial of a woman&#8217;s war,</LINE>
<LINE>The bitter clamor of two eager tongues,</LINE>
<LINE>Can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain;</LINE>
<LINE>The blood is hot that must be cool&#8217;d for this.</LINE>
<LINE>Yet can I not of such tame patience boast</LINE>
<LINE>As to be hush&#8217;d and nought at all to say.</LINE>
<LINE>First, the fair reverence of your Highness curbs me</LINE>
<LINE>From giving reins and spurs to my free speech,</LINE>
<LINE>Which else would post until it had return&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>These terms of treason doubled down his throat.</LINE>
<LINE>Setting aside his high blood&#8217;s royalty,</LINE>
<LINE>And let him be no kinsman to my liege,</LINE>
<LINE>I do defy him, and I spit at him,</LINE>
<LINE>Call him a slanderous coward, and a villain,</LINE>
<LINE>Which to maintain I would allow him odds</LINE>
<LINE>And meet him, were I tied to run afoot</LINE>
<LINE>Even to the frozen ridges of the Alps,</LINE>
<LINE>Or any other ground inhabitable</LINE>
<LINE>Where ever Englishman durst set his foot.</LINE>
<LINE>Mean time, let this defend my loyalty:</LINE>
<LINE>By all my hopes, most falsely doth he lie.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BULL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pale trembling coward, there I throw my gage,</LINE>
<LINE>Disclaiming here the kinred of the King,</LINE>
<LINE>And lay aside my high blood&#8217;s royalty,</LINE>
<LINE>Which fear, not reverence, makes thee to except.</LINE>
<LINE>If guilty dread have left thee so much strength</LINE>
<LINE>As to take up mine honor&#8217;s pawn, then stoop.</LINE>
<LINE>By that, and all the rites of knighthood else,</LINE>
<LINE>Will I make good against thee, arm to arm,</LINE>
<LINE>What I have spoke, or thou canst worse devise.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MOW.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I take it up, and by that sword I swear</LINE>
<LINE>Which gently laid my knighthood on my shoulder,</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll answer thee in any fair degree</LINE>
<LINE>Or chivalrous design of knightly trial;</LINE>
<LINE>And when I mount, alive may I not light,</LINE>
<LINE>If I be traitor or unjustly fight!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What doth our cousin lay to Mowbray&#8217;s charge?</LINE>
<LINE>It must be great that can inherit us</LINE>
<LINE>So much as of a thought of ill in him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BULL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Look what I speak, my life shall prove it true:</LINE>
<LINE>That Mowbray hath receiv&#8217;d eight thousand nobles</LINE>
<LINE>In name of lendings for your Highness&#8217; soldiers,</LINE>
<LINE>The which he hath detain&#8217;d for lewd employments,</LINE>
<LINE>Like a false traitor and injurious villain;</LINE>
<LINE>Besides I say, and will in battle prove,</LINE>
<LINE>Or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge</LINE>
<LINE>That ever was surveyed by English eye,</LINE>
<LINE>That all the treasons for these eighteen years,</LINE>
<LINE>Complotted and contrived in this land,</LINE>
<LINE>Fetch from false Mowbray their first head and spring.</LINE>
<LINE>Further I say, and further will maintain</LINE>
<LINE>Upon his bad life to make all this good,</LINE>
<LINE>That he did plot the Duke of Gloucester&#8217;s death,</LINE>
<LINE>Suggest his soon-believing adversaries,</LINE>
<LINE>And consequently, like a traitor coward,</LINE>
<LINE>Sluic&#8217;d out his innocent soul through streams of blood,</LINE>
<LINE>Which blood, like sacrificing Abel&#8217;s, cries,</LINE>
<LINE>Even from the tongueless caverns of the earth,</LINE>
<LINE>To me for justice and rough chastisement;</LINE>
<LINE>And, by the glorious worth of my descent,</LINE>
<LINE>This arm shall do it, or this life be spent.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How high a pitch his resolution soars!</LINE>
<LINE>Thomas of Norfolk, what say&#8217;st thou to this?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MOW.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, let my sovereign turn away his face,</LINE>
<LINE>And bid his ears a little while be deaf,</LINE>
<LINE>Till I have told this slander of his blood</LINE>
<LINE>How God and good men hate so foul a liar.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Mowbray, impartial are our eyes and ears.</LINE>
<LINE>Were he my brother, nay, my kingdom&#8217;s heir,</LINE>
<LINE>As he is but my father&#8217;s brother&#8217;s son,</LINE>
<LINE>Now by my sceptre&#8217;s awe I make a vow,</LINE>
<LINE>Such neighbor nearness to our sacred blood</LINE>
<LINE>Should nothing privilege him nor partialize</LINE>
<LINE>The unstooping firmness of my upright soul.</LINE>
<LINE>He is our subject, Mowbray; so art thou.</LINE>
<LINE>Free speech and fearless I to thee allow.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MOW.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then, Bullingbrook, as low as to thy heart</LINE>
<LINE>Through the false passage of thy throat thou liest.</LINE>
<LINE>Three parts of that receipt I had for Callice</LINE>
<LINE>Disburs&#8217;d I duly to his Highness&#8217; soldiers;</LINE>
<LINE>The other part reserv&#8217;d I by consent,</LINE>
<LINE>For that my sovereign liege was in my debt,</LINE>
<LINE>Upon remainder of a dear account,</LINE>
<LINE>Since last I went to France to fetch his queen.</LINE>
<LINE>Now swallow down that lie. For Gloucester&#8217;s death,</LINE>
<LINE>I slew him not, but to my own disgrace</LINE>
<LINE>Neglected my sworn duty in that case.</LINE>
<LINE>For you, my noble Lord of Lancaster,</LINE>
<LINE>The honorable father to my foe,</LINE>
<LINE>Once did I lay an ambush for your life,</LINE>
<LINE>A trespass that doth vex my grieved soul;</LINE>
<LINE>But ere I last receiv&#8217;d the sacrament</LINE>
<LINE>I did confess it, and exactly begg&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>Your Grace&#8217;s pardon, and I hope I had it.</LINE>
<LINE>This is my fault. As for the rest appeal&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>It issues from the rancor of a villain,</LINE>
<LINE>A recreant and most degenerate traitor,</LINE>
<LINE>Which in myself I boldly will defend,</LINE>
<LINE>And interchangeably hurl down my gage</LINE>
<LINE>Upon this overweening traitor&#8217;s foot,</LINE>
<LINE>To prove myself a loyal gentleman</LINE>
<LINE>Even in the best blood chamber&#8217;d in his bosom,</LINE>
<LINE>In haste whereof, most heartily I pray</LINE>
<LINE>Your Highness to assign our trial day.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Wrath-kindled gentlemen, be rul&#8217;d by me,</LINE>
<LINE>Let&#8217;s purge this choler without letting blood.</LINE>
<LINE>This we prescribe, though no physician;</LINE>
<LINE>Deep malice makes too deep incision.</LINE>
<LINE>Forget, forgive, conclude and be agreed,</LINE>
<LINE>Our doctors say this is no month to bleed.</LINE>
<LINE>Good uncle, let this end where it begun;</LINE>
<LINE>We&#8217;ll calm the Duke of Norfolk, you your son.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GAUNT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To be a make-peace shall become my age.</LINE>
<LINE>Throw down, my son, the Duke of Norfolk&#8217;s gage.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And, Norfolk, throw down his.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GAUNT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">When, Harry? When?</LINE>
<LINE>Obedience bids I should not bid again.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Norfolk, throw down, we bid, there is no boot.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MOW.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Myself I throw, dread sovereign, at thy foot,</LINE>
<LINE>My life thou shalt command, but not my shame:</LINE>
<LINE>The one my duty owes, but my fair name,</LINE>
<LINE>Despite of death that lives upon my grave,</LINE>
<LINE>To dark dishonor&#8217;s use thou shalt not have.</LINE>
<LINE>I am disgrac&#8217;d, impeach&#8217;d, and baffled here,</LINE>
<LINE>Pierc&#8217;d to the soul with slander&#8217;s venom&#8217;d spear,</LINE>
<LINE>The which no balm can cure but his heart-blood</LINE>
<LINE>Which breath&#8217;d this poison.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Rage must be withstood,</LINE>
<LINE>Give me his gage. Lions make leopards tame.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MOW.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yea, but not change his spots. Take but my shame,</LINE>
<LINE>And I resign my gage. My dear dear lord,</LINE>
<LINE>The purest treasure mortal times afford</LINE>
<LINE>Is spotless reputation; that away,</LINE>
<LINE>Men are but gilded loam or painted clay.</LINE>
<LINE>A jewel in a ten-times-barr&#8217;d-up chest</LINE>
<LINE>Is a bold spirit in a loyal breast.</LINE>
<LINE>Mine honor is my life, both grow in one,</LINE>
<LINE>Take honor from me, and my life is done.</LINE>
<LINE>Then, dear my liege, mine honor let me try;</LINE>
<LINE>In that I live, and for that will I die.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Cousin, throw up your gage, do you begin.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BULL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, God defend my soul from such deep sin!</LINE>
<LINE>Shall I seem crestfallen in my father&#8217;s sight?</LINE>
<LINE>Or with pale beggar-fear impeach my height</LINE>
<LINE>Before this outdar&#8217;d dastard? Ere my tongue</LINE>
<LINE>Shall wound my honor with such feeble wrong,</LINE>
<LINE>Or sound so base a parley, my teeth shall tear</LINE>
<LINE>The slavish motive of recanting fear,</LINE>
<LINE>And spit it bleeding in his high disgrace,</LINE>
<LINE>Where shame doth harbor, even in Mowbray&#8217;s face.</LINE>
</SPEECH>
<STAGEDIR>Exit Gaunt.</STAGEDIR>


<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We were not born to sue, but to command,</LINE>
<LINE>Which since we cannot do to make you friends,</LINE>
<LINE>Be ready, as your lives shall answer it,</LINE>
<LINE>At Coventry upon Saint Lambert&#8217;s day.</LINE>
<LINE>There shall your swords and lances arbitrate</LINE>
<LINE>The swelling difference of your settled hate.</LINE>
<LINE>Since we cannot atone you, we shall see</LINE>
<LINE>Justice design the victor&#8217;s chivalry.</LINE>
<LINE>Lord Marshal, command our officers-at-arms</LINE>
<LINE>Be ready to direct these home alarms.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GAUNT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alas, the part I had in Woodstock&#8217;s blood</LINE>
<LINE>Doth more solicit me than your exclaims</LINE>
<LINE>To stir against the butchers of his life!</LINE>
<LINE>But since correction lieth in those hands</LINE>
<LINE>Which made the fault that we cannot correct,</LINE>
<LINE>Put we our quarrel to the will of heaven,</LINE>
<LINE>Who, when they see the hour&#8217;s ripe on earth,</LINE>
<LINE>Will rain hot vengeance on offenders&#8217; heads.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUCH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Finds brotherhood in thee no sharper spur?</LINE>
<LINE>Hath love in thy old blood no living fire?</LINE>
<LINE>Edward&#8217;s seven sons, whereof thyself art one,</LINE>
<LINE>Were as seven vials of his sacred blood,</LINE>
<LINE>Or seven fair branches springing from one root.</LINE>
<LINE>Some of those seven are dried by nature&#8217;s course,</LINE>
<LINE>Some of those branches by the Destinies cut;</LINE>
<LINE>But Thomas, my dear lord, my life, my Gloucester,</LINE>
<LINE>One vial full of Edward&#8217;s sacred blood,</LINE>
<LINE>One flourishing branch of his most royal root,</LINE>
<LINE>Is crack&#8217;d, and all the precious liquor spilt,</LINE>
<LINE>Is hack&#8217;d down, and his summer leaves all faded,</LINE>
<LINE>By envy&#8217;s hand and murder&#8217;s bloody axe.</LINE>
<LINE>Ah, Gaunt, his blood was thine! That bed, that womb,</LINE>
<LINE>That mettle, that self mould, that fashioned thee</LINE>
<LINE>Made him a man; and though thou livest and breathest,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet art thou slain in him. Thou dost consent</LINE>
<LINE>In some large measure to thy father&#8217;s death,</LINE>
<LINE>In that thou seest thy wretched brother die,</LINE>
<LINE>Who was the model of thy father&#8217;s life.</LINE>
<LINE>Call it not patience, Gaunt, it is despair.</LINE>
<LINE>In suff&#8217;ring thus thy brother to be slaught&#8217;red,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou showest the naked pathway to thy life,</LINE>
<LINE>Teaching stern murder how to butcher thee.</LINE>
<LINE>That which in mean men we entitle patience</LINE>
<LINE>Is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts.</LINE>
<LINE>What shall I say? To safeguard thine own life</LINE>
<LINE>The best way is to venge my Gloucester&#8217;s death.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GAUNT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>God&#8217;s is the quarrel, for God&#8217;s substitute,</LINE>
<LINE>His deputy anointed in His sight,</LINE>
<LINE>Hath caus&#8217;d his death, the which if wrongfully,</LINE>
<LINE>Let heaven revenge, for I may never lift</LINE>
<LINE>An angry arm against His minister.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUCH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why then I will. Farewell, old Gaunt!</LINE>
<LINE>Thou goest to Coventry, there to behold</LINE>
<LINE>Our cousin Herford and fell Mowbray fight.</LINE>
<LINE>O, sit my husband&#8217;s wrongs on Herford&#8217;s spear,</LINE>
<LINE>That it may enter butcher Mowbray&#8217;s breast!</LINE>
<LINE>Or if misfortune miss the first career,</LINE>
<LINE>Be Mowbray&#8217;s sins so heavy in his bosom</LINE>
<LINE>That they may break his foaming courser&#8217;s back,</LINE>
<LINE>And throw the rider headlong in the lists,</LINE>
<LINE>A caitive recreant to my cousin Herford!</LINE>
<LINE>Farewell, old Gaunt! Thy sometimes brother&#8217;s wife</LINE>
<LINE>With her companion, grief, must end her life.</LINE>

<LINE>Yet one word more! Grief boundeth where it falls,</LINE>
<LINE>Not with the empty hollowness, but weight.</LINE>
<LINE>I take my leave before I have begun,</LINE>
<LINE>For sorrow ends not when it seemeth done.</LINE>
<LINE>Commend me to thy brother, Edmund York.</LINE>
<LINE>Lo this is all&#8212;nay, yet depart not so;</LINE>
<LINE>Though this be all, do not so quickly go;</LINE>
<LINE>I shall remember more. Bid him&#8212;ah, what?&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>With all good speed at Plashy visit me.</LINE>
<LINE>Alack, and what shall good old York there see</LINE>
<LINE>But empty lodgings and unfurnish&#8217;d walls,</LINE>
<LINE>Unpeopled offices, untrodden stones?</LINE>
<LINE>And what hear there for welcome but my groans?</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore commend me; let him not come there</LINE>
<LINE>To seek out sorrow that dwells every where.</LINE>
<LINE>Desolate, desolate, will I hence and die:</LINE>

<LINE>A traitor to my God, my king, and me&#8212;</LINE>

<SPEAKER>BULL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Harry of Herford, Lancaster, and Derby</LINE>

<LINE>To prove by God&#8217;s grace, and my body&#8217;s valor,</LINE>
<LINE>In lists, on Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BULL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Lord Marshal, let me kiss my sovereign&#8217;s hand</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BULL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, let no noble eye profane a tear</LINE>
<LINE>For me, if I be gor&#8217;d with Mowbray&#8217;s spear.</LINE>
<LINE>As confident as is the falcon&#8217;s flight</LINE>
<LINE>Against a bird, do I with Mowbray fight.</LINE>
<LINE>My loving lord, I take my leave of you;</LINE>
<LINE>Of you, my noble cousin, Lord Aumerle;</LINE>
<LINE>Not sick, although I have to do with death,</LINE>

<LINE>The daintiest last, to make the end most sweet:</LINE>
<LINE>O thou, the earthly author of my blood,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose youthful spirit, in me regenerate,</LINE>
<LINE>Doth with a twofold vigor lift me up</LINE>
<LINE>To reach at victory above my head,</LINE>
<LINE>Add proof unto mine armor with thy prayers,</LINE>
<LINE>And with thy blessings steel my lance&#8217;s point,</LINE>
<LINE>That it may enter Mowbray&#8217;s waxen coat,</LINE>
<LINE>And furbish new the name of John a&#8217; Gaunt,</LINE>
<LINE>Even in the lusty havior of his son.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>However God or fortune cast my lot,</LINE>
<LINE>There lives or dies, true to King Richard&#8217;s throne,</LINE>
<LINE>A loyal, just, and upright gentleman.</LINE>
<LINE>Never did captive with a freer heart</LINE>
<LINE>Cast off his chains of bondage, and embrace</LINE>
<LINE>His golden uncontroll&#8217;d enfranchisement,</LINE>
<LINE>More than my dancing soul doth celebrate</LINE>
<LINE>This feast of battle with mine adversary.</LINE>
<LINE>Most mighty liege, and my companion peers,</LINE>
<LINE>Take from my mouth the wish of happy years.</LINE>
<LINE>As gentle and as jocund as to jest</LINE>

<LINE>On pain to be found false and recreant,</LINE>
<LINE>To prove the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray,</LINE>
<LINE>A traitor to his God, his king, and him,</LINE>
<LINE>And dares him to set forward to the fight.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. HER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here standeth Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk,</LINE>
<LINE>On pain to be found false and recreant,</LINE>

<LINE>Henry of Herford, Lancaster, and Derby</LINE>
<LINE>To God, his sovereign, and to him disloyal,</LINE>
<LINE>Courageously, and with a free desire,</LINE>

<LINE>Sound, trumpets, and set forward, combatants.</LINE>

<LINE>Stay, the King hath thrown his warder down.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let them lay by their helmets and their spears,</LINE>
<LINE>And both return back to their chairs again.</LINE>
<LINE>Withdraw with us, and let the trumpets sound</LINE>
<LINE>While we return these dukes what we decree.</LINE>


<STAGEDIR>A long flourish.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Draw near,</LINE>
<LINE>And list what with our Council we have done:</LINE>
<LINE>For that our kingdom&#8217;s earth should not be soil&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>With that dear blood which it hath fostered;</LINE>
<LINE>And for our eyes do hate the dire aspect</LINE>
<LINE>Of civil wounds plough&#8217;d up with neighbors&#8217; sword;</LINE>
<LINE>And for we think the eagle-winged pride</LINE>
<LINE>Of sky-aspiring and ambitious thoughts,</LINE>
<LINE>With rival-hating envy, set on you</LINE>
<LINE>To wake our peace, which in our country&#8217;s cradle</LINE>
<LINE>Draws the sweet infant breath of gentle sleep;</LINE>
<LINE>Which so rous&#8217;d up with boist&#8217;rous untun&#8217;d drums,</LINE>
<LINE>With harsh-resounding trumpets&#8217; dreadful bray,</LINE>
<LINE>And grating shock of wrathful iron arms,</LINE>
<LINE>Might from our quiet confines fright fair peace,</LINE>
<LINE>And make us wade even in our kinred&#8217;s blood:</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore we banish you our territories.</LINE>
<LINE>You, cousin Herford, upon pain of life,</LINE>
<LINE>Till twice five summers have enrich&#8217;d our fields</LINE>
<LINE>Shall not regreet our fair dominions,</LINE>
<LINE>But tread the stranger paths of banishment.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BULL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your will be done. This must my comfort be,</LINE>
<LINE>That sun that warms you here shall shine on me,</LINE>
<LINE>And those his golden beams to you here lent</LINE>
<LINE>Shall point on me and gild my banishment.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Norfolk, for thee remains a heavier doom,</LINE>
<LINE>Which I with same unwillingness pronounce:</LINE>
<LINE>The sly, slow hours shall not determinate</LINE>
<LINE>The dateless limit of thy dear exile;</LINE>
<LINE>The hopeless word of &#8220;never to return&#8221;</LINE>
<LINE>Breathe I against thee, upon pain of life.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MOW.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A heavy sentence, my most sovereign liege,</LINE>
<LINE>And all unlook&#8217;d for from your Highness&#8217; mouth.</LINE>
<LINE>A dearer merit, not so deep a maim</LINE>
<LINE>As to be cast forth in the common air,</LINE>
<LINE>Have I deserved at your Highness&#8217; hands.</LINE>
<LINE>The language I have learnt these forty years,</LINE>
<LINE>My native English, now I must forgo,</LINE>
<LINE>And now my tongue&#8217;s use is to me no more</LINE>
<LINE>Than an unstringed viol or a harp,</LINE>
<LINE>Or like a cunning instrument cas&#8217;d up,</LINE>
<LINE>Or being open, put into his hands</LINE>
<LINE>That knows no touch to tune the harmony.</LINE>
<LINE>Within my mouth you have enjail&#8217;d my tongue,</LINE>
<LINE>Doubly portcullis&#8217;d with my teeth and lips,</LINE>
<LINE>And dull unfeeling barren ignorance</LINE>
<LINE>Is made my jailer to attend on me.</LINE>
<LINE>I am too old to fawn upon a nurse,</LINE>
<LINE>Too far in years to be a pupil now.</LINE>
<LINE>What is thy sentence then but speechless death,</LINE>
<LINE>Which robs my tongue from breathing native breath?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It boots thee not to be compassionate,</LINE>
<LINE>After our sentence plaining comes too late.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MOW.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then thus I turn me from my country&#8217;s light,</LINE>
<LINE>To dwell in solemn shades of endless night.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Return again, and take an oath with thee.</LINE>
<LINE>Lay on our royal sword your banish&#8217;d hands;</LINE>
<LINE>Swear by the duty that y&#8217; owe to God</LINE>
<LINE>(Our part therein we banish with yourselves)</LINE>
<LINE>To keep the oath that we administer:</LINE>
<LINE>You never shall, so help you truth and God,</LINE>
<LINE>Embrace each other&#8217;s love in banishment,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor never look upon each other&#8217;s face,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor never write, regreet, nor reconcile</LINE>
<LINE>This low&#8217;ring tempest of your home-bred hate,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor never by advised purpose meet</LINE>
<LINE>To plot, contrive, or complot any ill</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Gainst us, our state, our subjects, or our land.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BULL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I swear.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MOW.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And I, to keep all this.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BULL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Norfolk, so fare as to mine enemy:</LINE>
<LINE>By this time, had the King permitted us,</LINE>
<LINE>One of our souls had wand&#8217;red in the air,</LINE>
<LINE>Banish&#8217;d this frail sepulchre of our flesh,</LINE>
<LINE>As now our flesh is banish&#8217;d from this land;</LINE>
<LINE>Confess thy treasons ere thou fly the realm;</LINE>
<LINE>Since thou hast far to go, bear not along</LINE>
<LINE>The clogging burden of a guilty soul.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MOW.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, Bullingbrook, if ever I were traitor,</LINE>
<LINE>My name be blotted from the book of life,</LINE>
<LINE>And I from heaven banish&#8217;d as from hence!</LINE>
<LINE>But what thou art, God, thou, and I do know,</LINE>
<LINE>And all too soon, I fear, the King shall rue.</LINE>
<LINE>Farewell, my liege, now no way can I stray;</LINE>
<LINE>Save back to England, all the world&#8217;s my way.</LINE>
</SPEECH>
<STAGEDIR>Exit.</STAGEDIR>


<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Uncle, even in the glasses of thine eyes</LINE>
<LINE>I see thy grieved heart. Thy sad aspect</LINE>
<LINE>Hath from the number of his banish&#8217;d years</LINE>
<LINE>Pluck&#8217;d four away.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>To Bullingbrook.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE offset="4">Six frozen winters spent,</LINE>
<LINE>Return with welcome home from banishment.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BULL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How long a time lies in one little word!</LINE>
<LINE>Four lagging winters and four wanton springs</LINE>
<LINE>End in a word: such is the breath of kings.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GAUNT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I thank my liege that in regard of me</LINE>
<LINE>He shortens four years of my son&#8217;s exile,</LINE>
<LINE>But little vantage shall I reap thereby;</LINE>
<LINE>For ere the six years that he hath to spend</LINE>
<LINE>Can change their moons and bring their times about,</LINE>
<LINE>My oil-dried lamp and time-bewasted light</LINE>
<LINE>Shall be extinct with age and endless night;</LINE>
<LINE>My inch of taper will be burnt and done,</LINE>
<LINE>And blindfold Death not let me see my son.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, uncle, thou hast many years to live.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GAUNT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But not a minute, King, that thou canst give.</LINE>
<LINE>Shorten my days thou canst with sullen sorrow,</LINE>
<LINE>And pluck nights from me, but not lend a morrow;</LINE>
<LINE>Thou canst help time to furrow me with age,</LINE>
<LINE>But stop no wrinkle in his pilgrimage;</LINE>
<LINE>Thy word is current with him for my death,</LINE>
<LINE>But dead, thy kingdom cannot buy my breath.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thy son is banish&#8217;d upon good advice,</LINE>
<LINE>Whereto thy tongue a party-verdict gave.</LINE>
<LINE>Why at our justice seem&#8217;st thou then to low&#8217;r?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GAUNT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Things sweet to taste prove in digestion sour.</LINE>
<LINE>You urg&#8217;d me as a judge, but I had rather</LINE>
<LINE>You would have bid me argue like a father.</LINE>
<LINE>O, had&#8217;t been a stranger, not my child,</LINE>
<LINE>To smooth his fault I should have been more mild.</LINE>
<LINE>A partial slander sought I to avoid,</LINE>
<LINE>And in the sentence my own life destroyed.</LINE>
<LINE>Alas, I look&#8217;d when some of you should say</LINE>
<LINE>I was too strict to make mine own away;</LINE>
<LINE>But you gave leave to my unwilling tongue</LINE>
<LINE>Against my will to do myself this wrong.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Cousin, farewell; and, uncle, bid him so.</LINE>
<LINE>Six years we banish him, and he shall go.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Flourish. Exit with his Train.</STAGEDIR>


<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Cousin, farewell! What presence must not know,</LINE>

<LINE>My lord, no leave take I, for I will ride,</LINE>
<LINE>As far as land will let me, by your side.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GAUNT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, to what purpose dost thou hoard thy words,</LINE>
<LINE>That thou returnest no greeting to thy friends?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BULL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have too few to take my leave of you,</LINE>
<LINE>When the tongue&#8217;s office should be prodigal</LINE>
<LINE>To breathe the abundant dolor of the heart.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GAUNT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thy grief is but thy absence for a time.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BULL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Joy absent, grief is present for that time.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GAUNT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What is six winters? They are quickly gone.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BULL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To men in joy, but grief makes one hour ten.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GAUNT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Call it a travel that thou tak&#8217;st for pleasure.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BULL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My heart will sigh when I miscall it so,</LINE>
<LINE>Which finds it an enforced pilgrimage.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GAUNT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The sullen passage of thy weary steps</LINE>
<LINE>Esteem as foil wherein thou art to set</LINE>
<LINE>The precious jewel of thy home return.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BULL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay rather, every tedious stride I make</LINE>
<LINE>Will but remember me what a deal of world</LINE>
<LINE>I wander from the jewels that I love.</LINE>
<LINE>Must I not serve a long apprenticehood</LINE>
<LINE>To foreign passages, and in the end,</LINE>
<LINE>Having my freedom, boast of nothing else</LINE>
<LINE>But that I was a journeyman to grief?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GAUNT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>All places that the eye of heaven visits</LINE>
<LINE>Are to a wise man ports and happy havens.</LINE>
<LINE>Teach thy necessity to reason thus:</LINE>
<LINE>There is no virtue like necessity.</LINE>
<LINE>Think not the King did banish thee,</LINE>
<LINE>But thou the King. Woe doth the heavier sit</LINE>
<LINE>Where it perceives it is but faintly borne.</LINE>
<LINE>Go, say I sent thee forth to purchase honor,</LINE>
<LINE>And not the King exil&#8217;d thee; or suppose</LINE>
<LINE>Devouring pestilence hangs in our air,</LINE>
<LINE>And thou art flying to a fresher clime.</LINE>
<LINE>Look what thy soul holds dear, imagine it</LINE>
<LINE>To lie that way thou goest, not whence thou com&#8217;st.</LINE>
<LINE>Suppose the singing birds musicians,</LINE>
<LINE>The grass whereon thou tread&#8217;st the presence strow&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>The flowers fair ladies, and thy steps no more</LINE>
<LINE>Than a delightful measure or a dance,</LINE>
<LINE>For gnarling sorrow hath less power to bite</LINE>
<LINE>The man that mocks at it and sets it light.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BULL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, who can hold a fire in his hand</LINE>
<LINE>By thinking on the frosty Caucasus?</LINE>
<LINE>Or cloy the hungry edge of appetite</LINE>
<LINE>By bare imagination of a feast?</LINE>
<LINE>Or wallow naked in December snow</LINE>
<LINE>By thinking on fantastic summer&#8217;s heat?</LINE>
<LINE>O no, the apprehension of the good</LINE>
<LINE>Gives but the greater feeling to the worse.</LINE>
<LINE>Fell Sorrow&#8217;s tooth doth never rankle more</LINE>
<LINE>Than when he bites, but lanceth not the sore.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GAUNT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, come, my son, I&#8217;ll bring thee on thy way;</LINE>
<LINE>Had I thy youth and cause, I would not stay.</LINE>

<LINE>We did observe. Cousin Aumerle,</LINE>
<LINE>How far brought you high Herford on his way?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I brought high Herford, if you call him so,</LINE>
<LINE>But to the next high way, and there I left him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And say, what store of parting tears were shed?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Faith, none for me, except the northeast wind,</LINE>
<LINE>Which then blew bitterly against our faces,</LINE>
<LINE>Awak&#8217;d the sleeping rheum, and so by chance</LINE>
<LINE>Did grace our hollow parting with a tear.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What said our cousin when you parted with him?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8220;Farewell!&#8221;</LINE>
<LINE>And for my heart disdained that my tongue</LINE>
<LINE>Should so profane the word, that taught me craft</LINE>
<LINE>To counterfeit oppression of such grief</LINE>
<LINE>That words seem&#8217;d buried in my sorrow&#8217;s grave.</LINE>
<LINE>Marry, would the word &#8220;farewell&#8221; have length&#8217;ned hours</LINE>
<LINE>And added years to his short banishment,</LINE>
<LINE>He should have had a volume of farewells;</LINE>
<LINE>But since it would not, he had none of me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He is our cousin&#8217;s cousin, but &#8217;tis doubt,</LINE>
<LINE>When time shall call him home from banishment,</LINE>
<LINE>Whether our kinsman come to see his friends.</LINE>
<LINE>Ourself and Bushy, Bagot here and Green,</LINE>
<LINE>Observ&#8217;d his courtship to the common people,</LINE>
<LINE>How he did seem to dive into their hearts</LINE>
<LINE>With humble and familiar courtesy,</LINE>
<LINE>What reverence he did throw away on slaves,</LINE>
<LINE>Wooing poor craftsmen with the craft of smiles</LINE>
<LINE>And patient underbearing of his fortune,</LINE>
<LINE>As &#8217;twere to banish their affects with him.</LINE>
<LINE>Off goes his bonnet to an oyster-wench,</LINE>
<LINE>A brace of draymen bid God speed him well,</LINE>
<LINE>And had the tribute of his supple knee,</LINE>
<LINE>With &#8220;Thanks, my countrymen, my loving friends,&#8221;</LINE>

<LINE>We are enforc&#8217;d to farm our royal realm,</LINE>
<LINE>The revenue whereof shall furnish us</LINE>
<LINE>For our affairs in hand. If that come short,</LINE>
<LINE>Our substitutes at home shall have blank charters,</LINE>

<SPEAKER>GAUNT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Will the King come, that I may breathe my last</LINE>
<LINE>In wholesome counsel to his unstayed youth?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Vex not yourself, nor strive not with your breath,</LINE>
<LINE>For all in vain comes counsel to his ear.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GAUNT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O but they say the tongues of dying men</LINE>
<LINE>Enforce attention like deep harmony.</LINE>
<LINE>Where words are scarce, they are seldom spent in vain,</LINE>
<LINE>For they breathe truth that breathe their words in pain.</LINE>
<LINE>He that no more must say is listened more</LINE>
<LINE>Than they whom youth and ease have taught to glose.</LINE>
<LINE>More are men&#8217;s ends mark&#8217;d than their lives before.</LINE>
<LINE>The setting sun, and music at the close,</LINE>
<LINE>As the last taste of sweets, is sweetest last,</LINE>
<LINE>Writ in remembrance more than things long past.</LINE>
<LINE>Though Richard my live&#8217;s counsel would not hear,</LINE>
<LINE>My death&#8217;s sad tale may yet undeaf his ear.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, it is stopp&#8217;d with other flattering sounds,</LINE>
<LINE>As praises, of whose taste the wise are fond,</LINE>
<LINE>Lascivious metres, to whose venom sound</LINE>
<LINE>The open ear of youth doth always listen;</LINE>
<LINE>Report of fashions in proud Italy,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose manners still our tardy, apish nation</LINE>
<LINE>Limps after in base imitation.</LINE>
<LINE>Where doth the world thrust forth a vanity&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>So it be new, there&#8217;s no respect how vile&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>That is not quickly buzz&#8217;d into his ears?</LINE>
<LINE>Then all too late comes counsel to be heard,</LINE>
<LINE>Where will doth mutiny with wit&#8217;s regard.</LINE>
<LINE>Direct not him whose way himself will choose,</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis breath thou lack&#8217;st, and that breath wilt thou lose.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GAUNT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Methinks I am a prophet new inspir&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>And thus expiring do foretell of him:</LINE>
<LINE>His rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last,</LINE>
<LINE>For violent fires soon burn out themselves;</LINE>
<LINE>Small show&#8217;rs last long, but sudden storms are short;</LINE>
<LINE>He tires betimes that spurs too fast betimes;</LINE>
<LINE>With eager feeding food doth choke the feeder;</LINE>
<LINE>Light vanity, insatiate cormorant,</LINE>
<LINE>Consuming means, soon preys upon itself.</LINE>
<LINE>This royal throne of kings, this sceptred isle,</LINE>
<LINE>This earth of majesty, this seat of Mars,</LINE>
<LINE>This other Eden, demi-paradise,</LINE>
<LINE>This fortress built by Nature for herself</LINE>
<LINE>Against infection and the hand of war,</LINE>
<LINE>This happy breed of men, this little world,</LINE>
<LINE>This precious stone set in the silver sea,</LINE>
<LINE>Which serves it in the office of a wall,</LINE>
<LINE>Or as a moat defensive to a house,</LINE>
<LINE>Against the envy of less happier lands;</LINE>
<LINE>This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England,</LINE>
<LINE>This nurse, this teeming womb of royal kings,</LINE>
<LINE>Fear&#8217;d by their breed, and famous by their birth,</LINE>
<LINE>Renowned for their deeds as far from home,</LINE>
<LINE>For Christian service and true chivalry,</LINE>
<LINE>As is the sepulchre in stubborn Jewry</LINE>
<LINE>Of the world&#8217;s ransom, blessed Mary&#8217;s Son;</LINE>
<LINE>This land of such dear souls, this dear dear land,</LINE>
<LINE>Dear for her reputation through the world,</LINE>
<LINE>Is now leas&#8217;d out&#8212;I die pronouncing it&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Like to a tenement or pelting farm.</LINE>
<LINE>England, bound in with the triumphant sea,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose rocky shore beats back the envious siege</LINE>
<LINE>Of wat&#8217;ry Neptune, is now bound in with shame,</LINE>
<LINE>With inky blots and rotten parchment bonds;</LINE>
<LINE>That England, that was wont to conquer others,</LINE>
<LINE>Hath made a shameful conquest of itself.</LINE>
<LINE>Ah, would the scandal vanish with my life,</LINE>
<LINE>How happy then were my ensuing death!</LINE>
</SPEECH>
<STAGEDIR>Enter King and Queen, etc.&#8212;Aumerle, Bushy, Green, Bagot, Ross, and Willoughby.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The King is come. Deal mildly with his youth,</LINE>
<LINE>For young hot colts being rag&#8217;d do rage the more.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How fares our noble uncle Lancaster?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What comfort, man? How is&#8217;t with aged Gaunt?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GAUNT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O how that name befits my composition!</LINE>
<LINE>Old Gaunt indeed, and gaunt in being old.</LINE>
<LINE>Within me grief hath kept a tedious fast;</LINE>
<LINE>And who abstains from meat that is not gaunt?</LINE>
<LINE>For sleeping England long time have I watch&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Watching breeds leanness, leanness is all gaunt.</LINE>
<LINE>The pleasure that some fathers feed upon</LINE>
<LINE>Is my strict fast&#8212;I mean, my children&#8217;s looks;</LINE>
<LINE>And therein fasting, hast thou made me gaunt.</LINE>
<LINE>Gaunt am I for the grave, gaunt as a grave,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose hollow womb inherits nought but bones.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Can sick men play so nicely with their names?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GAUNT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, misery makes sport to mock itself:</LINE>
<LINE>Since thou dost seek to kill my name in me,</LINE>
<LINE>I mock my name, great King, to flatter thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Should dying men flatter with those that live?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GAUNT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, no, men living flatter those that die.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou, now a-dying, sayest thou flatterest me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GAUNT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O no, thou diest, though I the sicker be.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am in health, I breathe, and see thee ill.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GAUNT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now He that made me knows I see thee ill,</LINE>
<LINE>Ill in myself to see, and in thee, seeing ill.</LINE>
<LINE>Thy death-bed is no lesser than thy land,</LINE>
<LINE>Wherein thou liest in reputation sick,</LINE>
<LINE>And thou, too careless patient as thou art,</LINE>
<LINE>Commit&#8217;st thy anointed body to the cure</LINE>
<LINE>Of those physicians that first wounded thee.</LINE>
<LINE>A thousand flatterers sit within thy crown,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose compass is no bigger than thy head,</LINE>
<LINE>And yet, incaged in so small a verge,</LINE>
<LINE>The waste is no whit lesser than thy land.</LINE>
<LINE>O had thy grandsire with a prophet&#8217;s eye</LINE>
<LINE>Seen how his son&#8217;s son should destroy his sons,</LINE>
<LINE>From forth thy reach he would have laid thy shame,</LINE>
<LINE>Deposing thee before thou wert possess&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Which art possess&#8217;d now to depose thyself.</LINE>
<LINE>Why, cousin, wert thou regent of the world,</LINE>
<LINE>It were a shame to let this land by lease;</LINE>
<LINE>But for thy world enjoying but this land,</LINE>
<LINE>Is it not more than shame to shame it so?</LINE>
<LINE>Landlord of England art thou now, not king,</LINE>
<LINE>Thy state of law is bond-slave to the law,</LINE>
<LINE>And thou&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="3">A lunatic lean-witted fool,</LINE>
<LINE>Presuming on an ague&#8217;s privilege,</LINE>
<LINE>Darest with thy frozen admonition</LINE>
<LINE>Make pale our cheek, chasing the royal blood</LINE>
<LINE>With fury from his native residence.</LINE>
<LINE>Now by my seat&#8217;s right royal majesty,</LINE>
<LINE>Wert thou not brother to great Edward&#8217;s son,</LINE>
<LINE>This tongue that runs so roundly in thy head</LINE>
<LINE>Should run thy head from thy unreverent shoulders.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GAUNT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, spare me not, my brother Edward&#8217;s son,</LINE>
<LINE>For that I was his father Edward&#8217;s son,</LINE>
<LINE>That blood already, like the pelican,</LINE>
<LINE>Hast thou tapp&#8217;d out and drunkenly carous&#8217;d.</LINE>
<LINE>My brother Gloucester, plain well-meaning soul,</LINE>
<LINE>Whom fair befall in heaven &#8217;mongst happy souls,</LINE>
<LINE>May be a president and witness good</LINE>
<LINE>That thou respect&#8217;st not spilling Edward&#8217;s blood.</LINE>
<LINE>Join with the present sickness that I have,</LINE>
<LINE>And thy unkindness be like crooked age,</LINE>
<LINE>To crop at once a too long withered flower.</LINE>
<LINE>Live in thy shame, but die not shame with thee!</LINE>
<LINE>These words hereafter thy tormentors be!</LINE>
<LINE>Convey me to my bed, then to my grave;</LINE>
<LINE>Love they to live that love and honor have.</LINE>
</SPEECH>
<STAGEDIR>Exit, borne off by his Attendants.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And let them die that age and sullens have,</LINE>
<LINE>For both hast thou, and both become the grave.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do beseech your Majesty, impute his words</LINE>
<LINE>To wayward sickliness and age in him.</LINE>
<LINE>He loves you, on my life, and holds you dear</LINE>
<LINE>As Harry Duke of Herford, were he here.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Right, you say true: as Herford&#8217;s love, so his,</LINE>
<LINE>As theirs, so mine, and all be as it is.</LINE>
</SPEECH>
<STAGEDIR>Enter Northumberland.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NORTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My liege, old Gaunt commends him to your Majesty.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What says he?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NORTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="3">Nay, nothing, all is said.</LINE>
<LINE>His tongue is now a stringless instrument,</LINE>
<LINE>Words, life, and all, old Lancaster hath spent.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Be York the next that must be bankrout so!</LINE>
<LINE>Though death be poor, it ends a mortal woe.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The ripest fruit first falls, and so doth he;</LINE>
<LINE>His time is spent, our pilgrimage must be.</LINE>
<LINE>So much for that. Now for our Irish wars:</LINE>
<LINE>We must supplant those rough rug-headed kerns,</LINE>
<LINE>Which live like venom where no venom else</LINE>
<LINE>But only they have privilege to live.</LINE>
<LINE>And, for these great affairs do ask some charge,</LINE>
<LINE>Towards our assistance we do seize to us</LINE>
<LINE>The plate, coin, revenues, and moveables</LINE>
<LINE>Whereof our uncle Gaunt did stand possess&#8217;d.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How long shall I be patient? Ah, how long</LINE>
<LINE>Shall tender duty make me suffer wrong?</LINE>
<LINE>Not Gloucester&#8217;s death, nor Herford&#8217;s banishment,</LINE>
<LINE>Not Gaunt&#8217;s rebukes, nor England&#8217;s private wrongs,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor the prevention of poor Bullingbrook</LINE>
<LINE>About his marriage, nor my own disgrace,</LINE>
<LINE>Have ever made me sour my patient cheek,</LINE>
<LINE>Or bend one wrinkle on my sovereign&#8217;s face.</LINE>
<LINE>I am the last of noble Edward&#8217;s sons,</LINE>
<LINE>Of whom thy father, Prince of Wales, was first.</LINE>
<LINE>In war was never lion rag&#8217;d more fierce,</LINE>
<LINE>In peace was never gentle lamb more mild,</LINE>
<LINE>Than was that young and princely gentleman.</LINE>
<LINE>His face thou hast, for even so look&#8217;d he,</LINE>
<LINE>Accomplish&#8217;d with the number of thy hours;</LINE>
<LINE>But when he frowned it was against the French,</LINE>
<LINE>And not against his friends. His noble hand</LINE>
<LINE>Did win what he did spend, and spent not that</LINE>
<LINE>Which his triumphant father&#8217;s hand had won.</LINE>
<LINE>His hands were guilty of no kinred blood,</LINE>
<LINE>But bloody with the enemies of his kin.</LINE>
<LINE>O Richard! York is too far gone with grief,</LINE>
<LINE>Or else he never would compare between.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, uncle, what&#8217;s the matter?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">O my liege,</LINE>
<LINE>Pardon me, if you please; if not, I, pleas&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>Not to be pardoned, am content withal.</LINE>
<LINE>Seek you to seize and gripe into your hands</LINE>
<LINE>The royalties and rights of banish&#8217;d Herford?</LINE>
<LINE>Is not Gaunt dead? And doth not Herford live?</LINE>
<LINE>Was not Gaunt just? And is not Harry true?</LINE>
<LINE>Did not the one deserve to have an heir?</LINE>
<LINE>Is not his heir a well-deserving son?</LINE>
<LINE>Take Herford&#8217;s rights away, and take from Time</LINE>
<LINE>His charters and his customary rights;</LINE>
<LINE>Let not tomorrow then ensue today;</LINE>
<LINE>Be not thyself; for how art thou a king</LINE>
<LINE>But by fair sequence and succession?</LINE>
<LINE>Now afore God&#8212;God forbid I say true!&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>If you do wrongfully seize Herford&#8217;s rights,</LINE>
<LINE>Call in the letters-patents that he hath</LINE>
<LINE>By his attorneys-general to sue</LINE>
<LINE>His livery, and deny his off&#8217;red homage,</LINE>
<LINE>You pluck a thousand dangers on your head,</LINE>
<LINE>You lose a thousand well-disposed hearts,</LINE>
<LINE>And prick my tender patience to those thoughts</LINE>
<LINE>Which honor and allegiance cannot think.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Think what you will, we seize into our hands</LINE>
<LINE>His plate, his goods, his money, and his lands.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll not be by the while. My liege, farewell!</LINE>
<LINE>What will ensue hereof, there&#8217;s none can tell;</LINE>
<LINE>But by bad courses may be understood</LINE>
<LINE>That their events can never fall out good.</LINE>
</SPEECH>
<STAGEDIR>Exit.</STAGEDIR>


<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go, Bushy, to the Earl of Wiltshire straight,</LINE>
<LINE>Bid him repair to us to Ely House</LINE>
<LINE>To see this business. Tomorrow next</LINE>
<LINE>We will for Ireland, and &#8217;tis time, I trow.</LINE>
<LINE>And we create, in absence of ourself,</LINE>
<LINE>Our uncle York lord governor of England;</LINE>
<LINE>For he is just and always loved us well.</LINE>
<LINE>Come on, our queen, tomorrow must we part.</LINE>
<LINE>Be merry, for our time of stay is short.</LINE>
</SPEECH>
<STAGEDIR>Flourish. Exeunt King and Queen with others. Manet Northumberland with Willoughby and Ross.</STAGEDIR>


<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NORTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, lords, the Duke of Lancaster is dead.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And living too, for now his son is Duke.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WILLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Barely in title, not in revenues.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NORTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Richly in both, if justice had her right.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My heart is great, but it must break with silence,</LINE>
<LINE>Ere&#8217;t be disburdened with a liberal tongue.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NORTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, speak thy mind, and let him ne&#8217;er speak more</LINE>
<LINE>That speaks thy words again to do thee harm!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WILLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tends that thou wouldst speak to the Duke of Herford?</LINE>
<LINE>If it be so, out with it boldly, man,</LINE>
<LINE>Quick is mine ear to hear of good towards him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No good at all that I can do for him,</LINE>
<LINE>Unless you call it good to pity him,</LINE>
<LINE>Bereft and gelded of his patrimony.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NORTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, afore God, &#8217;tis shame such wrongs are borne</LINE>
<LINE>In him, a royal prince, and many more</LINE>
<LINE>Of noble blood in this declining land.</LINE>
<LINE>The King is not himself, but basely led</LINE>
<LINE>By flatterers, and what they will inform,</LINE>
<LINE>Merely in hate, &#8217;gainst any of us all,</LINE>
<LINE>That will the King severely prosecute</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Gainst us, our lives, our children, and our heirs.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The commons hath he pill&#8217;d with grievous taxes,</LINE>
<LINE>And quite lost their hearts; the nobles hath he fin&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>For ancient quarrels, and quite lost their hearts.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WILLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And daily new exactions are devis&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>As blanks, benevolences, and I wot not what.</LINE>
<LINE>But what a&#8217; God&#8217;s name doth become of this?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NORTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Wars hath not wasted it, for warr&#8217;d he hath not,</LINE>
<LINE>But basely yielded upon compromise</LINE>
<LINE>That which his noble ancestors achiev&#8217;d with blows.</LINE>
<LINE>More hath he spent in peace than they in wars.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The Earl of Wiltshire hath the realm in farm.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WILLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The King&#8217;s grown bankrout, like a broken man.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NORTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Reproach and dissolution hangeth over him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He hath not money for these Irish wars,</LINE>
<LINE>His burdenous taxations notwithstanding,</LINE>
<LINE>But by the robbing of the banish&#8217;d Duke.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NORTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>His noble kinsman&#8212;most degenerate king!</LINE>
<LINE>But, lords, we hear this fearful tempest sing,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet seek no shelter to avoid the storm;</LINE>
<LINE>We see the wind sit sore upon our sails,</LINE>
<LINE>And yet we strike not, but securely perish.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We see the very wrack that we must suffer,</LINE>
<LINE>And unavoided is the danger now,</LINE>
<LINE>For suffering so the causes of our wrack.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NORTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not so, even through the hollow eyes of death</LINE>
<LINE>I spy life peering, but I dare not say</LINE>
<LINE>How near the tidings of our comfort is.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WILLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, let us share thy thoughts, as thou dost ours.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Be confident to speak, Northumberland:</LINE>
<LINE>We three are but thyself, and, speaking so,</LINE>
<LINE>Thy words are but as thoughts, therefore be bold.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NORTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then thus: I have from Le Port Blanc,</LINE>
<LINE>A bay in Britain, receiv&#8217;d intelligence</LINE>
<LINE>That Harry Duke of Herford, Rainold Lord Cobham,</LINE>
<LINE>Thomas, son and heir to th&#8217; Earl of Arundel,</LINE>
<LINE>That late broke from the Duke of Exeter,</LINE>
<LINE>His brother, Archbishop late of Canterbury,</LINE>
<LINE>Sir Thomas Erpingham, Sir John Ramston,</LINE>
<LINE>Sir John Norbery, Sir Robert Waterton, and Francis Coint&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>All these, well furnished by the Duke of Britain</LINE>
<LINE>With eight tall ships, three thousand men of war,</LINE>
<LINE>Are making hither with all due expedience,</LINE>
<LINE>And shortly mean to touch our northern shore.</LINE>
<LINE>Perhaps they had ere this, but that they stay</LINE>
<LINE>The first departing of the King for Ireland.</LINE>
<LINE>If then we shall shake off our slavish yoke,</LINE>
<LINE>Imp out our drooping country&#8217;s broken wing,</LINE>
<LINE>Redeem from broking pawn the blemish&#8217;d crown,</LINE>
<LINE>Wipe off the dust that hides our sceptre&#8217;s gilt,</LINE>
<LINE>And make high majesty look like itself,</LINE>
<LINE>Away with me in post to Ravenspurgh;</LINE>
<LINE>But if you faint, as fearing to do so,</LINE>
<LINE>Stay, and be secret, and myself will go.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To horse, to horse! Urge doubts to them that fear.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WILLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hold out my horse, and I will first be there.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BUSHY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Madam, your Majesty is too much sad.</LINE>
<LINE>You promis&#8217;d, when you parted with the King,</LINE>
<LINE>To lay aside life-harming heaviness</LINE>
<LINE>And entertain a cheerful disposition.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To please the King I did, to please myself</LINE>
<LINE>I cannot do it; yet I know no cause</LINE>
<LINE>Why I should welcome such a guest as grief,</LINE>
<LINE>Save bidding farewell to so sweet a guest</LINE>
<LINE>As my sweet Richard. Yet again methinks</LINE>
<LINE>Some unborn sorrow, ripe in fortune&#8217;s womb,</LINE>
<LINE>Is coming towards me, and my inward soul</LINE>
<LINE>With nothing trembles; at some thing it grieves,</LINE>
<LINE>More than with parting from my lord the King.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BUSHY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Each substance of a grief hath twenty shadows,</LINE>
<LINE>Which shows like grief itself, but is not so;</LINE>
<LINE>For sorrow&#8217;s eyes, glazed with blinding tears,</LINE>
<LINE>Divides one thing entire to many objects,</LINE>
<LINE>Like perspectives, which rightly gaz&#8217;d upon</LINE>
<LINE>Show nothing but confusion; ey&#8217;d awry</LINE>
<LINE>Distinguish form; so your sweet Majesty,</LINE>
<LINE>Looking awry upon your lord&#8217;s departure,</LINE>
<LINE>Find shapes of grief, more than himself, to wail,</LINE>
<LINE>Which, look&#8217;d on as it is, is nought but shadows</LINE>
<LINE>Of what it is not; then, thrice-gracious Queen,</LINE>
<LINE>More than your lord&#8217;s departure weep not&#8212;more is not seen,</LINE>
<LINE>Or if it be, &#8217;tis with false sorrow&#8217;s eye,</LINE>
<LINE>Which for things true weeps things imaginary.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It may be so; but yet my inward soul</LINE>
<LINE>Persuades me it is otherwise. Howe&#8217;er it be,</LINE>
<LINE>I cannot but be sad; so heavy sad,</LINE>
<LINE>As, though on thinking on no thought I think,</LINE>
<LINE>Makes me with heavy nothing faint and shrink.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BUSHY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis nothing but conceit, my gracious lady.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis nothing less: conceit is still deriv&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>From some forefather grief; mine is not so,</LINE>
<LINE>For nothing hath begot my something grief,</LINE>
<LINE>Or something hath the nothing that I grieve&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis in reversion that I do possess&#8212;</LINE>

<LINE>God save your Majesty! And well met, gentlemen.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why hopest thou so? &#8217;Tis better hope he is,</LINE>

<LINE>Then wherefore dost thou hope he is not shipp&#8217;d?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That he, our hope, might have retir&#8217;d his power,</LINE>
<LINE>And driven into despair an enemy&#8217;s hope,</LINE>
<LINE>Who strongly hath set footing in this land:</LINE>
<LINE>The banish&#8217;d Bullingbrook repeals himself,</LINE>

<LINE>Ah, madam! &#8217;Tis too true, and that is worse,</LINE>
<LINE>The Lord Northumberland, his son young Harry Percy,</LINE>
<LINE>The Lords of Ross, Beaumond, and Willoughby,</LINE>
<LINE>With all their powerful friends, are fled to him.</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So, Green, thou art the midwife to my woe,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Who shall hinder me?</LINE>
<LINE>I will despair, and be at enmity</LINE>

<LINE>Here am I left to underprop his land,</LINE>
<LINE>Who, weak with age, cannot support myself.</LINE>

<LINE>The nobles they are fled, the commons they are cold,</LINE>

<LINE>God for his mercy, what a tide of woes</LINE>
<LINE>Comes rushing on this woeful land at once!</LINE>
<LINE>I know not what to do. I would to God</LINE>
<LINE>(So my untruth had not provok&#8217;d him to it)</LINE>
<LINE>The King had cut off my head with my brother&#8217;s.</LINE>
<LINE>What, are there no posts disparch&#8217;d for Ireland?</LINE>
<LINE>How shall we do for money for these wars?</LINE>
<LINE>Come, sister&#8212;cousin, I would say&#8212;pray pardon me.</LINE>
<LINE>Go, fellow, get thee home, provide some carts,</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exit Servingman.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Gentlemen, will you go muster men? If I</LINE>
<LINE>Know how or which way to order these affairs</LINE>
<LINE>Thus disorderly thrust into my hands,</LINE>
<LINE>Never believe me. Both are my kinsmen:</LINE>
<LINE>T&#8217; one is my sovereign, whom both my oath</LINE>
<LINE>And duty bids defend; t&#8217; other again</LINE>
<LINE>Is my kinsman, whom the King hath wrong&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Whom conscience and my kinred bids to right.</LINE>
<LINE>Well, somewhat we must do.</LINE>
<LINE>Come, cousin, I&#8217;ll dispose of you.</LINE>
<LINE>Gentlemen, go muster up your men,</LINE>
<LINE>And meet me presently at Berkeley.</LINE>
<LINE>I should to Plashy too,</LINE>

<LINE>The wind sits fair for news to go for Ireland,</LINE>

<LINE>Is all unpossible.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Besides, our nearness to the King in love</LINE>

<LINE>And that is the wavering commons, for their love</LINE>

<SPEAKER>BULL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How far is it, my lord, to Berkeley now?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NORTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Believe me, noble lord,</LINE>
<LINE>I am a stranger here in Gloucestershire.</LINE>
<LINE>These high wild hills and rough uneven ways</LINE>
<LINE>Draws out our miles and makes them wearisome,</LINE>
<LINE>And yet your fair discourse hath been as sugar,</LINE>
<LINE>Making the hard way sweet and delectable.</LINE>
<LINE>But I bethink me what a weary way</LINE>
<LINE>From Ravenspurgh to Cotshall will be found</LINE>
<LINE>In Ross and Willoughby, wanting your company,</LINE>
<LINE>Which, I protest, hath very much beguil&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>The tediousness and process of my travel.</LINE>
<LINE>But theirs is sweet&#8217;ned with the hope to have</LINE>
<LINE>The present benefit which I possess,</LINE>
<LINE>And hope to joy is little less in joy</LINE>
<LINE>Than hope enjoyed. By this the weary lords</LINE>
<LINE>Shall make their way seem short, as mine hath done</LINE>
<LINE>By sight of what I have, your noble company.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BULL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Of much less value is my company</LINE>
<LINE>Than your good words. But who comes here?</LINE>
</SPEECH>
<STAGEDIR>Enter Harry Percy.</STAGEDIR>


<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NORTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is my son, young Harry Percy,</LINE>
<LINE>Sent from my brother Worcester, whencesoever.</LINE>
<LINE>Harry, how fares your uncle?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PERCY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I had thought, my lord, to have learn&#8217;d his health of you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NORTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, is he not with the Queen?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PERCY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, my good lord, he hath forsook the court,</LINE>
<LINE>Broken his staff of office, and dispers&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>The household of the King.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NORTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">What was his reason?</LINE>
<LINE>He was not so resolv&#8217;d when last we spake together.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PERCY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Because your lordship was proclaimed traitor.</LINE>
<LINE>But he, my lord, is gone to Ravenspurgh</LINE>
<LINE>To offer service to the Duke of Herford,</LINE>
<LINE>And sent me over by Berkeley, to discover</LINE>
<LINE>What power the Duke of York had levied there,</LINE>
<LINE>Then with directions to repair to Ravenspurgh.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NORTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Have you forgot the Duke of Herford, boy?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PERCY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, my good lord, for that is not forgot</LINE>
<LINE>Which ne&#8217;er I did remember. To my knowledge,</LINE>
<LINE>I never in my life did look on him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NORTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then learn to know him now, this is the Duke.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PERCY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My gracious lord, I tender you my service,</LINE>
<LINE>Such as it is, being tender, raw, and young,</LINE>
<LINE>Which elder days shall ripen and confirm</LINE>
<LINE>To more approved service and desert.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BULL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I thank thee, gentle Percy, and be sure</LINE>
<LINE>I count myself in nothing else so happy</LINE>
<LINE>As in a soul rememb&#8217;ring my good friends,</LINE>
<LINE>And as my fortune ripens with thy love,</LINE>
<LINE>It shall be still thy true love&#8217;s recompense.</LINE>
<LINE>My heart this covenant makes, my hand thus seals it.</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BULL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Welcome, my lords. I wot your love pursues</LINE>
<LINE>A banish&#8217;d traitor. All my treasury</LINE>
<LINE>Is yet but unfelt thanks, which more enrich&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>Shall be your love and labor&#8217;s recompense.</LINE>

<LINE>My lord, my answer is to Lancaster,</LINE>
<LINE>And I am come to seek that name in England,</LINE>
<LINE>And I must find that title in your tongue,</LINE>
<LINE>Before I make reply to aught you say.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BERK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Mistake me not, my lord, &#8217;tis not my meaning</LINE>
<LINE>To rase one title of your honor out.</LINE>
<LINE>To you, my lord, I come, what lord you will,</LINE>
<LINE>From the most gracious regent of this land,</LINE>
<LINE>The Duke of York, to know what pricks you on</LINE>
<LINE>To take advantage of the absent time,</LINE>
<LINE>And fright our native peace with self-borne arms.</LINE>
</SPEECH>
<STAGEDIR>Enter York attended.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEAKER>BULL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My gracious uncle&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tut, tut!</LINE>
<LINE>Grace me no grace, nor uncle me no uncle.</LINE>
<LINE>I am no traitor&#8217;s uncle, and that word &#8220;grace&#8221;</LINE>
<LINE>In an ungracious mouth is but profane.</LINE>
<LINE>Why have those banish&#8217;d and forbidden legs</LINE>
<LINE>Dar&#8217;d once to touch a dust of England&#8217;s ground?</LINE>
<LINE>But then more &#8220;why?&#8221;&#8212;why have they dar&#8217;d to march</LINE>
<LINE>So many miles upon her peaceful bosom,</LINE>
<LINE>Frighting her pale-fac&#8217;d villages with war</LINE>
<LINE>And ostentation of despised arms?</LINE>
<LINE>Com&#8217;st thou because the anointed King is hence?</LINE>
<LINE>Why, foolish boy, the King is left behind,</LINE>
<LINE>And in my loyal bosom lies his power.</LINE>
<LINE>Were I but now lord of such hot youth</LINE>
<LINE>As when brave Gaunt, thy father, and myself</LINE>
<LINE>Rescued the Black Prince, that young Mars of men,</LINE>
<LINE>From forth the ranks of many thousand French,</LINE>
<LINE>O then how quickly should this arm of mine,</LINE>
<LINE>Now prisoner to the palsy, chastise thee,</LINE>
<LINE>And minister correction to thy fault!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BULL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My gracious uncle, let me know my fault,</LINE>
<LINE>On what condition stands it and wherein?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Even in condition of the worst degree,</LINE>
<LINE>In gross rebellion and detested treason.</LINE>
<LINE>Thou art a banish&#8217;d man, and here art come,</LINE>
<LINE>Before the expiration of thy time,</LINE>
<LINE>In braving arms against thy sovereign.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BULL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As I was banish&#8217;d, I was banish&#8217;d Herford,</LINE>
<LINE>But as I come, I come for Lancaster.</LINE>
<LINE>And, noble uncle, I beseech your Grace</LINE>
<LINE>Look on my wrongs with an indifferent eye.</LINE>
<LINE>You are my father, for methinks in you</LINE>
<LINE>I see old Gaunt alive. O then, my father,</LINE>
<LINE>Will you permit that I shall stand condemn&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>A wandering vagabond, my rights and royalties</LINE>
<LINE>Pluck&#8217;d from my arms perforce&#8212;and given away</LINE>
<LINE>To upstart unthrifts? Wherefore was I born?</LINE>
<LINE>If that my cousin king be King in England,</LINE>
<LINE>It must be granted I am Duke of Lancaster.</LINE>
<LINE>You have a son, Aumerle, my noble cousin,</LINE>
<LINE>Had you first died, and he been thus trod down,</LINE>
<LINE>He should have found his uncle Gaunt a father</LINE>
<LINE>To rouse his wrongs and chase them to the bay.</LINE>
<LINE>I am denied to sue my livery here,</LINE>
<LINE>And yet my letters-patents give me leave.</LINE>
<LINE>My father&#8217;s goods are all distrain&#8217;d and sold,</LINE>
<LINE>And these, and all, are all amiss employed.</LINE>
<LINE>What would you have me do? I am a subject,</LINE>
<LINE>And I challenge law. Attorneys are denied me,</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore personally I lay my claim</LINE>
<LINE>To my inheritance of free descent.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NORTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The noble Duke hath been too much abused.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROSS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It stands your Grace upon to do him right.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WILLO.</SPEAKER>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lords of England, let me tell you this:</LINE>
<LINE>I have had feeling of my cousin&#8217;s wrongs,</LINE>
<LINE>And labor&#8217;d all I could to do him right;</LINE>
<LINE>But in this kind to come, in braving arms,</LINE>
<LINE>Be his own carver and cut out his way,</LINE>
<LINE>To find out right with wrong&#8212;it may not be;</LINE>
<LINE>And you that do abet him in this kind</LINE>
<LINE>Cherish rebellion and are rebels all.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NORTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The noble Duke hath sworn his coming is</LINE>
<LINE>But for his own; and for the right of that</LINE>
<LINE>We all have strongly sworn to give him aid;</LINE>
<LINE>And let him never see joy that breaks that oath!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, well, I see the issue of these arms.</LINE>
<LINE>I cannot mend it, I must needs confess,</LINE>
<LINE>Because my power is weak and all ill left;</LINE>
<LINE>But if I could, by Him that gave me life,</LINE>
<LINE>I would attach you all, and make you stoop</LINE>
<LINE>Unto the sovereign mercy of the King;</LINE>
<LINE>But since I cannot, be it known unto you</LINE>
<LINE>I do remain as neuter. So fare you well,</LINE>
<LINE>Unless you please to enter in the castle,</LINE>
<LINE>And there repose you for this night.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BULL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>An offer, uncle, that we will accept,</LINE>
<LINE>But we must win your Grace to go with us</LINE>
<LINE>To Bristow castle, which they say is held</LINE>

<LINE>It may be I will go with you, but yet I&#8217;ll pause,</LINE>

<LINE>Thy sun sets weeping in the lowly west,</LINE>

<SPEAKER>BULL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Bring forth these men.</LINE>
<LINE>Bushy and Green, I will not vex your souls&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Since presently your souls must part your bodies&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>With too much urging your pernicious lives,</LINE>
<LINE>For &#8217;twere no charity; yet, to wash your blood</LINE>
<LINE>From off my hands, here in the view of men</LINE>
<LINE>I will unfold some causes of your deaths:</LINE>
<LINE>You have misled a prince, a royal king,</LINE>
<LINE>A happy gentleman in blood and lineaments,</LINE>
<LINE>By you unhappied and disfigured clean;</LINE>
<LINE>You have in manner with your sinful hours</LINE>
<LINE>Made a divorce betwixt his queen and him,</LINE>
<LINE>Broke the possession of a royal bed,</LINE>
<LINE>And stain&#8217;d the beauty of a fair queen&#8217;s cheeks</LINE>
<LINE>With tears drawn from her eyes by your foul wrongs;</LINE>
<LINE>Myself, a prince by fortune of my birth,</LINE>
<LINE>Near to the King in blood, and near in love</LINE>
<LINE>Till you did make him misinterpret me,</LINE>
<LINE>Have stoop&#8217;d my neck under your injuries,</LINE>
<LINE>And sigh&#8217;d my English breath in foreign clouds,</LINE>
<LINE>Eating the bitter bread of banishment,</LINE>
<LINE>Whilst you have fed upon my signories,</LINE>
<LINE>Dispark&#8217;d my parks and fell&#8217;d my forest woods,</LINE>
<LINE>From my own windows torn my household coat,</LINE>
<LINE>Ras&#8217;d out my imprese, leaving me no sign,</LINE>
<LINE>Save men&#8217;s opinions and my living blood,</LINE>
<LINE>To show the world I am a gentleman.</LINE>
<LINE>This and much more, much more than twice all this,</LINE>
<LINE>Condemns you to the death. See them delivered over</LINE>
<LINE>To execution and the hand of death.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>K. RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Barkloughly castle call they this at hand?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yea, my lord. How brooks your Grace the air</LINE>
<LINE>After your late tossing on the breaking seas?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Needs must I like it well; I weep for joy</LINE>
<LINE>To stand upon my kingdom once again.</LINE>
<LINE>Dear earth, I do salute thee with my hand,</LINE>
<LINE>Though rebels wound thee with their horses&#8217; hoofs.</LINE>
<LINE>As a long-parted mother with her child</LINE>
<LINE>Plays fondly with her tears and smiles in meeting,</LINE>
<LINE>So weeping, smiling, greet I thee, my earth,</LINE>
<LINE>And do thee favors with my royal hands.</LINE>
<LINE>Feed not thy sovereign&#8217;s foe, my gentle earth,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor with thy sweets comfort his ravenous sense,</LINE>
<LINE>But let thy spiders, that suck up thy venom,</LINE>
<LINE>And heavy-gaited toads lie in their way,</LINE>
<LINE>Doing annoyance to the treacherous feet,</LINE>
<LINE>Which with usurping steps do trample thee.</LINE>
<LINE>Yield stinging nettles to mine enemies;</LINE>
<LINE>And when they from thy bosom pluck a flower,</LINE>
<LINE>Guard it, I pray thee, with a lurking adder,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose double tongue may with a mortal touch</LINE>
<LINE>Throw death upon thy sovereign&#8217;s enemies.</LINE>
<LINE>Mock not my senseless conjuration, lords,</LINE>
<LINE>This earth shall have a feeling, and these stones</LINE>
<LINE>Prove armed soldiers, ere her native king</LINE>
<LINE>Shall falter under foul rebellion&#8217;s arms.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fear not, my lord, that Power that made you king</LINE>
<LINE>Hath power to keep you king in spite of all.</LINE>
<LINE>The means that heavens yield must be embrac&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>And not neglected; else heaven would,</LINE>
<LINE>And we will not. Heaven&#8217;s offer we refuse,</LINE>
<LINE>The proffered means of succors and redress.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He means, my lord, that we are too remiss,</LINE>
<LINE>Whilst Bullingbrook, through our security,</LINE>
<LINE>Grows strong and great in substance and in power.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Discomfortable cousin, know&#8217;st thou not</LINE>
<LINE>That when the searching eye of heaven is hid</LINE>
<LINE>Behind the globe, that lights the lower world,</LINE>
<LINE>Then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen</LINE>
<LINE>In murders and in outrage boldly here,</LINE>
<LINE>But when from under this terrestrial ball</LINE>
<LINE>He fires the proud tops of the eastern pines</LINE>
<LINE>And darts his light through every guilty hole,</LINE>
<LINE>Then murders, treasons, and detested sins,</LINE>
<LINE>The cloak of night being pluck&#8217;d from off their backs,</LINE>
<LINE>Stand bare and naked, trembling at themselves?</LINE>
<LINE>So when this thief, this traitor Bullingbrook,</LINE>
<LINE>Who all this while hath revell&#8217;d in the night,</LINE>
<LINE>Whilst we were wand&#8217;ring with the antipodes,</LINE>
<LINE>Shall see us rising in our throne, the east,</LINE>
<LINE>His treasons will sit blushing in his face,</LINE>
<LINE>Not able to endure the sight of day,</LINE>
<LINE>But self-affrighted tremble at his sin.</LINE>
<LINE>Not all the water in the rough rude sea</LINE>
<LINE>Can wash the balm off from an anointed king;</LINE>
<LINE>The breath of worldly men cannot depose</LINE>
<LINE>The deputy elected by the Lord;</LINE>
<LINE>For every man that Bullingbrook hath press&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>To lift shrewd steel against our golden crown,</LINE>
<LINE>God for his Richard hath in heavenly pay</LINE>
<LINE>A glorious angel; then if angels fight,</LINE>
<LINE>Weak men must fall, for heaven still guards the right.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Salisbury.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Welcome, my lord. How far off lies your power?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nor near nor farther off, my gracious lord,</LINE>
<LINE>Than this weak arm. Discomfort guides my tongue</LINE>
<LINE>And bids me speak of nothing but despair.</LINE>
<LINE>One day too late, I fear me, noble lord,</LINE>
<LINE>Hath clouded all thy happy days on earth.</LINE>
<LINE>O, call back yesterday, bid time return,</LINE>
<LINE>And thou shalt have twelve thousand fighting men!</LINE>
<LINE>Today, today, unhappy day, too late,</LINE>
<LINE>Overthrows thy joys, friends, fortune, and thy state,</LINE>
<LINE>For all the Welshmen, hearing thou wert dead,</LINE>
<LINE>Are gone to Bullingbrook, dispers&#8217;d and fled.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Comfort, my liege, why looks your Grace so pale?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But now the blood of twenty thousand men</LINE>
<LINE>Did triumph in my face, and they are fled;</LINE>
<LINE>And till so much blood thither come again,</LINE>
<LINE>Have I not reason to look pale and dead?</LINE>
<LINE>All souls that will be safe, fly from my side,</LINE>
<LINE>For time hath set a blot upon my pride.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Comfort, my liege, remember who you are.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I had forgot myself, am I not king?</LINE>
<LINE>Awake, thou coward majesty! Thou sleepest.</LINE>
<LINE>Is not the king&#8217;s name twenty thousand names?</LINE>
<LINE>Arm, arm, my name! A puny subject strikes</LINE>
<LINE>At thy great glory. Look not to the ground,</LINE>
<LINE>Ye favorites of a king, are we not high?</LINE>
<LINE>High be our thoughts. I know my uncle York</LINE>
<LINE>Hath power enough to serve our turn. But who comes here?</LINE>
</SPEECH>
<STAGEDIR>Enter Scroop.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SCROOP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>More health and happiness betide my liege</LINE>
<LINE>Than can my care-tun&#8217;d tongue deliver him!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Mine ear is open, and my heart prepar&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>The worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold.</LINE>
<LINE>Say, is my kingdom lost? Why, &#8217;twas my care,</LINE>
<LINE>And what loss is it to be rid of care?</LINE>
<LINE>Strives Bullingbrook to be as great as we?</LINE>
<LINE>Greater he shall not be; if he serve God,</LINE>
<LINE>We&#8217;ll serve Him too, and be his fellow so.</LINE>
<LINE>Revolt our subjects? That we cannot mend,</LINE>
<LINE>They break their faith to God as well as us.</LINE>
<LINE>Cry woe, destruction, ruin, and decay:</LINE>
<LINE>The worst is death, and death will have his day.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SCROOP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Glad am I that your Highness is so arm&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>To bear the tidings of calamity.</LINE>
<LINE>Like an unseasonable stormy day,</LINE>
<LINE>Which makes the silver rivers drown their shores,</LINE>
<LINE>As if the world were all dissolv&#8217;d to tears,</LINE>
<LINE>So high above his limits swells the rage</LINE>
<LINE>Of Bullingbrook, covering your fearful land</LINE>
<LINE>With hard bright steel, and hearts harder than steel.</LINE>
<LINE>White-beards have arm&#8217;d their thin and hairless scalps</LINE>
<LINE>Against thy majesty; boys, with women&#8217;s voices,</LINE>
<LINE>Strive to speak big, and clap their female joints</LINE>
<LINE>In stiff unwieldy arms against thy crown;</LINE>
<LINE>Thy very beadsmen learn to bend their bows</LINE>
<LINE>Of double-fatal yew against thy state;</LINE>
<LINE>Yea, distaff-women manage rusty bills</LINE>
<LINE>Against thy seat: both young and old rebel,</LINE>
<LINE>And all goes worse than I have power to tell.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Too well, too well thou tell&#8217;st a tale so ill.</LINE>
<LINE>Where is the Earl of Wiltshire? Where is Bagot?</LINE>
<LINE>What is become of Bushy? Where is Green?</LINE>
<LINE>That they have let the dangerous enemy</LINE>
<LINE>Measure our confines with such peaceful steps?</LINE>
<LINE>If we prevail, their heads shall pay for it.</LINE>
<LINE>I warrant they have made peace with Bullingbrook.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SCROOP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Peace have they made with him indeed, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O villains, vipers, damn&#8217;d without redemption!</LINE>
<LINE>Dogs, easily won to fawn on any man!</LINE>
<LINE>Snakes, in my heart-blood warm&#8217;d, that sting my heart!</LINE>
<LINE>Three Judases, each one thrice worse than Judas!</LINE>
<LINE>Would they make peace? Terrible hell</LINE>
<LINE>Make war upon their spotted souls for this!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SCROOP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sweet love, I see, changing his property,</LINE>
<LINE>Turns to the sourest and most deadly hate.</LINE>
<LINE>Again uncurse their souls, their peace is made</LINE>
<LINE>With heads, and not with hands. Those whom you curse</LINE>
<LINE>Have felt the worst of death&#8217;s destroying wound,</LINE>
<LINE>And lie full low, grav&#8217;d in the hollow ground.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is Bushy, Green, and the Earl of Wiltshire dead?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SCROOP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, all of them at Bristow lost their heads.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Where is the Duke my father with his power?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No matter where&#8212;of comfort no man speak:</LINE>
<LINE>Let&#8217;s talk of graves, of worms, and epitaphs,</LINE>
<LINE>Make dust our paper, and with rainy eyes</LINE>
<LINE>Write sorrow on the bosom of the earth.</LINE>
<LINE>Let&#8217;s choose executors and talk of wills;</LINE>
<LINE>And yet not so, for what can we bequeath</LINE>
<LINE>Save our deposed bodies to the ground?</LINE>
<LINE>Our lands, our lives, and all are Bullingbrook&#8217;s,</LINE>
<LINE>And nothing can we call our own but death,</LINE>
<LINE>And that small model of the barren earth</LINE>
<LINE>Which serves as paste and cover to our bones.</LINE>
<LINE>For God&#8217;s sake let us sit upon the ground</LINE>
<LINE>And tell sad stories of the death of kings:</LINE>
<LINE>How some have been depos&#8217;d, some slain in war,</LINE>
<LINE>Some haunted by the ghosts they have deposed,</LINE>
<LINE>Some poisoned by their wives, some sleeping kill&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>All murdered&#8212;for within the hollow crown</LINE>
<LINE>That rounds the mortal temples of a king</LINE>
<LINE>Keeps Death his court, and there the antic sits,</LINE>
<LINE>Scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp,</LINE>
<LINE>Allowing him a breath, a little scene,</LINE>
<LINE>To monarchize, be fear&#8217;d, and kill with looks,</LINE>
<LINE>Infusing him with self and vain conceit,</LINE>
<LINE>As if this flesh which walls about our life</LINE>
<LINE>Were brass impregnable; and humor&#8217;d thus,</LINE>
<LINE>Comes at the last and with a little pin</LINE>
<LINE>Bores thorough his castle wall, and farewell king!</LINE>
<LINE>Cover your heads, and mock not flesh and blood</LINE>
<LINE>With solemn reverence, throw away respect,</LINE>
<LINE>Tradition, form, and ceremonious duty,</LINE>
<LINE>For you have but mistook me all this while.</LINE>
<LINE>I live with bread like you, feel want,</LINE>
<LINE>Taste grief, need friends: subjected thus,</LINE>
<LINE>How can you say to me I am a king?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, wise men ne&#8217;er sit and wail their woes,</LINE>
<LINE>But presently prevent the ways to wail;</LINE>
<LINE>To fear the foe, since fear oppresseth strength,</LINE>
<LINE>Gives in your weakness strength unto your foe,</LINE>
<LINE>And so your follies fight against yourself.</LINE>
<LINE>Fear, and be slain&#8212;no worse can come to fight,</LINE>
<LINE>And fight and die is death destroying death,</LINE>
<LINE>Where fearing dying pays death servile breath.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My father hath a power, inquire of him,</LINE>
<LINE>And learn to make a body of a limb.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou chid&#8217;st me well. Proud Bullingbrook, I come</LINE>
<LINE>To change blows with thee for our day of doom.</LINE>
<LINE>This ague fit of fear is overblown,</LINE>
<LINE>An easy task it is to win our own.</LINE>
<LINE>Say, Scroop, where lies our uncle with his power?</LINE>
<LINE>Speak sweetly, man, although thy looks be sour.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SCROOP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Men judge by the complexion of the sky</LINE>
<LINE>The state and inclination of the day;</LINE>
<LINE>So may you by my dull and heavy eye:</LINE>
<LINE>My tongue hath but a heavier tale to say.</LINE>
<LINE>I play the torturer by small and small</LINE>
<LINE>To lengthen out the worst that must be spoken:</LINE>
<LINE>Your uncle York is join&#8217;d with Bullingbrook,</LINE>
<LINE>And all your northern castles yielded up,</LINE>
<LINE>And all your southern gentlemen in arms</LINE>
<LINE>Upon his party.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEAKER>K. RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="3">Thou hast said enough.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>To Aumerle.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Beshrew thee, cousin, which didst lead me forth</LINE>
<LINE>Of that sweet way I was in to despair!</LINE>
<LINE>What say you now? What comfort have we now?</LINE>
<LINE>By heaven, I&#8217;ll hate him everlastingly</LINE>
<LINE>That bids me be of comfort any more.</LINE>
<LINE>Go to Flint castle, there I&#8217;ll pine away&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>A king, woe&#8217;s slave, shall kingly woe obey.</LINE>
<LINE>That power I have, discharge, and let them go</LINE>
<LINE>To ear the land that hath some hope to grow,</LINE>
<LINE>For I have none. Let no man speak again</LINE>
<LINE>To alter this, for counsel is but vain.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BULL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So that by this intelligence we learn</LINE>

<LINE>The news is very fair and good, my lord:</LINE>
<LINE>Richard not far from hence hath hid his head.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It would beseem the Lord Northumberland</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Your Grace mistakes; only to be brief</LINE>

<SPEAKER>YORK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">The time hath been,</LINE>
<LINE>Would you have been so brief with him, he would</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BULL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Mistake not, uncle, further than you should.</LINE>

<LINE>I know it, uncle, and oppose not myself</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BULL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Royally?</LINE>
<LINE>Why, it contains no king.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PERCY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Yes, my good lord,</LINE>
<LINE>It doth contain a king. King Richard lies</LINE>
<LINE>Within the limits of yon lime and stone,</LINE>
<LINE>And with him are the Lord Aumerle, Lord Salisbury,</LINE>
<LINE>Sir Stephen Scroop, besides a clergyman</LINE>
<LINE>Of holy reverence, who, I cannot learn.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NORTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, belike it is the Bishop of Carlisle.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BULL.</SPEAKER>
<STAGEDIR>To Northumberland.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Noble lord,</LINE>
<LINE>Go to the rude ribs of that ancient castle;</LINE>
<LINE>Through brazen trumpet send the breath of parley</LINE>
<LINE>Into his ruin&#8217;d ears, and thus deliver:</LINE>
<LINE>Henry Bullingbrook</LINE>
<LINE>On both his knees doth kiss King Richard&#8217;s hand,</LINE>
<LINE>And sends allegiance and true faith of heart</LINE>
<LINE>To his most royal person; hither come</LINE>
<LINE>Even at his feet to lay my arms and power,</LINE>
<LINE>Provided that my banishment repeal&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>And lands restor&#8217;d again be freely granted.</LINE>
<LINE>If not, I&#8217;ll use the advantage of my power,</LINE>
<LINE>And lay the summer&#8217;s dust with show&#8217;rs of blood</LINE>
<LINE>Rain&#8217;d from the wounds of slaughtered Englishmen,</LINE>
<LINE>The which, how far off from the mind of Bullingbrook</LINE>
<LINE>It is, such crimson tempest should bedrench</LINE>
<LINE>The fresh green lap of fair King Richard&#8217;s land,</LINE>
<LINE>My stooping duty tenderly shall show.</LINE>
<LINE>Go signify as much, while here we march</LINE>
<LINE>Upon the grassy carpet of this plain.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Northumberland advances to the castle, with a Trumpet.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Let&#8217;s march without the noise of threat&#8217;ning drum,</LINE>
<LINE>That from this castle&#8217;s tottered battlements</LINE>
<LINE>Our fair appointments may be well perus&#8217;d.</LINE>
<LINE>Methinks King Richard and myself should meet</LINE>
<LINE>With no less terror than the elements</LINE>
<LINE>Of fire and water, when their thund&#8217;ring shock</LINE>
<LINE>At meeting tears the cloudy cheeks of heaven.</LINE>
<LINE>Be he the fire, I&#8217;ll be the yielding water;</LINE>
<LINE>The rage be his, whilst on the earth I rain</LINE>
<LINE>My waters&#8212;on the earth, and not on him.</LINE>
<LINE>March on, and mark King Richard how he looks.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>The trumpets sound parle without and answer within; then a flourish. Richard appeareth on the walls with Carlisle, Aumerle, Scroop, Salisbury.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>See, see, King Richard doth himself appear,</LINE>

<LINE>Yet looks he like a king! Behold, his eye,</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>To Northumberland.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>We are amaz&#8217;d, and thus long have we stood</LINE>
<LINE>To watch the fearful bending of thy knee,</LINE>
<LINE>Because we thought ourself thy lawful king;</LINE>
<LINE>And if we be, how dare thy joints forget</LINE>
<LINE>To pay their aweful duty to our presence?</LINE>
<LINE>If we be not, show us the hand of God</LINE>
<LINE>That hath dismiss&#8217;d us from our stewardship,</LINE>
<LINE>For well we know no hand of blood and bone</LINE>
<LINE>Can gripe the sacred handle of our sceptre,</LINE>
<LINE>Unless he do profane, steal, or usurp.</LINE>
<LINE>And though you think that all, as you have done,</LINE>
<LINE>Have torn their souls by turning them from us,</LINE>
<LINE>And we are barren and bereft of friends,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet know, my master, God omnipotent,</LINE>
<LINE>Is mustering in his clouds on our behalf</LINE>
<LINE>Armies of pestilence, and they shall strike</LINE>
<LINE>Your children yet unborn and unbegot,</LINE>
<LINE>That lift your vassal hands against my head,</LINE>
<LINE>And threat the glory of my precious crown.</LINE>
<LINE>Tell Bullingbrook&#8212;for yon methinks he stands&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>That every stride he makes upon my land</LINE>
<LINE>Is dangerous treason. He is come to open</LINE>
<LINE>The purple testament of bleeding war;</LINE>
<LINE>But ere the crown he looks for live in peace,</LINE>
<LINE>Ten thousand bloody crowns of mothers&#8217; sons</LINE>
<LINE>Shall ill become the flower of England&#8217;s face,</LINE>
<LINE>Change the complexion of her maid-pale peace</LINE>
<LINE>To scarlet indignation, and bedew</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NORTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The King of heaven forbid our lord the King</LINE>
<LINE>Should so with civil and uncivil arms</LINE>
<LINE>Be rush&#8217;d upon! Thy thrice-noble cousin,</LINE>
<LINE>Harry Bullingbrook, doth humbly kiss thy hand,</LINE>
<LINE>And by the honorable tomb he swears</LINE>
<LINE>That stands upon your royal grandsire&#8217;s bones,</LINE>
<LINE>And by the royalties of both your bloods,</LINE>
<LINE>Currents that spring from one most gracious head,</LINE>
<LINE>And by the buried hand of warlike Gaunt,</LINE>
<LINE>And by the worth and honor of himself,</LINE>
<LINE>Comprising all that may be sworn or said,</LINE>
<LINE>His coming hither hath no further scope</LINE>
<LINE>Than for his lineal royalties, and to beg</LINE>
<LINE>Enfranchisement immediate on his knees,</LINE>
<LINE>Which on thy royal party granted once,</LINE>
<LINE>His glittering arms he will commend to rust,</LINE>
<LINE>His barbed steeds to stables, and his heart</LINE>
<LINE>To faithful service of your Majesty.</LINE>
<LINE>This swears he, as he is a prince, is just,</LINE>
<LINE>And as I am a gentleman I credit him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Northumberland withdraws to Bullingbrook.</STAGEDIR>


<STAGEDIR>To Aumerle.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>We do debase ourselves, cousin, do we not,</LINE>
<LINE>To look so poorly and to speak so fair?</LINE>
<LINE>Shall we call back Northumberland, and send</LINE>
<LINE>Defiance to the traitor, and so die?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>On yon proud man should take it off again</LINE>
<LINE>With words of sooth! O that I were as great</LINE>
<LINE>As is my grief, or lesser than my name!</LINE>
<LINE>Or that I could forget what I have been!</LINE>
<LINE>Or not remember what I must be now!</LINE>
<LINE>Swell&#8217;st thou, proud heart? I&#8217;ll give thee scope to beat,</LINE>

<LINE>The King shall be contented. Must he lose</LINE>
<LINE>The name of king? A&#8217; God&#8217;s name let it go.</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll give my jewels for a set of beads,</LINE>
<LINE>My gorgeous palace for a hermitage,</LINE>
<LINE>My gay apparel for an almsman&#8217;s gown,</LINE>
<LINE>My figur&#8217;d goblets for a dish of wood,</LINE>
<LINE>My sceptre for a palmer&#8217;s walking-staff,</LINE>
<LINE>My subjects for a pair of carved saints,</LINE>
<LINE>And my large kingdom for a little grave,</LINE>
<LINE>A little little grave, an obscure grave&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Or I&#8217;ll be buried in the king&#8217;s high way,</LINE>
<LINE>Some way of common trade, where subjects&#8217; feet</LINE>
<LINE>May hourly trample on their sovereign&#8217;s head;</LINE>
<LINE>For on my heart they tread now whilst I live,</LINE>
<LINE>And buried once, why not upon my head?</LINE>
<LINE>Aumerle, thou weep&#8217;st, my tender-hearted cousin!</LINE>
<LINE>We&#8217;ll make foul weather with despised tears;</LINE>
<LINE>Our sighs and they shall lodge the summer corn,</LINE>
<LINE>And make a dearth in this revolting land.</LINE>
<LINE>Or shall we play the wantons with our woes</LINE>
<LINE>And make some pretty match with shedding tears?</LINE>
<LINE>As thus to drop them still upon one place,</LINE>
<LINE>Till they have fretted us a pair of graves</LINE>
<LINE>Within the earth, and, therein laid&#8212;there lies</LINE>
<LINE>Two kinsmen digg&#8217;d their graves with weeping eyes.</LINE>
<LINE>Would not this ill do well? Well, well, I see</LINE>
<LINE>I talk but idlely, and you laugh at me.</LINE>
<LINE>Most mighty prince, my Lord Northumberland,</LINE>
<LINE>What says King Bullingbrook? Will his Majesty</LINE>
<LINE>Give Richard leave to live till Richard die?</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What sport shall we devise here in this garden</LINE>
<LINE>To drive away the heavy thought of care?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. LADY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Madam, we&#8217;ll play at bowls.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;Twill make me think the world is full of rubs,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. LADY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Madam, we&#8217;ll dance.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My legs can keep no measure in delight,</LINE>

<LINE>Therefore no dancing, girl, some other sport.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. LADY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Madam, we&#8217;ll tell tales.</LINE>

<LINE offset="4">Of either, madam.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Of neither, girl;</LINE>
<LINE>For if of joy, being altogether wanting,</LINE>
<LINE>It doth remember me the more of sorrow;</LINE>
<LINE>Or if of grief, being altogether had,</LINE>
<LINE>It adds more sorrow to my want of joy;</LINE>
<LINE>For what I have I need not to repeat,</LINE>

<LINE>Let&#8217;s step into the shadow of these trees.</LINE>

<LINE>Give some supportance to the bending twigs.</LINE>
<LINE>Go thou, and like an executioner</LINE>
<LINE>Cut off the heads of too fast growing sprays,</LINE>
<LINE>That look too lofty in our commonwealth:</LINE>
<LINE>All must be even in our government.</LINE>
<LINE>You thus employed, I will go root away</LINE>

<LINE>Why should we in the compass of a pale</LINE>

<LINE>When our sea-walled garden, the whole land,</LINE>
<LINE>Is full of weeds, her fairest flowers chok&#8217;d up,</LINE>
<LINE>Her fruit-trees all unprun&#8217;d, her hedges ruin&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Her knots disordered, and her wholesome herbs</LINE>
<LINE>Swarming with caterpillars?</LINE>

<SPEAKER>GARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">Hold thy peace.</LINE>
<LINE>He that hath suffered this disordered spring</LINE>
<LINE>Hath now himself met with the fall of leaf.</LINE>
<LINE>The weeds which his broad-spreading leaves did shelter,</LINE>
<LINE>That seem&#8217;d in eating him to hold him up,</LINE>
<LINE>Are pluck&#8217;d up root and all by Bullingbrook,</LINE>
<LINE>I mean the Earl of Wiltshire, Bushy, Green.</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">They are; and Bullingbrook</LINE>
<LINE>Hath seiz&#8217;d the wasteful King. O, what pity is it</LINE>
<LINE>That he had not so trimm&#8217;d and dress&#8217;d his land</LINE>
<LINE>As we this garden! We at time of year</LINE>
<LINE>Do wound the bark, the skin of our fruit-trees,</LINE>
<LINE>Lest being over-proud in sap and blood,</LINE>
<LINE>With too much riches it confound itself;</LINE>
<LINE>Had he done so to great and growing men,</LINE>
<LINE>They might have liv&#8217;d to bear and he to taste</LINE>
<LINE>Their fruits of duty. Superfluous branches</LINE>
<LINE>We lop away, that bearing boughs may live;</LINE>
<LINE>Had he done so, himself had borne the crown,</LINE>
<LINE>Which waste of idle hours hath quite thrown down.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. MAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, think you the King shall be deposed?</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Depress&#8217;d he is already, and depos&#8217;d</LINE>

<LINE>O, I am press&#8217;d to death through want of speaking!</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Coming forward.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Thou old Adam&#8217;s likeness, set to dress this garden,</LINE>
<LINE>How dares thy harsh rude tongue sound this unpleassing news?</LINE>
<LINE>What Eve, what serpent, hath suggested thee</LINE>
<LINE>To make a second fall of cursed man?</LINE>
<LINE>Why dost thou say King Richard is depos&#8217;d?</LINE>
<LINE>Dar&#8217;st thou, thou little better thing than earth,</LINE>
<LINE>Divine his downfall? Say, where, when, and how,</LINE>
<LINE>Cam&#8217;st thou by this ill tidings? Speak, thou wretch.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pardon me, madam, little joy have I</LINE>
<LINE>To breathe this news, yet what I say is true:</LINE>
<LINE>King Richard, he is in the mighty hold</LINE>
<LINE>Of Bullingbrook; their fortunes both are weigh&#8217;d.</LINE>
<LINE>In your lord&#8217;s scale is nothing but himself,</LINE>
<LINE>And some few vanities that make him light;</LINE>
<LINE>But in the balance of great Bullingbrook,</LINE>
<LINE>Besides himself, are all the English peers,</LINE>
<LINE>And with that odds he weighs King Richard down.</LINE>
<LINE>Post you to London and you will find it so,</LINE>
<LINE>I speak no more than every one doth know.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nimble mischance, that art so light of foot,</LINE>
<LINE>Doth not thy embassage belong to me,</LINE>
<LINE>And am I last that knows it? O, thou thinkest</LINE>
<LINE>To serve me last that I may longest keep</LINE>
<LINE>Thy sorrow in my breast. Come, ladies, go</LINE>
<LINE>To meet at London London&#8217;s king in woe.</LINE>
<LINE>What, was I born to this, that my sad look</LINE>
<LINE>Should grace the triumph of great Bullingbrook?</LINE>
<LINE>Gard&#8217;ner, for telling me these news of woe,</LINE>
<LINE>Pray God the plants thou graft&#8217;st may never grow.</LINE>

<LINE>Poor queen, so that thy state might be no worse,</LINE>
<LINE>I would my skill were subject to thy curse.</LINE>

<LINE>As I intend to thrive in this new world,</LINE>
<LINE>Aumerle is guilty of my true appeal;</LINE>

<LINE>Great Duke of Lancaster, I come to thee</LINE>

<LINE>To the possession of thy royal hand.</LINE>
<LINE>Ascend his throne, descending now from him,</LINE>

<SPEAKER>CAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, God forbid!</LINE>
<LINE>Worst in this royal presence may I speak,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet best beseeming me to speak the truth.</LINE>
<LINE>Would God that any in this noble presence</LINE>
<LINE>Were enough noble to be upright judge</LINE>
<LINE>Of noble Richard! Then true noblesse would</LINE>
<LINE>Learn him forbearance from so foul a wrong.</LINE>
<LINE>What subject can give sentence on his king?</LINE>
<LINE>And who sits here that is not Richard&#8217;s subject?</LINE>
<LINE>Thieves are not judg&#8217;d but they are by to hear,</LINE>
<LINE>Although apparent guilt be seen in them,</LINE>
<LINE>And shall the figure of God&#8217;s majesty,</LINE>
<LINE>His captain, steward, deputy, elect,</LINE>
<LINE>Anointed, crowned, planted many years,</LINE>
<LINE>Be judg&#8217;d by subject and inferior breath,</LINE>
<LINE>And he himself not present? O, forfend it, God,</LINE>
<LINE>That in a Christian climate souls refin&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>Should show so heinous, black, obscene a deed!</LINE>
<LINE>I speak to subjects, and a subject speaks,</LINE>
<LINE>Stirr&#8217;d up by God, thus boldly for his king.</LINE>
<LINE>My Lord of Herford here, whom you call king,</LINE>
<LINE>Is a foul traitor to proud Herford&#8217;s king,</LINE>
<LINE>And if you crown him, let me prophesy,</LINE>
<LINE>The blood of English shall manure the ground,</LINE>
<LINE>And future ages groan for this foul act.</LINE>
<LINE>Peace shall go sleep with Turks and infidels,</LINE>
<LINE>And in this seat of peace tumultuous wars</LINE>

<SPEAKER>K. RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alack, why am I sent for to a king</LINE>
<LINE>Before I have shook off the regal thoughts</LINE>
<LINE>Wherewith I reign&#8217;d? I hardly yet have learn&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>To insinuate, flatter, bow, and bend my knee.</LINE>
<LINE>Give sorrow leave a while to tutor me</LINE>
<LINE>To this submission. Yet I well remember</LINE>
<LINE>The favors of these men. Were they not mine?</LINE>
<LINE>Did they not sometimes cry &#8220;All hail!&#8221; to me?</LINE>
<LINE>So Judas did to Christ; but He, in twelve,</LINE>
<LINE>Found truth in all but one; I, in twelve thousand, none.</LINE>
<LINE>God save the King! Will no man say amen?</LINE>
<LINE>Am I both priest and clerk? Well then, amen.</LINE>
<LINE>God save the King! Although I be not he,</LINE>
<LINE>And yet amen, if heaven do think him me.</LINE>
<LINE>To do what service am I sent for hither?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To do that office of thine own good will</LINE>
<LINE>Which tired majesty did make thee offer:</LINE>
<LINE>The resignation of thy state and crown</LINE>
<LINE>To Henry Bullingbrook.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Give me the crown. Here, cousin, seize the crown;</LINE>
<LINE>Here, cousin,</LINE>
<LINE>On this side my hand, and on that side thine.</LINE>
<LINE>Now is this golden crown like a deep well</LINE>
<LINE>That owes two buckets, filling one another,</LINE>
<LINE>The emptier ever dancing in the air,</LINE>
<LINE>The other down, unseen, and full of water:</LINE>
<LINE>That bucket down and full of tears am I,</LINE>
<LINE>Drinking my griefs, whilst you mount up on high.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BULL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I thought you had been willing to resign.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My crown I am, but still my griefs are mine.</LINE>
<LINE>You may my glories and my state depose,</LINE>
<LINE>But not my griefs; still am I king of those.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BULL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Part of your cares you give me with your crown.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your cares set up do not pluck my cares down:</LINE>
<LINE>My care is loss of care, by old care done,</LINE>
<LINE>Your care is gain of care, by new care won;</LINE>
<LINE>The cares I give I have, though given away,</LINE>
<LINE>They tend the crown, yet still with me they stay.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BULL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Are you contented to resign the crown?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, no, no ay; for I must nothing be;</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore no no, for I resign to thee.</LINE>
<LINE>Now mark me how I will undo myself:</LINE>
<LINE>I give this heavy weight from off my head,</LINE>
<LINE>And this unwieldy sceptre from my hand,</LINE>
<LINE>The pride of kingly sway from out my heart;</LINE>
<LINE>With mine own tears I wash away my balm,</LINE>
<LINE>With mine own hands I give away my crown,</LINE>
<LINE>With mine own tongue deny my sacred state,</LINE>
<LINE>With mine own breath release all duteous oaths;</LINE>
<LINE>All pomp and majesty I do forswear;</LINE>
<LINE>My manors, rents, revenues I forgo;</LINE>
<LINE>My acts, decrees, and statutes I deny;</LINE>
<LINE>God pardon all oaths that are broke to me!</LINE>
<LINE>God keep all vows unbroke are made to thee!</LINE>
<LINE>Make me, that nothing have, with nothing griev&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>And thou with all pleas&#8217;d, that hast all achiev&#8217;d!</LINE>
<LINE>Long mayst thou live in Richard&#8217;s seat to sit,</LINE>
<LINE>And soon lie Richard in an earthy pit!</LINE>

<LINE>Must I do so? And must I ravel out</LINE>

<LINE>If thy offenses were upon record,</LINE>
<LINE>Would it not shame thee in so fair a troop</LINE>
<LINE>To read a lecture of them? If thou wouldst,</LINE>
<LINE>There shouldst thou find one heinous article,</LINE>
<LINE>Containing the deposing of a king,</LINE>
<LINE>And cracking the strong warrant of an oath,</LINE>
<LINE>Mark&#8217;d with a blot, damn&#8217;d in the book of heaven.</LINE>
<LINE>Nay, all of you that stand and look upon me</LINE>
<LINE>Whilst that my wretchedness doth bait myself,</LINE>
<LINE>Though some of you, with Pilate, wash your hands,</LINE>
<LINE>Showing an outward pity, yet you Pilates</LINE>

<LINE>But they can see a sort of traitors here.</LINE>
<LINE>Nay, if I turn mine eyes upon myself,</LINE>
<LINE>I find myself a traitor with the rest;</LINE>
<LINE>For I have given here my soul&#8217;s consent</LINE>
<LINE>T&#8217; undeck the pompous body of a king;</LINE>

<LINE>No, not that name was given me at the font,</LINE>

<LINE>That I have worn so many winters out</LINE>
<LINE>And know not now what name to call myself!</LINE>

<LINE>Standing before the sun of Bullingbrook,</LINE>

<LINE>Good king, great king, and yet not greatly good,</LINE>
<LINE>And if my word be sterling yet in England,</LINE>

<LINE>Give me that glass, and therein will I read.</LINE>
<LINE>No deeper wrinkles yet? Hath sorrow struck</LINE>
<LINE>So many blows upon this face of mine,</LINE>
<LINE>And made no deeper wounds? O flatt&#8217;ring glass,</LINE>
<LINE>Like to my followers in prosperity,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou dost beguile me! Was this face the face</LINE>
<LINE>That every day under his household roof</LINE>
<LINE>Did keep ten thousand men? Was this the face</LINE>
<LINE>That like the sun, did make beholders wink?</LINE>
<LINE>Is this the face which fac&#8217;d so many follies,</LINE>
<LINE>That was at last out-fac&#8217;d by Bullingbrook?</LINE>
<LINE>A brittle glory shineth in this face,</LINE>
<LINE>As brittle as the glory is the face,</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Dashes the glass against the ground.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>For there it is, crack&#8217;d in an hundred shivers.</LINE>

<LINE>&#8217;Tis very true, my grief lies all within,</LINE>
<LINE>And these external manners of laments</LINE>
<LINE>Are merely shadows to the unseen grief</LINE>
<LINE>That swells with silence in the tortur&#8217;d soul.</LINE>
<LINE>There lies the substance; and I thank thee, King,</LINE>
<LINE>For thy great bounty, that not only giv&#8217;st</LINE>
<LINE>Me cause to wail, but teachest me the way</LINE>
<LINE>How to lament the cause. I&#8217;ll beg one boon,</LINE>

<LINE>Doubly divorc&#8217;d! Bad men, you violate</LINE>
<LINE>A twofold marriage&#8212;&#8217;twixt my crown and me,</LINE>
<LINE>And then betwixt me and my married wife.&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Let me unkiss the oath &#8217;twixt thee and me;</LINE>
<LINE>And yet not so, for with a kiss &#8217;twas made.</LINE>
<LINE>Part us, Northumberland: I towards the north,</LINE>
<LINE>Where shivering cold and sickness pines the clime;</LINE>
<LINE>My wife to France, from whence set forth in pomp</LINE>
<LINE>She came adorned hither like sweet May,</LINE>
<LINE>Sent back like Hollowmas or short&#8217;st of day.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And must we be divided? Must we part?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, hand from hand, my love, and heart from heart.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Banish us both, and send the King with me.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NORTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That were some love, but little policy.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then whither he goes, thither let me go.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So two together weeping make one woe.</LINE>
<LINE>Weep thou for me in France, I for thee here;</LINE>
<LINE>Better far off than, near, be ne&#8217;er the near.</LINE>
<LINE>Go count thy way with sighs, I mine with groans.</LINE>

<LINE>So longest way shall have the longest moans.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Twice for one step I&#8217;ll groan, the way being short,</LINE>
<LINE>And piece the way out with a heavy heart.</LINE>
<LINE>Come, come, in wooing sorrow let&#8217;s be brief,</LINE>
<LINE>Since wedding it, there is such length in grief.</LINE>
<LINE>One kiss shall stop our mouths, and dumbly part;</LINE>
<LINE>Thus give I mine, and thus take I thy heart.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Give me mine own again, &#8217;twere no good part</LINE>
<LINE>To take on me to keep and kill thy heart.</LINE>
<LINE>So now I have mine own again, be gone,</LINE>
<LINE>That I may strive to kill it with a groan.</LINE>

<LINE>My lord, you told me you would tell the rest,</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Where did I leave?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUCH. YORK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">At that sad stop, my lord,</LINE>
<LINE>Where rude misgoverned hands from windows&#8217; tops</LINE>
<LINE>Threw dust and rubbish on King Richard&#8217;s head.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then, as I said, the Duke, great Bullingbrook,</LINE>
<LINE>Mounted upon a hot and fiery steed,</LINE>
<LINE>Which his aspiring rider seem&#8217;d to know,</LINE>
<LINE>With slow but stately pace kept on his course,</LINE>
<LINE>Whilst all tongues cried, &#8220;God save thee, Bullingbrook!&#8221;</LINE>
<LINE>You would have thought the very windows spake,</LINE>
<LINE>So many greedy looks of young and old</LINE>
<LINE>Through casements darted their desiring eyes</LINE>
<LINE>Upon his visage, and that all the walls</LINE>
<LINE>With painted imagery had said at once,</LINE>
<LINE>&#8220;Jesu preserve thee! Welcome, Bullingbrook!&#8221;</LINE>
<LINE>Whilst he, from the one side to the other turning,</LINE>
<LINE>Bare-headed, lower than his proud steed&#8217;s neck,</LINE>
<LINE>Bespake them thus: &#8220;I thank you, countrymen.&#8221;</LINE>

<LINE>As in a theatre the eyes of men,</LINE>
<LINE>After a well-graced actor leaves the stage,</LINE>
<LINE>Are idly bent on him that enters next,</LINE>
<LINE>Thinking his prattle to be tedious,</LINE>
<LINE>Even so, or with much more contempt, men&#8217;s eyes</LINE>
<LINE>Did scowl on gentle Richard. No man cried &#8220;God save him!&#8221;</LINE>
<LINE>No joyful tongue gave him his welcome home,</LINE>
<LINE>But dust was thrown upon his sacred head,</LINE>
<LINE>Which with such gentle sorrow he shook off,</LINE>
<LINE>His face still combating with tears and smiles,</LINE>
<LINE>The badges of his grief and patience,</LINE>
<LINE>That had not God, for some strong purpose, steel&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>The hearts of men, they must perforce have melted,</LINE>
<LINE>And barbarism itself have pitied him.</LINE>
<LINE>But heaven hath a hand in these events,</LINE>

<LINE>Sweet York, sweet husband, be not of that mind,</LINE>
<LINE>He is as like thee as a man may be,</LINE>

<LINE>His answer was, he would unto the stews,</LINE>

<LINE>Ah, my sour husband, my hard-hearted lord,</LINE>

<LINE>Speak &#8220;pardon&#8221; as &#8217;tis current in our land,</LINE>
<LINE>The chopping French we do not understand.</LINE>
<LINE>Thine eye begins to speak, set thy tongue there;</LINE>
<LINE>Or in thy piteous heart plant thou thine ear,</LINE>

<SCENEPERSONAE>(Richard, Groom of the Stable, Keeper, Exton, Servants)</SCENEPERSONAE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter Richard alone.</STAGEDIR>


<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have been studying how I may compare</LINE>
<LINE>This prison where I live unto the world;</LINE>
<LINE>And for because the world is populous,</LINE>
<LINE>And here is not a creature but myself,</LINE>
<LINE>I cannot do it; yet I&#8217;ll hammer it out.</LINE>
<LINE>My brain I&#8217;ll prove the female to my soul,</LINE>
<LINE>My soul the father, and these two beget</LINE>
<LINE>A generation of still-breeding thoughts;</LINE>
<LINE>And these some thoughts people this little world,</LINE>
<LINE>In humors like the people of this world:</LINE>
<LINE>For no thought is contented. The better sort,</LINE>
<LINE>As thoughts of things divine, are intermix&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>With scruples and do set the word itself</LINE>
<LINE>Against the word,</LINE>
<LINE>As thus: &#8220;Come, little ones,&#8221; and then again,</LINE>
<LINE>&#8220;It is as hard to come as for a camel</LINE>
<LINE>To thread the postern of a small needle&#8217;s eye.&#8221;</LINE>
<LINE>Thoughts tending to ambition, they do plot</LINE>
<LINE>Unlikely wonders: how these vain weak nails</LINE>
<LINE>May tear a passage thorough the flinty ribs</LINE>
<LINE>Of this hard world, my ragged prison walls;</LINE>
<LINE>And for they cannot, die in their own pride.</LINE>
<LINE>Thoughts tending to content flatter themselves</LINE>
<LINE>That they are not the first of fortune&#8217;s slaves,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor shall not be the last&#8212;like seely beggars</LINE>
<LINE>Who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame,</LINE>
<LINE>That many have and others must sit there;</LINE>
<LINE>And in this thought they find a kind of ease,</LINE>
<LINE>Bearing their own misfortunes on the back</LINE>
<LINE>Of such as have before endur&#8217;d the like.</LINE>
<LINE>Thus play I in one person many people,</LINE>
<LINE>And none contented. Sometimes am I king;</LINE>
<LINE>Then treasons make me wish myself a beggar,</LINE>
<LINE>And so I am. Then crushing penury</LINE>
<LINE>Persuades me I was better when a king;</LINE>
<LINE>Then am I king&#8217;d again, and by and by</LINE>
<LINE>Think that I am unking&#8217;d by Bullingbrook,</LINE>
<LINE>And straight am nothing. But what e&#8217;er I be,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor I, nor any man that but man is,</LINE>
<LINE>With nothing shall be pleas&#8217;d, till he be eas&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>With being nothing.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>The music plays.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE offset="5">Music do I hear?</LINE>
<LINE>Ha, ha, keep time! How sour sweet music is</LINE>
<LINE>When time is broke, and no proportion kept!</LINE>
<LINE>So is it in the music of men&#8217;s lives.</LINE>
<LINE>And here have I the daintiness of ear</LINE>
<LINE>To check time broke in a disordered string;</LINE>
<LINE>But for the concord of my state and time</LINE>
<LINE>Had not an ear to hear my true time broke.</LINE>
<LINE>I wasted time, and now doth time waste me;</LINE>
<LINE>For now hath time made me his numb&#8217;ring clock:</LINE>
<LINE>My thoughts are minutes, and with sighs they jar</LINE>
<LINE>Their watches on unto mine eyes, the outward watch,</LINE>
<LINE>Whereto my finger, like a dial&#8217;s point,</LINE>
<LINE>Is pointing still, in cleansing them from tears.</LINE>
<LINE>Now, sir, the sound that tells what hour it is</LINE>
<LINE>Are clamorous groans, which strike upon my heart,</LINE>
<LINE>Which is the bell. So sighs, and tears, and groans</LINE>
<LINE>Show minutes, times, and hours; but my time</LINE>
<LINE>Runs posting on in Bullingbrook&#8217;s proud joy,</LINE>
<LINE>While I stand fooling here, his Jack of the clock.</LINE>
<LINE>This music mads me, let it sound no more,</LINE>
<LINE>For though it have holp mad men to their wits,</LINE>
<LINE>In me it seems it will make wise men mad.</LINE>
<LINE>Yet blessing on his heart that gives it me!</LINE>
<LINE>For &#8217;tis a sign of love; and love to Richard</LINE>
<LINE>Is a strange brooch in this all-hating world.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter a Groom of the Stable.</STAGEDIR>


<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GROOM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hail, royal prince!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Thanks, noble peer!</LINE>
<LINE>The cheapest of us is ten groats too dear.</LINE>
<LINE>What art thou? And how comest thou hither,</LINE>
<LINE>Where no man never comes, but that sad dog</LINE>
<LINE>That brings me food to make misfortune live?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GROOM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I was a poor groom of thy stable, King,</LINE>
<LINE>When thou wert king; who, travelling towards York,</LINE>
<LINE>With much ado (at length) have gotten leave</LINE>
<LINE>To look upon my sometimes royal master&#8217;s face.</LINE>
<LINE>O how it ern&#8217;d my heart when I beheld</LINE>
<LINE>In London streets, that coronation-day,</LINE>
<LINE>When Bullingbrook rode on roan Barbary,</LINE>
<LINE>That horse that thou so often hast bestrid,</LINE>
<LINE>That horse that I so carefully have dress&#8217;d!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Rode he on Barbary? Tell me, gentle friend,</LINE>
<LINE>How went he under him?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GROOM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So proudly as if he disdain&#8217;d the ground.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So proud that Bullingbrook was on his back!</LINE>
<LINE>That jade hath eat bread from my royal hand,</LINE>
<LINE>This hand hath made him proud with clapping him.</LINE>
<LINE>Would he not stumble? Would he not fall down,</LINE>
<LINE>Since pride must have a fall, and break the neck</LINE>
<LINE>Of that proud man that did usurp his back?</LINE>
<LINE>Forgiveness, horse! Why do I rail on thee,</LINE>
<LINE>Since thou, created to be aw&#8217;d by man,</LINE>
<LINE>Wast born to bear? I was not made a horse,</LINE>
<LINE>And yet I bear a burden like an ass,</LINE>
<LINE>Spurr&#8217;d, gall&#8217;d, and tir&#8217;d by jauncing Bullingbrook.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>K. RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Taste of it first, as thou art wont to do.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KEEP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, I dare not. Sir Pierce of Exton, who</LINE>
<LINE>Lately came from the King, commands the contrary.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>The murderers, Exton and Servants, rush in armed.</STAGEDIR>


<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How now, what means death in this rude assault?</LINE>
<LINE>Villain, thy own hand yields thy death&#8217;s instrument,</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Snatches an axe from a Servant and kills him.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Go thou and fill another room in hell.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Kills another. Here Exton strikes him down.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>That hand shall burn in never-quenching fire</LINE>
<LINE>That staggers thus my person. Exton, thy fierce hand</LINE>
<LINE>Hath with the King&#8217;s blood stain&#8217;d the King&#8217;s own land.</LINE>
<LINE>Mount, mount, my soul! Thy seat is up on high,</LINE>
<LINE>Whilst my gross flesh sinks downward, here to die.</LINE>
</SPEECH>
<STAGEDIR>Dies.</STAGEDIR>


<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EXTON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As full of valure as of royal blood!</LINE>
<LINE>Both have I spill&#8217;d; O would the deed were good!</LINE>
<LINE>For now the devil that told me I did well</LINE>
<LINE>Says that this deed is chronicled in hell.</LINE>
<LINE>This dead king to the living king I&#8217;ll bear;</LINE>
<LINE>Take hence the rest, and give them burial here.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NORTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>First, to thy sacred state wish I all happiness.</LINE>
<LINE>The next news is, I have to London sent</LINE>
<LINE>The heads of Salisbury, Spencer, Blunt, and Kent.</LINE>
<LINE>The manner of their taking may appear</LINE>
<LINE>At large discoursed in this paper here.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>Thy kingly doom and sentence of his pride.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. HEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Carlisle, this is your doom:</LINE>
<LINE>Choose out some secret place, some reverent room,</LINE>
<LINE>More than thou hast, and with it joy thy life.</LINE>
<LINE>So as thou liv&#8217;st in peace, die free from strife,</LINE>
<LINE>For though mine enemy thou hast ever been,</LINE>
<LINE>High sparks of honor in thee have I seen.</LINE>
</SPEECH>
<STAGEDIR>Enter Exton with Attendants bearing the coffin.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EXTON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Great King, within this coffin I present</LINE>
<LINE>Thy buried fear. Herein all breathless lies</LINE>
<LINE>The mightiest of thy greatest enemies,</LINE>

<LINE>Exton, I thank thee not, for thou hast wrought</LINE>

<LINE>Upon my head and all this famous land.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EXTON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>From your own mouth, my lord, did I this deed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. HEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>They love not poison that do poison need,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor do I thee. Though I did wish him dead,</LINE>
<LINE>I hate the murderer, love him murdered.</LINE>
<LINE>The guilt of conscience take thou for thy labor,</LINE>
<LINE>But neither my good word nor princely favor.</LINE>
<LINE>With Cain go wander thorough shades of night,</LINE>
<LINE>And never show thy head by day nor light.</LINE>
<LINE>Lords, I protest my soul is full of woe</LINE>
<LINE>That blood should sprinkle me to make me grow.</LINE>
<LINE>Come mourn with me for what I do lament,</LINE>
<LINE>And put on sullen black incontinent.</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll make a voyage to the Holy Land,</LINE>
<LINE>To wash this blood off from my guilty hand.</LINE>
<LINE>March sadly after, grace my mournings here,</LINE>
