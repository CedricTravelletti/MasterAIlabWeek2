<persona gender="male">
<persname short="THE.">Theseus, Duke of Athens</persname>
<persdescription>Theseus is the Duke of Athens, a mighty warrior who has recently conquered the Amazons and is supposed to be marrying their Queen, Hippolyta. Interrupted on the way to the ceremony, he takes a great deal of convincing before he agrees to put his marriage off and go fight Creon instead. He believes that reason should rule over passion, and therefore in the end does as he is asked. Impressed by Palamon and Arcite&#8217;s valor in the war, he brings them back as prisoners and has them cured of their wounds. He shares a deep friendship with Pirithous, who is able to convince him to let Arcite go. He enjoys having entertainments presented to him by his subjects, and rewards them well. He has a hot temper at times, and is a bit inflexible about changing his mind after he swears something when he is in a rage. Hippolyta and Emilia are able to soften him, though, as he is in love with his wife and fond of his sister-in-law. He is however quick to arrange for the latter to marry a former prisoner of his, and takes little notice of her apparent uncertainty in the matter. He is a pious man. He is the same as the Theseus of <persnameref>A Midsummer Night&#8217;s Dream</persnameref>.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="PIR.">Pirithous</persname>
<persdescription>Pirithous is Theseus&#8217;s dearest friend, and has a great deal of influence on him. When Theseus decides to make war on Creon before marrying, Pirithous is charged with keeping the festivities going all the same before joining the Duke at the war. He is very fond of Emilia. His influence with Theseus is enough to get the latter to agree to release Arcite from prison. He is greatly impressed by strong, noble-looking men. He rushes to stop Palamon&#8217;s execution after he witnesses Arcite&#8217;s fatal accident.</persdescription>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="PAL.">Palamon</persname>
<persaliases>
	<persname short="BOTH. ARC. AND PAL.">Both Arcite and Palamon</persname>
</persaliases>
<persdescription>Palamon is a nephew of the tyrant Creon of Thebes. He neither likes nor approves of his uncle, and would leave his court and fight against him, were it not dishonorable. He is deeply attached to his cousin Arcite, his war-mate and best friend, and quite self-congratulatory about what good friends they are. The two are almost indistinguishable, both being just as self-involved, and both falling powerfully in love with Emilia merely at the sight of her. Palamon is gloomier than his cousin, and has more of a temper. He sings to himself when alone in prison, and is very kind to his Jailer&#8217;s Daughter, who tends to him &#8212; even kissing her once. When she offers to free him, he is concerned for her and her father, and does not respond to her declaration of love. He is appreciative of Arcite&#8217;s caring for him in the woods, but still only wishes to recover his strength so as to be able to fight his cousin. He chooses to pray to Venus, the goddess of Love, before his battle with Arcite, and though he loses the fight in the end he gains the lady. He is generous, and twice offers the Jailer money for his daughter&#8217;s dowry, as thanks for her freeing him; he also obtains from Theseus that neither Jailer nor Daughter be held to blame for his escape. He is quite cheerful about having his head chopped off after he loses the battle to Arcite. He insists throughout that he has first rights to Emilia, as he saw her a few seconds before Arcite did.</persdescription>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="ARC.">Arcite</persname>
<persaliases>
	<persname short="BOTH. ARC. AND PAL.">Both Arcite and Palamon</persname>
</persaliases>
<persdescription>Arcite is a nephew of the tyrant Creon of Thebes. He neither likes nor approves of his uncle, and would leave his court and fight against him, were it not dishonorable. He has a pretty face and black hair, and has had a number of casual flings in his time. He is deeply attached to his cousin Palamon, his war-mate and best friend, and quite self-congratulatory about what good friends they are. The two are almost indistinguishable, both being just as self-involved, and both falling powerfully in love with Emilia merely at the sight of her. Freed thanks to Pirithous&#8217;s pleading, but banished from Athens, he disguises himself to compete in the wrestling and racing organized for Emilia&#8217;s birthday, where he wins all the competitions. Becoming a servant to Emilia, he pities Palamon. He is slightly more affected and more cheery than his cousin, as well as more cautious. Despite the deadly rivalry between them, he files through Palamon&#8217;s chains and feeds him so that he will be in good shape to fight each other. He chooses to pray to Mars, the god of War, before his battle with Palamon, and wins the fight. However, he is thrown by his horse, and as he dies admits that since Palamon saw Emilia a few seconds before he did himself, his cousin&#8217;s claim is the more valid one.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="VAL.">Valerius</persname>
<persdescription>Valerius is a noble Theban who comes to bring Palamon and Arcite to Creon when the latter learns of Theseus&#8217;s attack. He warns the cousins to take their time, in the hopes that Creon will calm down before they arrive.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="HER.">Herald</persname>
<persdescription>A Herald is doing his job wandering the field of battle once it is over to identify the dead when he finds the gravely-wounded Arcite and Palamon there. He informs Theseus of their identity.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="JAIL.">Jailer</persname>
<persdescription>A Jailer (also called Keeper) is in charge of Theseus&#8217;s prison for high-ranking captives. This job has the potential for high income, as prisoners will pay their jailers for amenities, but unfortunately Theseus doesn&#8217;t send that many noble people to prison. At present the jail only contains Palamon and Arcite, and the Jailer is rather concerned with marrying off his daughter. Though courteous to his prisoners, he is quick to put them in chains if he&#8217;s worried about them. He is also terrified of blame when Palamon escapes. Not the most observant of men, he fails to realize at first that his daughter has lost her mind. He disapproves of premarital sex and though he accepts the Doctor&#8217;s cure, he is appalled at how far the Doctor is willing to let the Wooer go in his impersonation of Palamon. However, having to appear at the battle between Palamon and Arcite and their followers, he misses the Wooer and his daughter arranging to go to bed together. He brings Palamon and his followers to the block.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="WOOER.">Wooer to the Jailer&#8217;s Daughter</persname>
<persdescription>The Wooer is in love with the Jailer&#8217;s Daughter, and hopes to marry her. He is a little dim, and perhaps a little shy as well. He is not an imaginative man, and is worried that his inability to sing will make his impersonation of Palamon fail. He trusts the Doctor, however, especially when the latter convinces him that he should sleep with the Jailer&#8217;s Daughter if she seems to be in the mood for it.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="DOCT.">Doctor</persname>
<persdescription>A Doctor is consulted by the Jailer and his friends in the hopes of curing the Jailer&#8217;s Daughter&#8217;s madness. He finds it a most interesting case. Though not entirely certain that he can cure her, he decides that the world should join her in her madness to try and bring her out of it. He is much more concerned for his own success than for the believability of the Wooer&#8217;s impersonation of Palamon or for the Jailer&#8217;s concern for morality, and doesn&#8217;t much believe in 18-year-old girls&#8217; chastity anyway. He considers fathers who think their grown daughters are perfectly chaste to be fools.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="female">
<persname short="HIP.">Hippolyta</persname>
<persdescription>Hippolyta is the Queen of the Amazons, now marrying Theseus. She is a strong, athletic woman, an excellent fighter and huntress. She is moved enough by the pleas of the three Queens to kneel to Theseus to beg him to put off their wedding and fight Creon first. She is not emotional and does not cry, and is certain that Theseus loves her best in the world. She notices a man&#8217;s muscles more than his face. She begs for Theseus&#8217;s reprieve on Palamon and Arcite. She is very fond of her sister Emilia. She is the same as the Hippolyta of <persnameref>A Midsummer Night&#8217;s Dream</persnameref>.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="female">
<persname short="EMIL.">Emilia</persname>
<persdescription>Emilia is Hippolyta&#8217;s sister. Like her an Amazon, she has fought in battles with her sister. She is a kind and pitying woman. Still mourning the death of her childhood friend Flavina, she is convinced that she will never share a love as intense or as close as she had with the deceased girl. She enjoys gardens, though she is not fully acquainted with the names of all the flowers. She likes her brother-in-law Theseus, who organizes races and wrestling for her birthday. Emilia remains completely unaware that she has become the love-object of the two warring cousins Palamon and Arcite until she comes across them fighting each other to the death over her. She is appalled by this, and hopes to have them banished so that she will not have to deal with them again. She refuses to choose one over the other, both because she cannot see either as better than the other and because she does not wish to condemn one of them to death. She finds both as worthy as the other and does not know which one&#8217;s victory to hope for in the battle over her; she is also horrified that three other men will die simply because of her existence and beauty, and refuses to actually attend the fight. There is no sign that she actually loves either of them, and she has little reaction to the sudden change in husband at the end, though she pledges to keep the day of Arcite&#8217;s death as a memorial day to him for the rest of her life.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="female">
<persname short="DAUGH.">Jailer&#8217;s Daughter</persname>
<persdescription>The Jailer&#8217;s Daughter is 18, immature, romantic, and more than ready to lose her virginity. She takes care of the imprisoned Arcite and Palamon, bringing them their food and keeping the cell fresh, and falls completely in love with Palamon. She is aware that he is unlikely to marry her, given the differences in their social rank, but she nevertheless hopes to at least become his mistress. Her passion is so great that she risks her father&#8217;s life by freeing Palamon and leading him to the woods. She is worried then when he does not kiss her after she admits her love, and, lost in the woods, cold, hungry, unable to find him again, her wits become addled and she slowly loses her mind. She becomes very child-like, while at the same time harping on her physical desire for Palamon. She joins in with the morris dancers and then goes on her way. She picks flowers by a river, and when she sees the Wooer she was meant to marry, she jumps into the water and would drown if he did not jump in after and save her. She is calmed down when the Wooer pretends to be Palamon at the Doctor&#8217;s suggestion, and soon agrees to marry him. Whether she ever realizes that the man she takes to bed with her is not the one she is in love with is unknown.</persdescription>

<persname short="SCHOOL.">Gerrold</persname>
<persdescription>Gerrold is a schoolmaster, who organizes the morris dance to entertain Theseus. He is pompous, convinced of his superiority, given to Latin quotes, and somewhat over-the-top in the writing of his speech to the Duke. A true man of the theatre, he is horrified to find a cast member missing, and when the Jailer&#8217;s mad Daughter wanders in, he quickly drafts her into his cast instead of helping her. He is wooing the tanner&#8217;s daughter.</persdescription>

<persdescription>Prologue/Epilogue comes forward on behalf of the acting company to talk to the audience at the beginning and end of the play. In colloquial language and a few dirty jokes, he begs the audience to like the play, if only out of fear of making Chaucer (who wrote the original story the play is based on) roll over in his grave. He is uncertain at the end whether the company has succeeded in pleasing the audience, but reminds them that it&#8217;s only a story, after all, and was only made to entertain.</persdescription>

<scenedescription>Theseus&#8217;s spectacular wedding procession is interrupted when three Queens in mourning throw themselves at his feet and those of his bride Hippolyta and her sister Emilia. They tell him of how their husbands were killed by the evil Creon, duke of Thebes, who will not allow them even to bury their lords. They beg Theseus to help them revenge their loss. Theseus recognizes them from happier times, but is uncertain about going to war against Creon. They plead to Hippolyta and Emilia to add their voices to their plea. Theseus wishes to proceed with the wedding ceremony, but the Queens continue to beg, and he finally agrees to fight on their behalf. The Queens tell him that it would be a good time to attack, for Creon will not expect it and is resting on his laurels. Theseus orders Artesius to arrange the campaign, while he goes on to get married. The Queens urge him to go himself, fearful that in the joy of getting married he will forget about them.

<scenelocation>Athens. A garden, with a prison in the background.</scenelocation>
<scenepersonae>(Jailer, Wooer, Daughter, Palamon, Arcite)</scenepersonae>
<scenedescription>The Jailer is talking with his daughter&#8217;s Wooer, and assures him that she will inherit all he has on his death. All that is lacking for the two young folk to marry is for the Wooer to get her consent. The Jailer&#8217;s Daughter comes in with new rushes for the floor of Palamon and Arcite&#8217;s cell. The Jailer mentions that once all the hustle and bustle at the court is over, they shall get on with this whole marrying business. Father and daughter begin to discuss the prisoners, and it is soon clear that the girl has been paying a great deal of attention to them. When the two appear at their prison window, she is able to identify which is which, unlike her father. The Jailer tells her to stop pointing and they all leave to avoid being seen.</scenedescription>

<line form="prose">I may depart with little, while I live; something I may cast to you, not much. Alas, the prison I keep, though it be for great ones, yet they seldom come: before one salmon, you shall take a number of minnows. I am given out to be better lin&#8217;d than it can appear to me report is a true speaker. I would I were really that I am deliver&#8217;d to be. Marry, what I have (be it what it will) I will assure upon my daughter at the day of my death.</line>

<speaker>DAUGH.</speaker>
<line form="prose">These strewings are for their chamber. &#8217;Tis pity they are in prison, and &#8217;twere pity they should be out. I do think they have patience to make any adversity asham&#8217;d. The prison itself is proud of &#8217;em; and they have all the world in their chamber.</line>

<speaker>DAUGH.</speaker>
<line form="prose">Nay, most likely, for they are noble suff&#8217;rers. I marvel how they would have look&#8217;d had they been victors, that with such a constant nobility enforce a freedom out of bondage, making misery their mirth, and affliction a toy to jest at.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>DAUGH.</speaker>
<line form="prose">It seems to me they have no more sense of their captivity than I of ruling Athens. They eat well, look merrily, discourse of many things, but nothing of their own restraint and disasters. Yet sometime a divided sigh, martyr&#8217;d as &#8217;twere i&#8217; th&#8217; deliverance, will break from one of them; when the other presently gives it so sweet a rebuke that I could wish myself a sigh to be so chid, or at least a sigher to be comforted.</line>

<scenelocation>The prison.</scenelocation>
<scenepersonae>(Palamon, Arcite, Emilia, Woman, Jailer)</scenepersonae>
<scenedescription>Palamon and Arcite are convinced that they will be prisoners for the rest of their lives, and therefore resolve to make the best of things. Though regretting that they will no longer be able to fight or hunt, and will never marry, they are convinced that since they are together they will be able to survive their time in jail. Arcite praises prison as a way to escape from the evils of the world, and Palamon quite agree. Very self-satisfied, they congratulate themselves on their wisdom and on the strength of their friendship, vowing that nothing shall ever part them. At that moment Emilia and her waiting-woman appear in the garden below, and as she discussed the flowers, both men fall quite head-over-heels for her, with predictable results. They fall to arguing over which one of them has the best right to woo her, Palamon with the deep argument that he saw her first, Arcite with the fact that he saw her as well. They are soon well on the way to mutual hatred, insulting and threatening one another, and vowing to achieve the lady in the other&#8217;s despite. The Jailer arrives with orders to bring Arcite to Theseus. Palamon is paranoid that Arcite may have been called for to marry Emilia. The Jailer returns to inform Palamon that Arcite has been set at liberty, on condition that he leave Athenian ground forever. Palamon envies him, as he will have opportunities of coming to Emilia&#8217;s attention. The jailer&#8217;s orders for Palamon, by contrast, are to move him to a new cell where he will not have a view of the garden. He absolutely refuses, but the Jailer insists, and chains him up even more heavily for the forced journey. Seeing there is no way around it, Palamon gives in, bidding farewell to Emilia.</scenedescription>

Arcite asks them where they&#8217;re going, and they explain, though some of them have a very poor opinion of the ignorant man.

<line form="verse">Lord, what a coil he keeps! To hear him</line>
<line form="verse">Sing in an evening, what a heaven it is!</line>

<line form="verse">Was never gentleman. When I come in</line>

<line form="verse">He bows his noble body, then salutes me thus:</line>

<line form="verse">Get thee a happy husband!&#8221; Once he kiss&#8217;d me&#8212;</line>
<line form="verse">I lov&#8217;d my lips the better ten days after.</line>
<line form="verse">Would he would do so ev&#8217;ry day! He grieves much,</line>
<line form="verse">And me as much to see his misery.</line>
<line form="verse">What should I do to make him know I love him,</line>
<line form="verse">For I would fain enjoy him? Say I ventur&#8217;d</line>
<line form="verse">To set him free? What says the law then?</line>

<scenedescription>Theseus congratulates the disguised Arcite for his victory in the contests, and questions him about himself. Pirithous, Hippolyta and Emilia are all quite impressed by him. Asked why he has come to Athens, Arcite replies that he hopes to seek fame in Theseus&#8217;s fortune, and the Duke charges Pirithous to find Arcite a place. To Arcite&#8217;s ill-concealed delight, Pirithous assigns him to Emilia&#8217;s service.  They arrange for him to choose a horse, and Theseus commands the court to be ready the next day for the May rites to Diana in the woods. Theseus comments to his sister-in-law that were he a woman, he would quite fall for; she replies that she is too wise to let that happen.</scenedescription>

<scenedescription>The court of Athens goes a-maying. Arcite congratulates himself on how well things are going, and pities Palamon, locked up in jail and unable to sneak his way into Emilia&#8217;s favors. Enraged, Palamon emerges from the bush where he has been hiding, still in chains, and rages against Arcite as a traitor. Arcite tries unsuccessfully to calm him down, and finally promises to duel with Palamon to clear his name. Palamon doubts that a traitor can still be any good with a sword. He swears to stand up to Arcite, so long as he has some weapons and some food to get his strength back. Arcite tells him to hide again, promising to bring him these things. Palamon is touched at this nobility. They hear the horns of the court, and Palamon hides again. They promise to meet again.</scenedescription>

<scenepersonae>(Palamon, Arcite, Theseus, Hippolyta, Emilia, Pirithous)</scenepersonae>
<scenedescription>Palamon, restored to health, waits impatiently for Arcite to return. Arcite arrives, carrying two sets of armor and two swords. They help each other to arm, bringing up old memories and chatting as they do so. Prepared to fight, they say farewell to one another, each forgiving the other in advance for killing them. As they begin to fight, the hunting horns of Theseus are heard; Arcite breaks off the fight, for both of them will be executed if the Duke catches them. Palamon refuses to hide, accusing his cousin of cowardice, and they begin to fight again. Theseus and the hunt enter, and the Duke orders the fight to be broken up; incensed that anybody should be dueling without his permission, he swears both shall die. Palamon reveals his identity and Arcite&#8217;s and explains the cause of their battle, begging for permission to continue. Theseus remind sthem that he has sworn their deaths; Arcite points out that they are not asking for mercy, merely for the chance to kill each other themselves. Hippolyta is horrified that her sister will be blamed for the cousins&#8217; deaths, and though Emilia refuses to take the blame for their falling in love with her, both sisters kneel and beg for the cousins&#8217; lives, asking Theseus that they merely be banished. Theseus points out that it is obvious that if banished, they will simply find each other and kill one another at some other time, and again points to his oath to have them executed. Emilia argues that the oath was spoken in anger and that the Duke can therefore not be held to it. She begs again that they be banished, having sworn that they will never fight over her again. Neither man will accept to take that oath, however. Theseus proposes that Emilia choose one of them as husband, and that the other be executed. Emilia, however, cannot decide between them. Theseus orders the two knights to return in a month with three friends each to fight it out, the victor to marry Emilia and the loser (and friends) to be executed. They agree, and Emilia, seeing no other option, does as well.</scenedescription>

<scenepersonae>(Jailer, Two Friends, Wooer, Jailer&#8217;s Brother, Daughter)</scenepersonae>
<scenedescription>Very concerned, the Jailer asks his friends whether there was any mention of Palamon&#8217;s escape when he was found. His friend reassures him that it is unlikely anyone will remember that matter, and that the Jailer is probably safe. Another friend arrives to reassure the Jailer that Palamon has cleared him of all blame, as well as obtaining a pardon for the Jailer&#8217;s Daughter and promising to give her a large sum of money on her wedding day. The agitated Wooer arrives to ask the Jailer about his daughter; the Jailer reflects that she was speaking oddly. The Wooer has to tell him that the girl is clearly mad: he saw her talking to the trees about Palamon, and witnessed her throw herself into the river. He saved her, but she has escaped from him. The Jailer&#8217;s Brother brings the Daughter in, still singing madly. They talk to her gently, agreeing with everything she says as she discusses Palamon and his faithlessness. She comes to believe that she is on a ship and directs them to sail towards Palamon; they all join in her imaginings. She begins to sing and they follow her as she walks away.</scenedescription>

<speech>
<speaker>WOOER.</speaker>
<line form="verse">I&#8217;ll tell you quickly. As I late was angling</line>
<line form="verse">In the great lake that lies behind the palace,</line>
<line form="verse">From the far shore, thick set with reeds and sedges,</line>
<line form="verse">As patiently I was attending sport,</line>
<line form="verse">I heard a voice, a shrill one; and attentive</line>
<line form="verse">I gave my ear, when I might well perceive</line>
<line form="verse">&#8217;Twas one that sung, and by the smallness of it,</line>
<line form="verse">A boy or woman. I then left my angle</line>
<line form="verse">To his own skill, came near, but yet perceiv&#8217;d not</line>
<line form="verse">Who made the sound, the rushes and the reeds</line>
<line form="verse">Had so encompass&#8217;d it. I laid me down</line>
<line form="verse">And list&#8217;ned to the words she sung, for then</line>
<line form="verse">Through a small glade cut by the fishermen,</line>
<line form="verse">I saw it was your daughter.</line>

<speaker>JAIL.</speaker>
<line form="verse" offset="5">Pray go on, sir.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WOOER.</speaker>
<line form="verse">She sung much, but no sense; only I heard her</line>
<line form="verse">Repeat this often, &#8220;Palamon is gone,</line>
<line form="verse">Is gone to th&#8217; wood to gather mulberries.</line>
<line form="verse">I&#8217;ll find him out tomorrow.&#8221;</line>

<speech>
<speaker>WOOER.</speaker>
<line form="verse">&#8220;His shackles will betray him, he&#8217;ll be taken,</line>
<line form="verse">And what shall I do then? I&#8217;ll bring a bevy,</line>
<line form="verse">A hundred black-ey&#8217;d maids that love as I do,</line>
<line form="verse">With chaplets on their heads of daffadillies,</line>
<line form="verse">With cherry lips and cheeks of damask roses,</line>
<line form="verse">And all we&#8217;ll dance an antic &#8217;fore the Duke,</line>
<line form="verse">And beg his pardon.&#8221; Then she talk&#8217;d of you, sir:</line>
<line form="verse">That you must lose your head tomorrow morning,</line>
<line form="verse">And she must gather flowers to bury you,</line>
<line form="verse">And see the house made handsome. Then she sung</line>
<line form="verse">Nothing but &#8220;Willow, willow, willow,&#8221; and between</line>
<line form="verse">Ever was &#8220;Palamon, fair Palamon,&#8221;</line>
<line form="verse">And &#8220;Palamon was a tall young man.&#8221; The place</line>
<line form="verse">Was knee-deep where she sat; her careless tresses</line>
<line form="verse">A wreath of bulrush rounded; about her stuck</line>
<line form="verse">Thousand fresh water-flowers of several colors,</line>
<line form="verse">That methought she appear&#8217;d like the fair nymph</line>
<line form="verse">That feeds the lake with waters, or as Iris</line>
<line form="verse">Newly dropp&#8217;d down from heaven. Rings she made</line>
<line form="verse">Of rushes that grew by, and to &#8217;em spoke</line>
<line form="verse">The prettiest posies&#8212;&#8220;Thus our true love&#8217;s tied,&#8221;</line>
<line form="verse">&#8220;This you may loose, not me,&#8221; and many a one;</line>
<line form="verse">And then she wept, and sung again, and sigh&#8217;d,</line>
<line form="verse">And with the same breath smil&#8217;d, and kiss&#8217;d her hand.</line>

<line form="verse">With such a cry and swiftness that, believe me,</line>
<line form="verse">She left me far behind her. Three or four</line>

<line form="verse">With all her best endowments, all those beauties</line>
<line form="verse">She sows into the births of noble bodies,</line>
<line form="verse">Were here a mortal woman, and had in her</line>
<line form="verse">The coy denials of young maids, yet doubtless</line>
<line form="verse">She would run mad for this man. What an eye,</line>
<line form="verse">Of what a fiery sparkle and quick sweetness,</line>
<line form="verse">Has this young prince! Here Love himself sits smiling.</line>
<line form="verse">Just such another wanton Ganymede</line>
<line form="verse">Set Jove afire with, and enforc&#8217;d the god</line>
<line form="verse">Snatch up the goodly boy and set him by him,</line>
<line form="verse">A shining constellation. What a brow,</line>
<line form="verse">Of what a spacious majesty, he carries,</line>
<line form="verse">Arch&#8217;d like the great-ey&#8217;d Juno&#8217;s, but far sweeter,</line>
<line form="verse">Smoother than Pelops&#8217; shoulder! Fame and Honor</line>
<line form="verse">Methinks from hence, as from a promontory</line>
<line form="verse">Pointed in heaven, should clap their wings and sing</line>

<line form="verse">As if he had lost his mother; a still temper,</line>
<line form="verse">No stirring in him, no alacrity,</line>
<line form="verse">Of all this sprightly sharpness, not a smile.</line>
<line form="verse">Yet these that we count errors may become him:</line>
<line form="verse">Narcissus was a sad boy, but a heavenly.</line>
<line form="verse">O, who can find the bent of woman&#8217;s fancy?</line>
<line form="verse">I am a fool, my reason is lost in me;</line>
<line form="verse">I have no choice, and I have lied so lewdly</line>
<line form="verse">That women ought to beat me. On my knees</line>
<line form="verse">I ask thy pardon: Palamon, thou art alone</line>
<line form="verse">And only beautiful, and these the eyes,</line>
<line form="verse">These the bright lamps of beauty, that command</line>
<line form="verse">And threaten Love, and what young maid dare cross &#8217;em?</line>
<line form="verse">What a bold gravity, and yet inviting,</line>
<line form="verse">Has this brown manly face! O Love, this only</line>
<line form="verse">From this hour is complexion. Lie there, Arcite,</line>
<line form="verse">Thou art a changeling to him, a mere gypsy,</line>
<line form="verse">And this the noble body. I am sotted,</line>
<line form="verse">Utterly lost. My virgin&#8217;s faith has fled me;</line>
<line form="verse">For if my brother but even now had ask&#8217;d me</line>
<line form="verse">Whether I lov&#8217;d, I had run mad for Arcite;</line>
<line form="verse">Now if my sister&#8212;more for Palamon.</line>

<line form="verse">And truly what I think. Six braver spirits</line>
<line form="verse">Than these they have brought (if we judge by the outside)</line>
<line form="verse">I never saw nor read of. He that stands</line>
<line form="verse">In the first place with Arcite, by his seeming</line>
<line form="verse">Should be a stout man, by his face a prince</line>
<line form="verse">(His very looks so say him), his complexion</line>
<line form="verse">Nearer a brown than black; stern, and yet noble,</line>
<line form="verse">Which shows him hardy, fearless, proud of dangers.</line>
<line form="verse">The circles of his eyes show fire within him,</line>
<line form="verse">And as a heated lion, so he looks;</line>
<line form="verse">His hair hangs long behind him, black and shining</line>
<line form="verse">Like ravens&#8217; wings; his shoulders broad and strong,</line>
<line form="verse">Arm&#8217;d long and round, and on his thigh a sword</line>
<line form="verse">Hung by a curious baldrick, when he frowns</line>
<line form="verse">To seal his will with. Better, o&#8217; my conscience,</line>

<line form="verse">He&#8217;s somewhat bigger than the knight he spoke of,</line>
<line form="verse">But of a face far sweeter; his complexion</line>
<line form="verse">Is, as a ripe grape, ruddy. He has felt</line>
<line form="verse">Without doubt what he fights for, and so apter</line>
<line form="verse">To make this cause his own. In &#8217;s face appears</line>
<line form="verse">All the fair hopes of what he undertakes,</line>
<line form="verse">And when he&#8217;s angry, then a settled valor</line>
<line form="verse">(Not tainted with extremes) runs through his body,</line>
<line form="verse">And guides his arm to brave things. Fear he cannot,</line>
<line form="verse">He shows no such soft temper. His head&#8217;s yellow,</line>
<line form="verse">Hard-hair&#8217;d, and curl&#8217;d, thick twin&#8217;d like ivy-tods,</line>
<line form="verse">Not to undo with thunder. In his face</line>
<line form="verse">The livery of the warlike maid appears,</line>
<line form="verse">Pure red and white, for yet no beard has blest him;</line>
<line form="verse">And in his rolling eyes sits victory,</line>
<line form="verse">As if she ever meant to crown his valor.</line>

<line form="verse">Not wanton white, but such a manly color</line>
<line form="verse">Next to an auburn; tough and nimble set,</line>
<line form="verse">Which shows an active soul; his arms are brawny,</line>
<line form="verse">Lin&#8217;d with strong sinews; to the shoulder-piece</line>
<line form="verse">Gently they swell, like women new conceiv&#8217;d,</line>
<line form="verse">Which speaks him prone to labor, never fainting</line>
<line form="verse">Under the weight of arms; stout-hearted, still,</line>
<line form="verse">But when he stirs, a tiger. He&#8217;s grey-ey&#8217;d,</line>

<line form="verse">To spy advantages, and where he finds &#8217;em,</line>
<line form="verse">He&#8217;s swift to make &#8217;em his. He does no wrongs,</line>
<line form="verse">Nor takes none. He&#8217;s round-fac&#8217;d, and when he smiles</line>
<line form="verse">He shows a lover, when he frowns, a soldier.</line>
<line form="verse">About his head he wears the winner&#8217;s oak,</line>
<line form="verse">And in it stuck the favor of his lady.</line>

The Daughter herself enters and the Doctor gets to hear her babbling for himself. He admits that he cannot fix her brain, but on hearing that there was a man in the picture before Palamon, suggests that they trick her. Namely, the Wooer should dress up like Palamon and act like him, and in all things pretend to be him, in the hopes that over time she will regain her wits and realize it&#8217;s actually the Wooer.</scenedescription>

They may return and settle again to execute their preordain&#8217;d faculties, but they are now in a most extravagant vagary. This you must do: confine her to a place where the light may rather seem to steal in than be permitted. Take upon you, young sir her friend, the name of Palamon, say you come to eat with her, and to commune of love. This will catch her attention, for this her mind beats upon; other objects that are inserted &#8217;tween her mind and eye become the pranks and friskins of her madness. Sing to her such green songs of love as she says Palamon hath sung in prison. Come to her, stuck in as sweet flowers as the season is mistress of, and thereto make an addition of some other compounded odors which are grateful to the sense. All this shall become Palamon, for Palamon can sing, and Palamon is sweet, and ev&#8217;ry good thing. Desire to eat with her, carve her, drink to her, and still among intermingle your petition of grace and acceptance into her favor. Learn what maids have been her companions and play-feres, and let them repair to her with Palamon in their mouths, and appear with tokens, as if they suggested for him. It is a falsehood she is in, which is with falsehoods to be combated. This may bring her to eat, to sleep, and reduce what&#8217;s now out of square in her into their former law and regiment. I have seen it approv&#8217;d, how many times I know not, but to make the number more I have great hope in this. I will, between the passages of this project, come in with my appliance.

<scenedescription>Theseus orders the opponents to make their sacrifices to the gods before beginning, and wishes them all well. Palamon and Arcite say farewell to one another one last time, regretful that things have come to this but refusing to back down. They embrace. Arcite and his knights worship at the altar of Mars, the god of War, and are rewarded with a clap of thunder and the sounds of war. They take this as a good sign and go to prepare for the battle. Palamon and his knights approach the altar of Venus, Goddess of Love, and are rewarded by music and a flight of doves, which they take as auspicious signs. Lastly, Emilia approaches the altar of Diana, the Virgin Goddess of the Hunt, offering her last services as a vestal and asking, since she cannot decide for herself, that whichever of the two knights loves her best win. A rose tree bearing a single rose rises for behind the altar, and the rose falls off. Emilia is uncertain of what this may portend.</scenedescription>

<scenepersonae>(Doctor, Jailer, Wooer, Daughter, Maid, First Messenger)</scenepersonae>
<scenedescription>The Wooer reports that the Jailer&#8217;s Daughter is half-convinced that he is indeed Palamon. The Doctor approves and tells him to carry on, going as far as is needed; the Jailer protests when the Doctor suggests that they even go to bed together without having been married. When the Jailer goes out to fetch his daughter, the Doctor comments on the foolishness of fathers, remarking that whether or not the Jailer&#8217;s Daughter is honest has nothing to do with curing her. The Wooer agrees. The Jailer and his Daughter return, she discussing all of Palamon&#8217;s wonderful features. The Wooer advances and, pretending to be Palamon, agrees to marry her. They kiss, and she is eager for the night to begin. The Doctor pretends to be Arcite complimenting Palamon on his choice. A Messenger calls the Jailer to go to the tournament, and the Doctor follows along, not wishing to miss it; he guarantees that he will have the Daughter cured in a few more days. He advises the Wooer not to leave her alone, and to agree to her request for kisses, playing cards, and going to bed together. The Wooer promises not to hurt her.</scenedescription>

<scenedescription>Emilia refuses to witness the fight. Both Theseus and Hippolyta insist that she must, as she is the object of the fight, but she will not budge. In the end they let her be. Left alone, Emilia still considers the differences between the two knights. The fighting is heard in the distance. Hearing cries that Palamon has won, she sends servants to confirm this, but they reports that though he had almost won, he was beaten back, and the fight is continuing. Soon more shouting is heard, and Arcite&#8217;s victory reported. Emilia grieves for Palamon. Theseus arrives with the court and Arcite, and gives him to her. Theseus praises Arcite to the skies, but Emilia finds no mercy in the situation.</scenedescription>

<scenedescription>Palamon and his knights prepare for their execution. Palamon asks the Jailer, who is in charge of the event, how his Daughter is doing, and on hearing that she is better and soon to be married gives the Jailer his purse for her. The other knights add their purses to her dowry as well. Palamon, as the first to die, lays his head on the block, but a messenger runs in to stop the execution: Arcite has been thrown by his horse and lies dying. He is borne in and tells Palamon to take Emilia, admitting that though he was no traitor, he was false to his cousin, and thus deserves this end. He takes one kiss from Emilia and dies. Theseus comments that the gods would have it so – Mars gave the victory to the one who prayed to him, but Venus gave the woman to he who prayed to her. The Duke reports that Arcite admitted that Palamon had first rights to Emilia, as he saw her first. He calls for a day or two of mourning and Arcite&#8217;s funeral before the wedding takes place, and comments on how they are the playthings of the gods.</scenedescription>

<line form="verse" offset="7">List then: your cousin,</line>
<line form="verse">Mounted upon a steed that Emily</line>
<line form="verse">Did first bestow on him&#8212;a black one, owing</line>
<line form="verse">Not a hair-worth of white, which some will say</line>
<line form="verse">Weakens his price, and many will not buy</line>
<line form="verse">His goodness with this note; which superstition</line>
<line form="verse">Here finds allowance&#8212;on this horse is Arcite</line>
<line form="verse">Trotting the stones of Athens, which the calkins</line>
<line form="verse">Did rather tell than trample; for the horse</line>
<line form="verse">Would make his length a mile, if&#8217;t pleas&#8217;d his rider</line>
<line form="verse">To put pride in him. As he thus went counting</line>

<line form="verse">Took toy at this, and fell to what disorder</line>
<line form="verse">His power could give his will, bounds, comes on end,</line>
<line form="verse">Forgets school-doing, being therein train&#8217;d,</line>
<line form="verse">And of kind manage; pig-like he whines</line>
<line form="verse">At the sharp rowel, which he frets at rather</line>
<line form="verse">Than any jot obeys; seeks all foul means</line>
<line form="verse">Of boist&#8217;rous and rough jad&#8217;ry, to disseat</line>
<line form="verse">His lord that kept it bravely. When nought serv&#8217;d,</line>
<line form="verse">When neither curb would crack, girth break, nor diff&#8217;ring plunges</line>
<line form="verse">Disroot his rider whence he grew, but that</line>
<line form="verse">He kept him &#8217;tween his legs, on his hind hoofs</line>
<line form="verse">On end he stands,</line>
<line form="verse">That Arcite&#8217;s legs, being higher than his head,</line>
<line form="verse">Seem&#8217;d with strange art to hang. His victor&#8217;s wreath</line>
<line form="verse">Even then fell off his head; and presently</line>
<line form="verse">Backward the jade comes o&#8217;er, and his full poise</line>
<line form="verse">Becomes the rider&#8217;s load. Yet is he living,</line>
<line form="verse">But such a vessel &#8217;tis that floats but for</line>
<line form="verse">The surge that next approaches. He much desires</line>
