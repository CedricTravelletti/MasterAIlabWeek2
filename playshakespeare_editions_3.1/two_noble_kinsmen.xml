<LINE>New plays and maidenheads are near akin&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Much follow&#8217;d both, for both much money gi&#8217;n,</LINE>
<LINE>If they stand sound and well; and a good play</LINE>
<LINE>(Whose modest scenes blush on his marriage-day,</LINE>
<LINE>And shake to lose his honor) is like her</LINE>
<LINE>That after holy tie and first night&#8217;s stir,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet still is modesty, and still retains</LINE>
<LINE>More of the maid to sight than husband&#8217;s pains.</LINE>
<LINE>We pray our play may be so; for I am sure</LINE>
<LINE>It has a noble breeder and a pure,</LINE>
<LINE>A learned, and a poet never went</LINE>
<LINE>More famous yet &#8217;twixt Po and silver Trent.</LINE>
<LINE>Chaucer (of all admir&#8217;d) the story gives;</LINE>
<LINE>There constant to eternity it lives.</LINE>
<LINE>If we let fall the nobleness of this,</LINE>
<LINE>And the first sound this child hear be a hiss,</LINE>
<LINE>How will it shake the bones of that good man,</LINE>
<LINE>And make him cry from under ground, &#8220;O, fan</LINE>
<LINE>From me the witless chaff of such a writer</LINE>
<LINE>That blasts my bays and my fam&#8217;d works makes lighter</LINE>
<LINE>Than Robin Hood!&#8221; This is the fear we bring;</LINE>
<LINE>For to say truth, it were an endless thing,</LINE>
<LINE>And too ambitious, to aspire to him,</LINE>
<LINE>Weak as we are, and almost breathless swim</LINE>
<LINE>In this deep water. Do but you hold out</LINE>
<LINE>Your helping hands, and we shall tack about</LINE>
<LINE>And something do to save us. You shall hear</LINE>
<LINE>Scenes, though below his art, may yet appear</LINE>
<LINE>Worth two hours&#8217; travail. To his bones sweet sleep!</LINE>
<LINE>Content to you! If this play do not keep</LINE>
<LINE>A little dull time from us, we perceive</LINE>
<LINE>Our losses fall so thick we must needs leave.</LINE>

<SCENEPERSONAE>(Hymen, Boy, Nymphs, Theseus, Hippolyta, Pirithous, Emilia, Artesius, Attendants, Three Queens)</SCENEPERSONAE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Hymen with a torch burning; a Boy, in a white robe, before, singing and strewing flow&#8217;rs; after Hymen, a Nymph, encompass&#8217;d in her tresses, bearing a wheaten garland; then Theseus, between two other Nymphs with wheaten chaplets an their heads; then Hippolyta, the bride, led by Pirithous, and another holding a garland over her head (her tresses likewise hanging; after her, Emilia, holding up her train; Artesius and Attendants.</STAGEDIR>

<STAGEDIR>Music. The Song by the Boy.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE type="lyric">Roses, their sharp spines being gone,</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">Not royal in their smells alone,</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">But in their hue;</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">Maiden pinks, of odor faint,</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">Daisies smell-less, yet most quaint,</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">And sweet thyme true;</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">Primrose, first-born child of Ver,</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">Merry spring-time&#8217;s harbinger,</LINE>

<LINE type="lyric">Larks&#8217;-heels trim;</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">All dear Nature&#8217;s children sweet,</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">Lie &#8217;fore bride and bridegroom&#8217;s feet.</LINE>

<LINE type="lyric">May on our bridehouse perch or sing,</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">Or with them any discord bring,</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">But from it fly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter three Queens, in black, with veils stain&#8217;d, with imperial crowns. The first Queen falls down at the foot of Theseus; the second falls down at the foot of Hippolyta; the third before Emilia.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For pity&#8217;s sake and true gentility&#8217;s,</LINE>
<LINE>Hear and respect me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">For your mother&#8217;s sake,</LINE>
<LINE>And as you wish your womb may thrive with fair ones,</LINE>
<LINE>Hear and respect me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>3. QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now for the love of him whom Jove hath mark&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>The honor of your bed, and for the sake</LINE>
<LINE>Of clear virginity, be advocate</LINE>
<LINE>For us and our distresses! This good deed</LINE>
<LINE>Shall raze you out o&#8217; th&#8217; book of trespasses</LINE>
<LINE>All you are set down there.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sad lady, rise.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HIP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="3">Stand up.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EMIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">No knees to me.</LINE>
<LINE>What woman I may stead that is distress&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>Does bind me to her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What&#8217;s your request? Deliver you for all.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We are three queens, whose sovereigns fell before</LINE>
<LINE>The wrath of cruel Creon; who endured</LINE>
<LINE>The beaks of ravens, talents of the kites,</LINE>
<LINE>And pecks of crows in the foul fields of Thebes.</LINE>
<LINE>He will not suffer us to bum their bones,</LINE>
<LINE>To urn their ashes, nor to take th&#8217; offense</LINE>
<LINE>Of mortal loathsomeness from the blest eye</LINE>
<LINE>Of holy Phoebus, but infects the winds</LINE>
<LINE>With stench of our slain lords. O, pity, Duke,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou purger of the earth, draw thy fear&#8217;d sword</LINE>
<LINE>That does good turns to th&#8217; world; give us the bones</LINE>
<LINE>Of our dead kings, that we may chapel them;</LINE>
<LINE>And of thy boundless goodness take some note</LINE>
<LINE>That for our crowned heads we have no roof,</LINE>
<LINE>Save this which is the lion&#8217;s, and the bear&#8217;s,</LINE>
<LINE>And vault to every thing!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Pray you kneel not;</LINE>
<LINE>I was transported with your speech, and suffer&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>Your knees to wrong themselves. I have heard the fortunes</LINE>
<LINE>Of your dead lords, which gives me such lamenting</LINE>
<LINE>As wakes my vengeance and revenge for &#8217;em.</LINE>
<LINE>King Capaneus was your lord. The day</LINE>
<LINE>That he should marry you, at such a season</LINE>
<LINE>As now it is with me, I met your groom</LINE>
<LINE>By Mars&#8217;s altar. You were that time fair;</LINE>
<LINE>Not Juno&#8217;s mantle fairer than your tresses,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor in more bounty spread her. Your wheaten wreath</LINE>
<LINE>Was then nor thresh&#8217;d nor blasted; Fortune at you</LINE>
<LINE>Dimpled her cheek with smiles. Hercules our kinsman</LINE>
<LINE>(Then weaker than your eyes) laid by his club;</LINE>
<LINE>He tumbled down upon his Nemean hide,</LINE>
<LINE>And swore his sinews thaw&#8217;d. O grief and time,</LINE>
<LINE>Fearful consumers, you will all devour!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, I hope some god,</LINE>
<LINE>Some god hath put his mercy in your manhood,</LINE>
<LINE>Whereto he&#8217;ll infuse pow&#8217;r, and press you forth</LINE>
<LINE>Our undertaker.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="3">O, no knees, none, widow!</LINE>
<LINE>Unto the helmeted Bellona use them,</LINE>
<LINE>And pray for me your soldier.</LINE>
<LINE>Troubled I am.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Turns away.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Honored Hippolyta,</LINE>
<LINE>Most dreaded Amazonian, that hast slain</LINE>
<LINE>The scythe-tusk&#8217;d boar; that with thy arm, as strong</LINE>
<LINE>As it is white, wast near to make the male</LINE>
<LINE>To thy sex captive, but that this thy lord,</LINE>
<LINE>Born to uphold creation in that honor</LINE>
<LINE>First Nature styl&#8217;d it in, shrunk thee into</LINE>
<LINE>The bound thou wast o&#8217;erflowing, at once subduing</LINE>
<LINE>Thy force and thy affection; soldieress</LINE>
<LINE>That equally canst poise sternness with pity,</LINE>
<LINE>Whom now I know hast much more power on him</LINE>
<LINE>Than ever he had on thee, who ow&#8217;st his strength,</LINE>
<LINE>And his love too, who is a servant for</LINE>
<LINE>The tenor of thy speech; dear glass of ladies,</LINE>
<LINE>Bid him that we, whom flaming war doth scorch,</LINE>
<LINE>Under the shadow of his sword may cool us;</LINE>
<LINE>Require him he advance it o&#8217;er our heads;</LINE>
<LINE>Speak&#8217;t in a woman&#8217;s key&#8212;like such a woman</LINE>
<LINE>As any of us three; weep ere you fail;</LINE>
<LINE>Lend us a knee;</LINE>
<LINE>But touch the ground for us no longer time</LINE>
<LINE>Than a dove&#8217;s motion when the head&#8217;s pluck&#8217;d off;</LINE>
<LINE>Tell him, if he i&#8217; th&#8217; blood-siz&#8217;d field lay swoll&#8217;n,</LINE>
<LINE>Showing the sun his teeth, grinning at the moon,</LINE>
<LINE>What you would do.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HIP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Poor lady, say no more:</LINE>
<LINE>I had as lief trace this good action with you</LINE>
<LINE>As that whereto I am going, and never yet</LINE>
<LINE>Went I so willing way. My lord is taken</LINE>
<LINE>Heart-deep with your distress. Let him consider.</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll speak anon.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>3. QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="3">O, my petition was</LINE>


<STAGEDIR>Kneel to Emilia.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Set down in ice, which by hot grief uncandied</LINE>
<LINE>Melts into drops; so sorrow wanting form</LINE>
<LINE>Is press&#8217;d with deeper matter.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EMIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">Pray stand up,</LINE>
<LINE>Your grief is written in your cheek.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>3. QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">O, woe,</LINE>
<LINE>You cannot read it there. There, through my tears,</LINE>
<LINE>Like wrinkled pebbles in a glassy stream,</LINE>
<LINE>You may behold &#8217;em. Lady, lady, alack!</LINE>
<LINE>He that will all the treasure know o&#8217; th&#8217; earth</LINE>
<LINE>Must know the centre too; he that will fish</LINE>
<LINE>For my least minnow, let him lead his line</LINE>
<LINE>To catch one at my heart. O, pardon me,</LINE>
<LINE>Extremity, that sharpens sundry wits,</LINE>
<LINE>Makes me a fool.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EMIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Pray you say nothing, pray you.</LINE>
<LINE>Who cannot feel nor see the rain, being in&#8217;t,</LINE>
<LINE>Knows neither wet nor dry. If that you were</LINE>
<LINE>The ground-piece of some painter, I would buy you</LINE>
<LINE>T&#8217; instruct me &#8217;gainst a capital grief indeed&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Such heart-pierc&#8217;d demonstration! But alas,</LINE>
<LINE>Being a natural sister of our sex,</LINE>
<LINE>Your sorrow beats so ardently upon me</LINE>
<LINE>That it shall make a counter-reflect &#8217;gainst</LINE>
<LINE>My brother&#8217;s heart, and warm it to some pity,</LINE>
<LINE>Though it were made of stone. Pray have good comfort.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Forward to th&#8217; temple. Leave not out a jot</LINE>
<LINE>O&#8217; th&#8217; sacred ceremony.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">O, this celebration</LINE>
<LINE>Will long last and be more costly than</LINE>
<LINE>Your suppliants&#8217; war! Remember that your fame</LINE>
<LINE>Knolls in the ear o&#8217; th&#8217; world; what you do quickly</LINE>
<LINE>Is not done rashly; your first thought is more</LINE>
<LINE>Than others&#8217; labored meditance; your premeditating</LINE>
<LINE>More than their actions. But, O Jove, your actions,</LINE>
<LINE>Soon as they move, as asprays do the fish,</LINE>
<LINE>Subdue before they touch. Think, dear Duke, think</LINE>
<LINE>What beds our slain kings have!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">What griefs our beds</LINE>
<LINE>That our dear lords have none!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>3. QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">None fit for th&#8217; dead:</LINE>
<LINE>Those that with cords, knives, drams, precipitance,</LINE>
<LINE>Weary of this world&#8217;s light, have to themselves</LINE>
<LINE>Been death&#8217;s most horrid agents, humane grace</LINE>
<LINE>Affords them dust and shadow.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">But our lords</LINE>
<LINE>Lie blist&#8217;ring &#8217;fore the visitating sun,</LINE>
<LINE>And were good kings when living.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is true; and I will give you comfort</LINE>
<LINE>To give your dead lords graves; the which to do</LINE>
<LINE>Must make some work with Creon.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And that work presents itself to th&#8217; doing:</LINE>
<LINE>Now &#8217;twill take form, the heats are gone tomorrow.</LINE>
<LINE>Then, bootless toil must recompense itself</LINE>
<LINE>With its own sweat; now he&#8217;s secure,</LINE>
<LINE>Not dreams we stand before your puissance</LINE>
<LINE>Wrinching our holy begging in our eyes</LINE>
<LINE>To make petition clear.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Now you may take him</LINE>
<LINE>Drunk with his victory.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE offset="5">And his army full</LINE>
<LINE>Of bread and sloth.</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Dowagers, take hands,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We come unseasonably; but when could grief</LINE>
<LINE>Cull forth, as unpang&#8217;d judgment can, fitt&#8217;st time</LINE>
<LINE>For best solicitation?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Why, good ladies,</LINE>
<LINE>This is a service, whereto I am going,</LINE>
<LINE>Greater than any war; it more imports me</LINE>
<LINE>Than all the actions that I have foregone,</LINE>
<LINE>Or futurely can cope.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">The more proclaiming</LINE>

<LINE>Her twinning cherries shall their sweetness fall</LINE>
<LINE>Upon thy tasteful lips, what wilt thou think</LINE>
<LINE>Of rotten kings or blubber&#8217;d queens? What care</LINE>
<LINE>For what thou feel&#8217;st not? What thou feel&#8217;st being able</LINE>
<LINE>To make Mars spurn his drum. O, if thou couch</LINE>
<LINE>But one night with her, every hour in&#8217;t will</LINE>
<LINE>Take hostage of thee for a hundred, and</LINE>
<LINE>Thou shalt remember nothing more than what</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HIP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Though much unlike</LINE>
<LINE>You should be so transported, as much sorry</LINE>
<LINE>I should be such a suitor; yet I think</LINE>
<LINE>Did I not by th&#8217; abstaining of my joy,</LINE>
<LINE>Which breeds a deeper longing, cure their surfeit</LINE>
<LINE>That craves a present med&#8217;cine, I should pluck</LINE>

<LINE>Dear Palamon, dearer in love than blood,</LINE>
<LINE>And our prime cousin, yet unhard&#8217;ned in</LINE>
<LINE>The crimes of nature&#8212;let us leave the city</LINE>
<LINE>Thebes, and the temptings in&#8217;t, before we further</LINE>
<LINE>Sully our gloss of youth:</LINE>
<LINE>And here to keep in abstinence we shame</LINE>
<LINE>As in incontinence; for not to swim</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217; th&#8217; aid o&#8217; th&#8217; current were almost to sink,</LINE>
<LINE>At least to frustrate striving, and to follow</LINE>
<LINE>The common stream, &#8217;twould bring us to an eddy</LINE>
<LINE>Where we should turn or drown; if labor through,</LINE>
<LINE>Our gain but life and weakness.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">Your advice</LINE>
<LINE>Is cried up with example. What strange ruins,</LINE>
<LINE>Since first we went to school, may we perceive</LINE>
<LINE>Walking in Thebes! Scars and bare weeds</LINE>
<LINE>The gain o&#8217; th&#8217; martialist, who did propound</LINE>
<LINE>To his bold ends honor and golden ingots,</LINE>
<LINE>Which though he won, he had not; and now flurted</LINE>
<LINE>By peace, for whom he fought, who then shall offer</LINE>
<LINE>To Mars&#8217;s so scorn&#8217;d altar? I do bleed</LINE>
<LINE>When such I meet, and wish great Juno would</LINE>
<LINE>Resume her ancient fit of jealousy</LINE>
<LINE>To get the soldier work, that peace might purge</LINE>
<LINE>For her repletion, and retain anew</LINE>
<LINE>Her charitable heart, now hard, and harsher</LINE>
<LINE>Than strife or war could be.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">Are you not out?</LINE>
<LINE>Meet you no ruin but the soldier in</LINE>
<LINE>The cranks and turns of Thebes? You did begin</LINE>
<LINE>As if you met decays of many kinds.</LINE>
<LINE>Perceive you none that do arouse your pity</LINE>
<LINE>But th&#8217; unconsider&#8217;d soldier?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">Yes, I pity</LINE>
<LINE>Decays where e&#8217;er I find them, but such most</LINE>
<LINE>That sweating in an honorable toil</LINE>
<LINE>Are paid with ice to cool &#8217;em.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">&#8217;Tis not this</LINE>
<LINE>I did begin to speak of. This is virtue</LINE>
<LINE>Of no respect in Thebes. I spake of Thebes,</LINE>
<LINE>How dangerous, if we will keep our honors,</LINE>
<LINE>It is for our residing; where every evil</LINE>
<LINE>Hath a good color; where ev&#8217;ry seeming good&#8217;s</LINE>
<LINE>A certain evil; where not to be ev&#8217;n jump</LINE>
<LINE>As they are, here were to be strangers, and</LINE>
<LINE>Such things to be, mere monsters.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>PAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">&#8217;Tis in our power</LINE>
<LINE>(Unless we fear that apes can tutor&#8217;s) to</LINE>

<LINE>Affect another&#8217;s gait, which is not catching</LINE>
<LINE>Where there is faith? Or to be fond upon</LINE>
<LINE>Another&#8217;s way of speech, when by mine own</LINE>
<LINE>I may be reasonably conceiv&#8217;d; sav&#8217;d too,</LINE>
<LINE>Speaking it truly? Why am I bound</LINE>
<LINE>By any generous bond to follow him</LINE>
<LINE>Follows his tailor, haply so long until</LINE>
<LINE>The follow&#8217;d make pursuit? Or let me know</LINE>
<LINE>Why mine own barber is unblest, with him</LINE>
<LINE>My poor chin too, for &#8217;tis not scissor&#8217;d just</LINE>
<LINE>To such a favorite&#8217;s glass? What canon is there</LINE>
<LINE>That does command my rapier from my hip,</LINE>
<LINE>To dangle&#8217;t in my hand, or to go tiptoe</LINE>
<LINE>Before the street be foul? Either I am</LINE>
<LINE>The forehorse in the team, or I am none</LINE>
<LINE>That draw i&#8217; th&#8217; sequent trace. These poor slight sores</LINE>
<LINE>Need not a plantin; that which rips my bosom</LINE>

<LINE>A most unbounded tyrant, whose successes</LINE>
<LINE>Makes heaven unfear&#8217;d, and villainy assured</LINE>
<LINE>Beyond its power there&#8217;s nothing; almost puts</LINE>
<LINE>Faith in a fever, and deifies alone</LINE>
<LINE>Voluble chance; who only attributes</LINE>
<LINE>The faculties of other instruments</LINE>
<LINE>To his own nerves and act; commands men service,</LINE>
<LINE>And what they win in&#8217;t, boot and glory; one</LINE>
<LINE>That fears not to do harm; good, dares not. Let</LINE>
<LINE>The blood of mine that&#8217;s sib to him be suck&#8217;d</LINE>

<LINE offset="5">Nothing truer.</LINE>

<LINE>Theseus (who where he threats appalls) hath sent</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<LINE offset="5">Let him approach.</LINE>

<LINE>When that his action&#8217;s dregg&#8217;d with mind assur&#8217;d</LINE>

<LINE offset="5">How his longing</LINE>

<LINE>His careless execution, where nor gain</LINE>
<LINE>Made him regard, or loss consider, but</LINE>
<LINE>Playing o&#8217;er business in his hand, another</LINE>

<LINE>Since our great lord departed?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HIP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">With much labor;</LINE>
<LINE>And I did love him for&#8217;t. They two have cabin&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>In many as dangerous as poor a corner,</LINE>
<LINE>Peril and want contending, they have skiff&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>Torrents whose roaring tyranny and power</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217; th&#8217; least of these was dreadful, and they have</LINE>
<LINE>Fought out together where death&#8217;s self was lodg&#8217;d;</LINE>
<LINE>Yet fate hath brought them off. Their knot of love</LINE>
<LINE>Tied, weav&#8217;d, entangled, with so true, so long,</LINE>
<LINE>And with a finger of so deep a cunning,</LINE>
<LINE>May be outworn, never undone. I think</LINE>
<LINE>Theseus cannot be umpire to himself,</LINE>
<LINE>Cleaving his conscience into twain and doing</LINE>
<LINE>Each side like justice, which he loves best.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EMIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="9">Doubtless</LINE>
<LINE>There is a best, and reason has no manners</LINE>

<LINE>You were at wars when she the grave enrich&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Who made too proud the bed, took leave o&#8217; th&#8217; moon</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EMIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">Yes.</LINE>
<LINE>You talk of Pirithous&#8217; and Theseus&#8217; love:</LINE>
<LINE>Theirs has more ground, is more maturely season&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>More buckled with strong judgment, and their needs</LINE>
<LINE>The one of th&#8217; other may be said to water</LINE>
<LINE>Their intertangled roots of love, but I</LINE>
<LINE>And she (I sigh and spoke of) were things innocent,</LINE>
<LINE>Lov&#8217;d for we did, and like the elements</LINE>
<LINE>That know not what nor why, yet do effect</LINE>
<LINE>Rare issues by their operance, our souls</LINE>
<LINE>Did so to one another. What she lik&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>Was then of me approv&#8217;d, what not, condemn&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>No more arraignment. The flow&#8217;r that I would pluck</LINE>
<LINE>And put between my breasts (O then but beginning</LINE>
<LINE>To swell about the blossom), she would long</LINE>
<LINE>Till she had such another, and commit it</LINE>
<LINE>To the like innocent cradle, where phoenix-like</LINE>
<LINE>They died in perfume. On my head no toy</LINE>
<LINE>But was her pattern, her affections (pretty,</LINE>
<LINE>Though happily her careless wear) I followed</LINE>
<LINE>For my most serious decking. Had mine ear</LINE>
<LINE>Stol&#8217;n some new air, or at adventure humm&#8217;d one</LINE>
<LINE>From musical coinage, why, it was a note</LINE>
<LINE>Whereon her spirits would sojourn (rather dwell on)</LINE>
<LINE>And sing it in her slumbers. This rehearsal</LINE>
<LINE>(Which, ev&#8217;ry innocent wots well, comes in</LINE>
<LINE>Like old importment&#8217;s bastard) has this end,</LINE>
<LINE>That the true love &#8217;tween maid and maid may be</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Jailer and Wooer.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I may depart with little, while I live; something I may cast to you, not much. Alas, the prison I keep, though it be for great ones, yet they seldom come: before one salmon, you shall take a number of minnows. I am given out to be better lin&#8217;d than it can appear to me report is a true speaker. I would I were really that I am deliver&#8217;d to be. Marry, what I have (be it what it will) I will assure upon my daughter at the day of my death.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WOOER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, I demand no more than your own offer, and I will estate your daughter in what I have promis&#8217;d.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, we will talk more of this when the solemnity is past. But have you a full promise of her? When that shall be seen, I tender my consent.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Daughter with strewings.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WOOER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have, sir. Here she comes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your friend and I have chanc&#8217;d to name you here, upon the old business. But no more of that now; so soon as the court hurry is over, we will have an end of it. I&#8217; th&#8217; mean time, look tenderly to the two prisoners. I can tell you they are princes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DAUGH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>These strewings are for their chamber. &#8217;Tis pity they are in prison, and &#8217;twere pity they should be out. I do think they have patience to make any adversity asham&#8217;d. The prison itself is proud of &#8217;em; and they have all the world in their chamber.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>They are fam&#8217;d to be a pair of absolute men.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DAUGH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By my troth, I think fame but stammers &#8217;em, they stand a grise above the reach of report.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I heard them reported in the battle to be the only doers.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DAUGH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, most likely, for they are noble suff&#8217;rers. I marvel how they would have look&#8217;d had they been victors, that with such a constant nobility enforce a freedom out of bondage, making misery their mirth, and affliction a toy to jest at.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do they so?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DAUGH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It seems to me they have no more sense of their captivity than I of ruling Athens. They eat well, look merrily, discourse of many things, but nothing of their own restraint and disasters. Yet sometime a divided sigh, martyr&#8217;d as &#8217;twere i&#8217; th&#8217; deliverance, will break from one of them; when the other presently gives it so sweet a rebuke that I could wish myself a sigh to be so chid, or at least a sigher to be comforted.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WOOER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I never saw &#8217;em.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The Duke himself came privately in the night, and so did they. What the reason of it is, I know not.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter Palamon and Arcite above.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Look yonder they are! That&#8217;s Arcite looks out.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DAUGH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, sir, no, that&#8217;s Palamon. Arcite is the lower of the twain; you may perceive a part of him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go to, leave your pointing. They would not make us their object. Out of their sight.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DAUGH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is a holiday to look on them. Lord, the diff&#8217;rence of men!</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How do you, noble cousin?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">How do you, sir?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, strong enough to laugh at misery</LINE>
<LINE>And bear the chance of war yet. We are prisoners</LINE>
<LINE>I fear forever, cousin.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">I believe it,</LINE>
<LINE>And to that destiny have patiently</LINE>
<LINE>Laid up my hour to come.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">O cousin Arcite,</LINE>
<LINE>Where is Thebes now? Where is our noble country?</LINE>
<LINE>Where are our friends and kindreds? Never more</LINE>
<LINE>Must we behold those comforts, never see</LINE>
<LINE>The hardy youths strive for the games of honor,</LINE>
<LINE>Hung with the painted favors of their ladies,</LINE>
<LINE>Like tall ships under sail; then start amongst &#8217;em</LINE>
<LINE>And as an east wind leave &#8217;em all behind us,</LINE>
<LINE>Like lazy clouds, whilst Palamon and Arcite,</LINE>
<LINE>Even in the wagging of a wanton leg,</LINE>
<LINE>Outstripp&#8217;d the people&#8217;s praises, won the garlands,</LINE>
<LINE>Ere they have time to wish &#8217;em ours. O, never</LINE>
<LINE>Shall we two exercise, like twins of honor,</LINE>
<LINE>Our arms again, and feel our fiery horses</LINE>
<LINE>Like proud seas under us. Our good swords now</LINE>
<LINE>(Better the red-ey&#8217;d god of war nev&#8217;r ware),</LINE>
<LINE>Ravish&#8217;d our sides, like age must run to rust,</LINE>
<LINE>And deck the temples of those gods that hate us;</LINE>
<LINE>These hands shall never draw &#8217;em out like lightning</LINE>
<LINE>To blast whole armies more.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">No, Palamon,</LINE>
<LINE>Those hopes are prisoners with us. Here we are,</LINE>
<LINE>And here the graces of our youths must wither</LINE>
<LINE>Like a too-timely spring. Here age must find us,</LINE>
<LINE>And which is heaviest, Palamon, unmarried.</LINE>
<LINE>The sweet embraces of a loving wife,</LINE>
<LINE>Loaden with kisses, arm&#8217;d with thousand Cupids,</LINE>
<LINE>Shall never clasp our necks; no issue know us;</LINE>
<LINE>No figures of ourselves shall we ev&#8217;r see</LINE>
<LINE>To glad our age, and like young eagles teach &#8217;em</LINE>
<LINE>Boldly to gaze against bright arms, and say,</LINE>
<LINE>&#8220;Remember what your fathers were, and conquer!&#8221;</LINE>
<LINE>The fair-ey&#8217;d maids shall weep our banishments,</LINE>
<LINE>And in their songs curse ever-blinded Fortune</LINE>
<LINE>Till she for shame see what a wrong she has done</LINE>
<LINE>To youth and nature. This is all our world:</LINE>
<LINE>We shall know nothing here but one another,</LINE>
<LINE>Hear nothing but the clock that tells our woes;</LINE>
<LINE>The vine shall grow, but we shall never see it;</LINE>
<LINE>Summer shall come, and with her all delights,</LINE>
<LINE>But dead-cold winter must inhabit here still.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis too true, Arcite. To our Theban hounds,</LINE>
<LINE>That shook the aged forest with their echoes,</LINE>
<LINE>No more now must we hallow; no more shake</LINE>
<LINE>Our pointed javelins, whilst the angry swine</LINE>
<LINE>Flies like a Parthian quiver from our rages,</LINE>
<LINE>Struck with our well-steel&#8217;d darts. All valiant uses</LINE>
<LINE>(The food and nourishment of noble minds)</LINE>
<LINE>In us two here shall perish; we shall die</LINE>
<LINE>(Which is the curse of honor) lastly</LINE>
<LINE>Children of grief and ignorance.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">Yet, cousin,</LINE>
<LINE>Even from the bottom of these miseries,</LINE>
<LINE>From all that fortune can inflict upon us,</LINE>
<LINE>I see two comforts rising, two mere blessings,</LINE>
<LINE>If the gods please&#8212;to hold here a brave patience,</LINE>
<LINE>And the enjoying of our griefs together.</LINE>
<LINE>Whilst Palamon is with me, let me perish</LINE>
<LINE>If I think this our prison.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Certainly</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis a main goodness, cousin, that our fortunes</LINE>
<LINE>Were twin&#8217;d together. &#8217;Tis most true, two souls</LINE>
<LINE>Put in two noble bodies, let &#8217;em suffer</LINE>
<LINE>The gall of hazard, so they grow together,</LINE>
<LINE>Will never sink; they must not, say they could;</LINE>
<LINE>A willing man dies sleeping, and all&#8217;s done.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Shall we make worthy uses of this place</LINE>
<LINE>That all men hate so much?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">How, gentle cousin?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let&#8217;s think this prison holy sanctuary</LINE>
<LINE>To keep us from corruption of worse men.</LINE>
<LINE>We are young and yet desire the ways of honor,</LINE>
<LINE>That liberty and common conversation,</LINE>
<LINE>The poison of pure spirits, might, like women,</LINE>
<LINE>Woo us to wander from. What worthy blessing</LINE>
<LINE>Can be, but our imaginations</LINE>
<LINE>May make it ours? And here being thus together,</LINE>
<LINE>We are an endless mine to one another;</LINE>
<LINE>We are one another&#8217;s wife, ever begetting</LINE>
<LINE>New births of love; we are father, friends, acquaintance;</LINE>
<LINE>We are, in one another, families:</LINE>
<LINE>I am your heir, and you are mine; this place</LINE>
<LINE>Is our inheritance. No hard oppressor</LINE>
<LINE>Dare take this from us; here with a little patience</LINE>
<LINE>We shall live long, and loving. No surfeits seek us;</LINE>
<LINE>The hand of war hurts none here, nor the seas</LINE>
<LINE>Swallow their youth. Were we at liberty,</LINE>
<LINE>A wife might part us lawfully, or business,</LINE>
<LINE>Quarrels consume us, envy of ill men</LINE>
<LINE>Crave our acquaintance; I might sicken, cousin,</LINE>
<LINE>Where you should never know it, and so perish</LINE>
<LINE>Without your noble hand to close mine eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>Or prayers to the gods. A thousand chances,</LINE>
<LINE>Were we from hence, would sever us.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="8">You have made me</LINE>
<LINE>(I thank you, cousin Arcite) almost wanton</LINE>
<LINE>With my captivity. What a misery</LINE>
<LINE>It is to live abroad, and every where!</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis like a beast, methinks. I find the court here,</LINE>
<LINE>I am sure, a more content, and all those pleasures</LINE>
<LINE>That woo the wills of men to vanity</LINE>
<LINE>I see through now, and am sufficient</LINE>
<LINE>To tell the world &#8217;tis but a gaudy shadow</LINE>
<LINE>That old Time, as he passes by, takes with him.</LINE>
<LINE>What had we been, old in the court of Creon,</LINE>
<LINE>Where sin is justice, lust and ignorance</LINE>
<LINE>The virtues of the great ones? Cousin Arcite,</LINE>
<LINE>Had not the loving gods found this place for us,</LINE>
<LINE>We had died as they do, ill old men, unwept,</LINE>
<LINE>And had their epitaphs, the people&#8217;s curses.</LINE>
<LINE>Shall I say more?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE offset="5">Sure there cannot.</LINE>

<LINE>I&#8217;ll have a gown full of &#8217;em, and of these:</LINE>

<LINE>Rarely upon a skirt, wench?</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WOMAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Why, gentle madam?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EMIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is the very emblem of a maid;</LINE>
<LINE>For when the west wind courts her gently,</LINE>
<LINE>How modestly she blows, and paints the sun</LINE>
<LINE>With her chaste blushes! When the north comes near her,</LINE>
<LINE>Rude and impatient, then, like chastity,</LINE>
<LINE>She locks her beauties in her bud again,</LINE>
<LINE>And leaves him to base briers.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WOMAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">Yet, good madam,</LINE>
<LINE>Sometimes her modesty will blow so far she falls for&#8217;t.</LINE>
<LINE>A maid, if she have any honor, would be loath</LINE>
<LINE>To take example by her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>I am wondrous merry-hearted, I could laugh now.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I saw her too.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="3">Yes, but you must not love her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will not, as you do&#8212;to worship her</LINE>
<LINE>As she is heavenly and a blessed goddess;</LINE>
<LINE>I love her as a woman, to enjoy her.</LINE>
<LINE>So both may love.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAL.</SPEAKER>

<SPEAKER>PAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I, that first saw her; I, that took possession</LINE>
<LINE>First with mine eye of all those beauties in her</LINE>
<LINE>Reveal&#8217;d to mankind. If thou lov&#8217;st her,</LINE>
<LINE>Or entertain&#8217;st a hope to blast my wishes,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou art a traitor, Arcite, and a fellow</LINE>
<LINE>False as thy title to her. Friendship, blood,</LINE>
<LINE>And all the ties between us, I disclaim</LINE>
<LINE>If thou once think upon her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">Yes, I love her,</LINE>
<LINE>And if the lives of all my name lay on it,</LINE>
<LINE>I must do so; I love her with my soul;</LINE>
<LINE>If that will lose ye, farewell, Palamon.</LINE>
<LINE>I say again, I love, and in loving her maintain</LINE>
<LINE>I am as worthy and as free a lover,</LINE>
<LINE>And have as just a title to her beauty,</LINE>
<LINE>As any Palamon or any living</LINE>
<LINE>That is a man&#8217;s son.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Have I call&#8217;d thee friend?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, and have found me so. Why are you mov&#8217;d thus?</LINE>
<LINE>Let me deal coldly with you: am not I</LINE>
<LINE>Part of your blood, part of your soul? You have told me</LINE>
<LINE>That I was Palamon, and you were Arcite.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="9">Yes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Am not I liable to those affections,</LINE>
<LINE>Those joys, griefs, angers, fears, my friend shall suffer?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ye may be.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="3">Why then would you deal so cunningly,</LINE>
<LINE>So strangely, so unlike a noble kinsman,</LINE>
<LINE>To love alone? Speak truly: do you think me</LINE>
<LINE>Unworthy of her sight?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">No; but unjust</LINE>
<LINE>If thou pursue that sight.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Because another</LINE>
<LINE>First sees the enemy, shall I stand still,</LINE>
<LINE>And let mine honor down, and never charge?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, if he be but one.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">But say that one</LINE>
<LINE>Had rather combat me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Let that one say so,</LINE>
<LINE>And use thy freedom; else, if thou pursuest her,</LINE>
<LINE>Be as that cursed man that hates his country,</LINE>
<LINE>A branded villain.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">You are mad.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">I must be&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Till thou art worthy, Arcite, it concerns me,</LINE>
<LINE>And in this madness if I hazard thee</LINE>
<LINE>And take thy life, I deal but truly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">Fie, sir!</LINE>
<LINE>You play the child extremely. I will love her,</LINE>
<LINE>I must, I ought to do so, and I dare&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>And all this justly.</LINE>

<LINE>Why should I love this gentleman? &#8217;Tis odds</LINE>

<LINE>My father the mean keeper of his prison,</LINE>
<LINE>And he a prince. To marry him is hopeless;</LINE>
<LINE>To be his whore is witless. Out upon&#8217;t!</LINE>
<LINE>What pushes are we wenches driven to</LINE>
<LINE>When fifteen once has found us! First, I saw him:</LINE>
<LINE>I, seeing, thought he was a goodly man;</LINE>
<LINE>He has as much to please a woman in him</LINE>
<LINE>(If he please to bestow it so) as ever</LINE>
<LINE>These eyes yet look&#8217;d on. Next, I pitied him;</LINE>
<LINE>And so would any young wench o&#8217; my conscience</LINE>
<LINE>That ever dream&#8217;d, or vow&#8217;d her maidenhead</LINE>
<LINE>To a young handsome man. Then, I lov&#8217;d him,</LINE>
<LINE>Extremely lov&#8217;d him, infinitely lov&#8217;d him;</LINE>
<LINE>And yet he had a cousin, fair as he too;</LINE>
<LINE>But in my heart was Palamon, and there,</LINE>
<LINE>Lord, what a coil he keeps! To hear him</LINE>
<LINE>Sing in an evening, what a heaven it is!</LINE>
<LINE>And yet his songs are sad ones. Fairer spoken</LINE>
<LINE>Was never gentleman. When I come in</LINE>
<LINE>To bring him water in a morning, first</LINE>
<LINE>He bows his noble body, then salutes me thus:</LINE>
<LINE>&#8220;Fair gentle maid, good morrow. May thy goodness</LINE>
<LINE>Get thee a happy husband!&#8221; Once he kiss&#8217;d me&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>I lov&#8217;d my lips the better ten days after.</LINE>
<LINE>Would he would do so ev&#8217;ry day! He grieves much,</LINE>
<LINE>And me as much to see his misery.</LINE>
<LINE>What should I do to make him know I love him,</LINE>
<LINE>For I would fain enjoy him? Say I ventur&#8217;d</LINE>

<LINE>Let all the dukes and all the devils roar,</LINE>
<LINE>He is at liberty! I have ventur&#8217;d for him,</LINE>
<LINE>And out I have brought him to a little wood</LINE>
<LINE>A mile hence. I have sent him where a cedar,</LINE>
<LINE>Higher than all the rest, spreads like a plane</LINE>
<LINE>Fast by a brook, and there he shall keep close</LINE>
<LINE>Till I provide him files and food, for yet</LINE>
<LINE>His iron bracelets are not off. O Love,</LINE>
<LINE>What a stout-hearted child thou art! My father</LINE>
<LINE>Durst better have endur&#8217;d cold iron than done it.</LINE>
<LINE>I love him beyond love and beyond reason,</LINE>
<LINE>Or wit, or safety. I have made him know it.</LINE>
<LINE>I care not, I am desperate. If the law</LINE>
<LINE>Find me, and then condemn me for&#8217;t, some wenches,</LINE>
<LINE>Some honest-hearted maids, will sing my dirge,</LINE>
<LINE>And tell to memory my death was noble,</LINE>
<LINE>Dying almost a martyr. That way he takes</LINE>
<LINE>I purpose is my way too. Sure he cannot</LINE>
<LINE>Be so unmanly as to leave me here.</LINE>
<LINE>If he do, maids will not so easily</LINE>
<LINE>Trust men again. And yet he has not thank&#8217;d me</LINE>
<LINE>For what I have done; no, not so much as kiss&#8217;d me;</LINE>
<LINE>And that, methinks, is not so well; nor scarcely</LINE>
<LINE>Could I persuade him to become a freeman,</LINE>
<LINE>He made such scruples of the wrong he did</LINE>
<LINE>To me and to my father. Yet I hope,</LINE>
<LINE>When he considers more, this love of mine</LINE>
<LINE>Will take more root within him. Let him do</LINE>
<LINE>What he will with me, so he use me kindly,</LINE>
<LINE>For use me so he shall, or I&#8217;ll proclaim him,</LINE>
<LINE>And to his face, no man. I&#8217;ll presently</LINE>
<LINE>Provide him necessaries, and pack my clothes up,</LINE>
<LINE>And where there is a path of ground I&#8217;ll venture,</LINE>
<LINE>So he be with me. By him, like a shadow,</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll ever dwell. Within this hour the whoobub</LINE>
<LINE>Will be all o&#8217;er the prison. I am then</LINE>
<LINE>Kissing the man they look for. Farewell, father;</LINE>

<LINE>The Duke has lost Hippolyta; each took</LINE>
<LINE>A several land. This is a solemn rite</LINE>
<LINE>They owe bloom&#8217;d May, and the Athenians pay it</LINE>
<LINE>To th&#8217; heart of ceremony. O queen Emilia,</LINE>
<LINE>Fresher than May, sweeter</LINE>
<LINE>Than her gold buttons on the boughs, or all</LINE>
<LINE>Th&#8217; enamell&#8217;d knacks o&#8217; th&#8217; mead or garden! Yea</LINE>
<LINE>(We challenge too) the bank of any nymph,</LINE>
<LINE>That makes the stream seem flowers! Thou, O jewel</LINE>
<LINE>O&#8217; th&#8217; wood, o&#8217; th&#8217; world, hast likewise blest a place</LINE>
<LINE>With thy sole presence. In thy rumination</LINE>
<LINE>That I, poor man, might eftsoons come between</LINE>
<LINE>And chop on some cold thought! Thrice-blessed chance,</LINE>
<LINE>To drop on such a mistress, expectation</LINE>
<LINE>Most guiltless on&#8217;t. Tell me, O Lady Fortune</LINE>
<LINE>(Next after Emily my sovereign), how far</LINE>
<LINE>I may be proud. She takes strong note of me,</LINE>
<LINE>Hath made me near her; and this beauteous morn</LINE>
<LINE>(The prim&#8217;st of all the year) presents me with</LINE>
<LINE>A brace of horses; two such steeds might well</LINE>
<LINE>Be by a pair of kings back&#8217;d, in a field</LINE>
<LINE>That their crowns&#8217; titles tried. Alas, alas,</LINE>
<LINE>Poor cousin Palamon, poor prisoner, thou</LINE>
<LINE>So little dream&#8217;st upon my fortune that</LINE>
<LINE>Thou think&#8217;st thyself the happier thing to be</LINE>
<LINE>So near Emilia. Me thou deem&#8217;st at Thebes,</LINE>
<LINE>And therein wretched, although free. But if</LINE>
<LINE>Thou knew&#8217;st my mistress breath&#8217;d on me, and that</LINE>
<LINE>I ear&#8217;d her language, liv&#8217;d in her eye, O coz,</LINE>

<LINE>That ev&#8217;r bore gentle token! Falsest cousin</LINE>
<LINE>That ever blood made kin, call&#8217;st thou her thine?</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll prove it in my shackles, with these hands</LINE>
<LINE>Void of appointment, that thou li&#8217;st, and art</LINE>
<LINE>A very thief in love, a chaffy lord,</LINE>

<LINE>I care for nothing, and that&#8217;s Palamon.</LINE>
<LINE>I reak not if the wolves would jaw me, so</LINE>

<LINE>I cannot hallow. If I whoop&#8217;d, what then?</LINE>
<LINE>If he not answer&#8217;d, I should call a wolf,</LINE>

<LINE>Strange howls this livelong night; why may&#8217;t not be</LINE>
<LINE>They have made prey of him? He has no weapons,</LINE>

<LINE>He&#8217;s torn to pieces. They howl&#8217;d many together,</LINE>

<LINE>My lost strength to me, I was grown so low</LINE>

<LINE>Thou art yet a fair foe; and I feel myself,</LINE>
<LINE>With this refreshing, able once again</LINE>
<LINE>To out-dure danger. To delay it longer</LINE>
<LINE>Would make the world think, when it comes to hearing,</LINE>
<LINE>That I lay fatting like a swine, to fight,</LINE>
<LINE>And not a soldier: therefore this blest morning</LINE>
<LINE>Shall be the last; and that sword he refuses,</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">That&#8217;s well said.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="8">You&#8217;ll find it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then as I am an honest man, and love</LINE>
<LINE>With all the justice of affection,</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll pay thee soundly. This I&#8217;ll take.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">That&#8217;s mine then.</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll arm you first.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Do. Pray thee tell me, cousin,</LINE>
<LINE>Where got&#8217;st thou this good armor?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">&#8217;Tis the Duke&#8217;s,</LINE>
<LINE>And to say true, I stole it. Do I pinch you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="9">No.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is&#8217;t not too heavy?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">I have worn a lighter,</LINE>
<LINE>But I shall make it serve.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">I&#8217;ll buckle&#8217;t close.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By any means.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="3">You care not for a grand-guard?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, no, we&#8217;ll use no horses. I perceive</LINE>
<LINE>You would fain be at that fight.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">I am indifferent.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Faith, so am I. Good cousin, thrust the buckle</LINE>
<LINE>Through far enough.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">I warrant you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="8">My casque now.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Will you fight bare-arm&#8217;d?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">We shall be the nimbler.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But use your gauntlets though. Those are o&#8217; th&#8217; least;</LINE>
<LINE>Prithee take mine, good cousin.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">Thank you, Arcite.</LINE>
<LINE>How do I look? Am I fall&#8217;n much away?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Faith, very little. Love has us&#8217;d you kindly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll warrant thee, I&#8217;ll strike home.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">Do, and spare not.</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll give you cause, sweet cousin.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">Now to you, sir.</LINE>
<LINE>Methinks this armor&#8217;s very like that, Arcite,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou wor&#8217;st that day the three kings fell, but lighter.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That was a very good one, and that day,</LINE>
<LINE>I well remember, you outdid me, cousin;</LINE>
<LINE>I never saw such valor. When you charg&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>Upon the left wing of the enemy,</LINE>
<LINE>I spurr&#8217;d hard to come up, and under me</LINE>
<LINE>I had a right good horse.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">You had indeed,</LINE>
<LINE>A bright bay, I remember.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Yes, but all</LINE>
<LINE>Was vainly labor&#8217;d in me; you outwent me,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor could my wishes reach you. Yet a little</LINE>
<LINE>I did by imitation.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">More by virtue.</LINE>
<LINE>You are modest, cousin.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">When I saw you charge first,</LINE>
<LINE>Methought I heard a dreadful clap of thunder</LINE>
<LINE>Break from the troop.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">But still before that flew</LINE>
<LINE>The lightning of your valor. Stay a little;</LINE>
<LINE>Is not this piece too strait?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">No, no, &#8217;tis well.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would have nothing hurt thee but my sword,</LINE>
<LINE>A bruise would be dishonor.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">Now I am perfect.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Stand off then.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="3">Take my sword, I hold it better.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I thank ye. No, keep it, your life lies on it.</LINE>
<LINE>Here&#8217;s one, if it but hold, I ask no more</LINE>
<LINE>For all my hopes. My cause and honor guard me!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And me my love!</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>They bow several ways; then advance and stand.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE offset="4">Is there aught else to say?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This only, and no more: thou art mine aunt&#8217;s son,</LINE>
<LINE>And that blood we desire to shed is mutual,</LINE>
<LINE>In me, thine, and in thee, mine. My sword</LINE>
<LINE>Is in my hand, and if thou kill&#8217;st me,</LINE>
<LINE>The gods and I forgive thee. If there be</LINE>
<LINE>A place prepar&#8217;d for those that sleep in honor,</LINE>
<LINE>I wish his weary soul that falls may win it.</LINE>
<LINE>Fight bravely, cousin. Give me thy noble hand.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here, Palamon: this hand shall never more</LINE>
<LINE>Come near thee with such friendship.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="8">I commend thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If I fall, curse me, and say I was a coward,</LINE>
<LINE>For none but such dare die in these just trials.</LINE>
<LINE>Once more farewell, my cousin.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">Farewell, Arcite.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Fight. Horns within; they stand.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Lo, cousin, lo, our folly has undone us.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="2">This is the Duke, a-hunting as I told you.</LINE>
<LINE>If we be found, we are wretched. O, retire</LINE>
<LINE>For honor&#8217;s sake, and safely presently</LINE>
<LINE>Into your bush again, sir. We shall find</LINE>
<LINE>Too many hours to die in, gentle cousin.</LINE>
<LINE>If you be seen, you perish instantly</LINE>
<LINE>For breaking prison, and I, if you reveal me,</LINE>
<LINE>For my contempt. Then all the world will scorn us,</LINE>
<LINE>And say we had a noble difference,</LINE>
<LINE>But base disposers of it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">No, no, cousin,</LINE>
<LINE>I will no more be hidden, nor put off</LINE>
<LINE>This great adventure to a second trial.</LINE>
<LINE>I know your cunning, and I know your cause.</LINE>
<LINE>He that faints now, shame take him! Put thyself</LINE>
<LINE>Upon thy present guard&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">You are not mad?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Or I will make th&#8217; advantage of this hour</LINE>
<LINE>Mine own; and what to come shall threaten me</LINE>
<LINE>I fear less than my fortune. Know, weak cousin,</LINE>
<LINE>I love Emilia, and in that I&#8217;ll bury</LINE>
<LINE>Thee and all crosses else.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Then come what can come,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou shalt know, Palamon, I dare as well</LINE>
<LINE>Die as discourse or sleep. Only this fears me,</LINE>
<LINE>The law will have the honor of our ends.</LINE>
<LINE>Have at thy life!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="3">Look to thine own well, Arcite.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Fight again. Horns.</STAGEDIR>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Theseus, Hippolyta, Emilia, Pirithous, and Train.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What ignorant and mad malicious traitors</LINE>
<LINE>Are you, that &#8217;gainst the tenor of my laws</LINE>
<LINE>Are making battle, thus like knights appointed,</LINE>
<LINE>Without my leave and officers of arms?</LINE>
<LINE>By Castor, both shall die.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Hold thy word, Theseus.</LINE>
<LINE>We are certainly both traitors, both despisers</LINE>
<LINE>Of thee and of thy goodness. I am Palamon,</LINE>
<LINE>That cannot love thee, he that broke thy prison&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Think well what that deserves; and this is Arcite,</LINE>
<LINE>A bolder traitor never trod thy ground,</LINE>
<LINE>A falser nev&#8217;r seem&#8217;d friend. This is the man</LINE>
<LINE>Was begg&#8217;d and banish&#8217;d, this is he contemns thee</LINE>
<LINE>And what thou dar&#8217;st do; and in this disguise,</LINE>
<LINE>Against thy own edict, follows thy sister,</LINE>
<LINE>That fortunate bright star, the fair Emilia,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose servant (if there be a right in seeing,</LINE>
<LINE>And first bequeathing of the soul to) justly</LINE>
<LINE>I am, and which is more, dares think her his.</LINE>
<LINE>This treachery, like a most trusty lover,</LINE>
<LINE>I call&#8217;d him now to answer. If thou be&#8217;st,</LINE>
<LINE>As thou art spoken, great and virtuous,</LINE>
<LINE>The true decider of all injuries,</LINE>
<LINE>Say, &#8220;Fight again!&#8221; and thou shalt see me, Theseus,</LINE>
<LINE>Do such a justice thou thyself wilt envy.</LINE>
<LINE>Then take my life, I&#8217;ll woo thee to&#8217;t.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PIR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">O heaven,</LINE>
<LINE>What more than man is this!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">I have sworn.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="9">We seek not</LINE>
<LINE>Thy breath of mercy, Theseus. &#8217;Tis to me</LINE>
<LINE>A thing as soon to die as thee to say it,</LINE>
<LINE>And no more mov&#8217;d. Where this man calls me traitor,</LINE>
<LINE>Let me say thus much: if in love be treason</LINE>
<LINE>In service of so excellent a beauty,</LINE>
<LINE>As I love most, and in that faith will perish,</LINE>
<LINE>As I have brought my life here to confirm it,</LINE>
<LINE>As I have serv&#8217;d her truest, worthiest,</LINE>
<LINE>As I dare kill this cousin that denies it,</LINE>
<LINE>So let me be most traitor, and ye please me.</LINE>
<LINE>For scorning thy edict, Duke, ask that lady</LINE>
<LINE>Why she is fair, and why her eyes command me</LINE>
<LINE>Stay here to love her; and if she say &#8220;traitor,&#8221;</LINE>
<LINE>I am a villain fit to lie unburied.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou shalt have pity of us both, O Theseus,</LINE>
<LINE>If unto neither thou show mercy. Stop,</LINE>
<LINE>As thou art just, thy noble ear against us;</LINE>
<LINE>As thou art valiant, for thy cousin&#8217;s soul,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose twelve strong labors crown his memory,</LINE>
<LINE>Let &#8217;s die together, at one instant, Duke.</LINE>
<LINE>Only a little let him fall before me,</LINE>
<LINE>That I may tell my soul he shall not have her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I grant your wish, for to say true, your cousin</LINE>
<LINE>Has ten times more offended, for I gave him</LINE>
<LINE>More mercy than you found, sir, your offenses</LINE>
<LINE>Being no more than his. None here speak for &#8217;em,</LINE>
<LINE>For ere the sun set, both shall sleep forever.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HIP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alas, the pity! Now or never, sister,</LINE>
<LINE>Speak, not to be denied. That face of yours</LINE>
<LINE>Will bear the curses else of after-ages</LINE>
<LINE>For these lost cousins.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EMIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">In my face, dear sister,</LINE>
<LINE>I find no anger to &#8217;em, nor no ruin:</LINE>
<LINE>The misadventure of their own eyes kill &#8217;em;</LINE>
<LINE>Yet that I will be woman, and have pity,</LINE>
<LINE>My knees shall grow to th&#8217; ground but I&#8217;ll get mercy.</LINE>
<LINE>Help me, dear sister, in a deed so virtuous</LINE>
<LINE>The powers of all women will be with us.</LINE>
<LINE>Most royal brother&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>They kneel.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HIP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Sir, by our tie of marriage&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EMIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By your own spotless honor&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HIP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">By that faith,</LINE>
<LINE>That fair hand, and that honest heart you gave me&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EMIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By that you would have pity in another,</LINE>
<LINE>By your own virtues infinite&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HIP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">By valor,</LINE>
<LINE>By all the chaste nights I have ever pleas&#8217;d you&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>These are strange conjurings.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PIR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">Nay then I&#8217;ll in too.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Kneels.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>By all our friendship, sir, by all our dangers,</LINE>
<LINE>By all you love most&#8212;wars, and this sweet lady&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EMIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By that you would have trembled to deny</LINE>
<LINE>A blushing maid&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HIP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">By your own eyes, by strength,</LINE>
<LINE>In which you swore I went beyond all women,</LINE>
<LINE>Almost all men, and yet I yielded, Theseus&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PIR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To crown all this, by your most noble soul,</LINE>
<LINE>Which cannot want due mercy, I beg first.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HIP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Next hear my prayers.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EMIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Last let me entreat, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PIR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For mercy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HIP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="3">Mercy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EMIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Mercy on these princes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ye make my faith reel. Say I felt</LINE>
<LINE>Compassion to &#8217;em both, how would you place it?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EMIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Upon their lives; but with their banishments.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You are a right woman, sister, you have pity,</LINE>
<LINE>But want the understanding where to use it.</LINE>
<LINE>If you desire their lives, invent a way</LINE>
<LINE>Safer than banishment. Can these two live,</LINE>
<LINE>And have the agony of love about &#8217;em,</LINE>
<LINE>And not kill one another? Every day</LINE>
<LINE>They&#8217;ld fight about you; hourly bring your honor</LINE>
<LINE>In public question with their swords. Be wise then</LINE>
<LINE>And here forget &#8217;em; it concerns your credit</LINE>
<LINE>And my oath equally. I have said they die;</LINE>
<LINE>Better they fall by th&#8217; law than one another.</LINE>
<LINE>Bow not my honor.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EMIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">O my noble brother,</LINE>
<LINE>That oath was rashly made, and in your anger,</LINE>
<LINE>Your reason will not hold it. If such vows</LINE>
<LINE>Stand for express will, all the world must perish.</LINE>
<LINE>Beside, I have another oath &#8217;gainst yours,</LINE>
<LINE>Of more authority, I am sure more love,</LINE>
<LINE>Not made in passion neither, but good heed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What is it, sister?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PIR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Urge it home, brave lady.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EMIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That you would nev&#8217;r deny me any thing</LINE>
<LINE>Fit for my modest suit and your free granting.</LINE>
<LINE>I tie you to your word now; if ye fall in&#8217;t,</LINE>
<LINE>Think how you maim your honor</LINE>
<LINE>(For now I am set a-begging, sir, I am deaf</LINE>
<LINE>To all but your compassion), how their lives</LINE>
<LINE>Might breed the ruin of my name; opinion,</LINE>
<LINE>Shall any thing that loves me perish for me?</LINE>
<LINE>That were a cruel wisdom. Do men proin</LINE>
<LINE>The straight young boughs that blush with thousand blossoms,</LINE>
<LINE>Because they may be rotten? O Duke Theseus,</LINE>
<LINE>The goodly mothers that have groan&#8217;d for these,</LINE>
<LINE>And all the longing maids that ever lov&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>If your vow stand, shall curse me and my beauty,</LINE>
<LINE>And in their funeral songs for these two cousins</LINE>
<LINE>Despise my cruelty, and cry woe worth me,</LINE>
<LINE>Till I am nothing but the scorn of women.</LINE>
<LINE>For heaven&#8217;s sake save their lives, and banish &#8217;em.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>On what conditions?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EMIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Swear &#8217;em never more</LINE>
<LINE>To make me their contention, or to know me,</LINE>
<LINE>To tread upon thy dukedom, and to be,</LINE>
<LINE>Where ever they shall travel, ever strangers</LINE>
<LINE>To one another.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">I&#8217;ll be cut a-pieces</LINE>
<LINE>Before I take this oath. Forget I love her?</LINE>
<LINE>O all ye gods, despise me then. Thy banishment</LINE>
<LINE>I not mislike, so we may fairly carry</LINE>
<LINE>Our swords and cause along; else, never trifle,</LINE>
<LINE>But take our lives, Duke. I must love, and will,</LINE>
<LINE>And for that love must and dare kill this cousin,</LINE>
<LINE>On any piece the earth has.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Will you, Arcite,</LINE>
<LINE>Take these conditions?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">He&#8217;s a villain then.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PIR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>These are men!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, never. Duke. &#8217;Tis worse to me than begging</LINE>
<LINE>To take my life so basely. Though I think</LINE>
<LINE>I never shall enjoy her, yet I&#8217;ll preserve</LINE>
<LINE>The honor of affection, and die for her,</LINE>
<LINE>Make death a devil.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What may be done? For now I feel compassion.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PIR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let it not fall again, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Say, Emilia,</LINE>
<LINE>If one of them were dead, as one must, are you</LINE>
<LINE>Content to take th&#8217; other to your husband?</LINE>
<LINE>They cannot both enjoy you. They are princes</LINE>
<LINE>As goodly as your own eyes, and as noble</LINE>
<LINE>As ever fame yet spoke of. Look upon &#8217;em</LINE>
<LINE>And if you can love, end this difference.</LINE>
<LINE>I give consent.&#8212;Are you content too, princes?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BOTH. ARC. AND PAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>With all our souls.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">He that she refuses</LINE>
<LINE>Must die then.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>BOTH. ARC. AND PAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="3">Any death thou canst invent, Duke.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If I fall from that mouth, I fall with favor,</LINE>
<LINE>And lovers yet unborn shall bless my ashes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If she refuse me, yet my grave will wed me,</LINE>
<LINE>And soldiers sing my epitaph.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">Make choice then.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EMIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I cannot, sir, they are both too excellent:</LINE>
<LINE>For me, a hair shall never fall of these men.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HIP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What will become of &#8217;em?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Thus I ordain it,</LINE>
<LINE>And by mine honor, once again it stands,</LINE>
<LINE>Or both shall die: you shall both to your country,</LINE>
<LINE>And each within this month, accompanied</LINE>
<LINE>With three fair knights, appear again in this place,</LINE>
<LINE>In which I&#8217;ll plant a pyramid; and whether,</LINE>
<LINE>Before us that are here, can force his cousin</LINE>
<LINE>By fair and knightly strength to touch the pillar,</LINE>
<LINE>He shall enjoy her; the other lose his head,</LINE>
<LINE>And all his friends; nor shall he grudge to fall,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor think he dies with interest in this lady.</LINE>
<LINE>Will this content ye?</LINE>

<LINE>Of those two ladies; and to second them,</LINE>
<LINE>That truly noble prince Pirithous,</LINE>

<SPEAKER>JAIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do not think she was very well, for, now</LINE>
<LINE>You make me mind her, but this very day</LINE>
<LINE>I ask&#8217;d her questions, and she answered me</LINE>
<LINE>So far from what she was, so childishly,</LINE>
<LINE>So sillily, as if she were a fool,</LINE>
<LINE>An innocent, and I was very angry.</LINE>
<LINE>But what of her, sir?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WOOER.</SPEAKER>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">I half suspected</LINE>
<LINE>What you told me. The gods comfort her!</LINE>
<LINE>Either this was her love to Palamon,</LINE>
<LINE>Or fear of my miscarrying on his scape,</LINE>
<LINE>Or both.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WOOER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="2">&#8217;Tis likely.</LINE>

<LINE offset="5">But why all this haste, sir?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WOOER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll tell you quickly. As I late was angling</LINE>
<LINE>In the great lake that lies behind the palace,</LINE>
<LINE>From the far shore, thick set with reeds and sedges,</LINE>
<LINE>As patiently I was attending sport,</LINE>
<LINE>I heard a voice, a shrill one; and attentive</LINE>
<LINE>I gave my ear, when I might well perceive</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Twas one that sung, and by the smallness of it,</LINE>
<LINE>A boy or woman. I then left my angle</LINE>
<LINE>To his own skill, came near, but yet perceiv&#8217;d not</LINE>
<LINE>Who made the sound, the rushes and the reeds</LINE>
<LINE>Had so encompass&#8217;d it. I laid me down</LINE>
<LINE>And list&#8217;ned to the words she sung, for then</LINE>
<LINE>Through a small glade cut by the fishermen,</LINE>
<LINE>I saw it was your daughter.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Pray go on, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WOOER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She sung much, but no sense; only I heard her</LINE>
<LINE>Repeat this often, &#8220;Palamon is gone,</LINE>
<LINE>Is gone to th&#8217; wood to gather mulberries.</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll find him out tomorrow.&#8221;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. FRIEND.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">Pretty soul!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WOOER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8220;His shackles will betray him, he&#8217;ll be taken,</LINE>
<LINE>And what shall I do then? I&#8217;ll bring a bevy,</LINE>
<LINE>A hundred black-ey&#8217;d maids that love as I do,</LINE>
<LINE>With chaplets on their heads of daffadillies,</LINE>
<LINE>With cherry lips and cheeks of damask roses,</LINE>
<LINE>And all we&#8217;ll dance an antic &#8217;fore the Duke,</LINE>
<LINE>And beg his pardon.&#8221; Then she talk&#8217;d of you, sir:</LINE>
<LINE>That you must lose your head tomorrow morning,</LINE>
<LINE>And she must gather flowers to bury you,</LINE>
<LINE>And see the house made handsome. Then she sung</LINE>
<LINE>Nothing but &#8220;Willow, willow, willow,&#8221; and between</LINE>
<LINE>Ever was &#8220;Palamon, fair Palamon,&#8221;</LINE>
<LINE>And &#8220;Palamon was a tall young man.&#8221; The place</LINE>
<LINE>Was knee-deep where she sat; her careless tresses</LINE>
<LINE>A wreath of bulrush rounded; about her stuck</LINE>
<LINE>Thousand fresh water-flowers of several colors,</LINE>
<LINE>That methought she appear&#8217;d like the fair nymph</LINE>
<LINE>That feeds the lake with waters, or as Iris</LINE>
<LINE>Newly dropp&#8217;d down from heaven. Rings she made</LINE>
<LINE>Of rushes that grew by, and to &#8217;em spoke</LINE>
<LINE>The prettiest posies&#8212;&#8220;Thus our true love&#8217;s tied,&#8221;</LINE>
<LINE>&#8220;This you may loose, not me,&#8221; and many a one;</LINE>
<LINE>And then she wept, and sung again, and sigh&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>And with the same breath smil&#8217;d, and kiss&#8217;d her hand.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>She saw me, and straight sought the flood. I sav&#8217;d her,</LINE>
<LINE>And set her safe to land; when presently</LINE>
<LINE>She slipp&#8217;d away, and to the city made</LINE>
<LINE>With such a cry and swiftness that, believe me,</LINE>
<LINE>She left me far behind her. Three or four</LINE>
<LINE>I saw from far off cross her&#8212;one of &#8217;em</LINE>
<LINE>I knew to be your brother; where she stay&#8217;d,</LINE>

<LINE>Yet I may bind those wounds up, that must open</LINE>
<LINE>And bleed to death for my sake else. I&#8217;ll choose,</LINE>
<LINE>And end their strife. Two such young handsome men</LINE>
<LINE>Shall never fall for me; their weeping mothers,</LINE>
<LINE>Following the dead-cold ashes of their sons,</LINE>
<LINE>Shall never curse my cruelty. Good heaven,</LINE>
<LINE>What a sweet face has Arcite! If wise Nature,</LINE>
<LINE>With all her best endowments, all those beauties</LINE>
<LINE>She sows into the births of noble bodies,</LINE>
<LINE>Were here a mortal woman, and had in her</LINE>
<LINE>The coy denials of young maids, yet doubtless</LINE>
<LINE>She would run mad for this man. What an eye,</LINE>
<LINE>Of what a fiery sparkle and quick sweetness,</LINE>
<LINE>Has this young prince! Here Love himself sits smiling.</LINE>
<LINE>Just such another wanton Ganymede</LINE>
<LINE>Set Jove afire with, and enforc&#8217;d the god</LINE>
<LINE>Snatch up the goodly boy and set him by him,</LINE>
<LINE>A shining constellation. What a brow,</LINE>
<LINE>Of what a spacious majesty, he carries,</LINE>
<LINE>Arch&#8217;d like the great-ey&#8217;d Juno&#8217;s, but far sweeter,</LINE>
<LINE>Smoother than Pelops&#8217; shoulder! Fame and Honor</LINE>
<LINE>Methinks from hence, as from a promontory</LINE>
<LINE>Pointed in heaven, should clap their wings and sing</LINE>
<LINE>To all the under world the loves and fights</LINE>
<LINE>Of gods and such men near &#8217;em. Palamon</LINE>
<LINE>Is but his foil, to him, a mere dull shadow;</LINE>
<LINE>He&#8217;s swarth and meagre, of an eye as heavy</LINE>
<LINE>As if he had lost his mother; a still temper,</LINE>
<LINE>No stirring in him, no alacrity,</LINE>
<LINE>Of all this sprightly sharpness, not a smile.</LINE>
<LINE>Yet these that we count errors may become him:</LINE>
<LINE>Narcissus was a sad boy, but a heavenly.</LINE>
<LINE>O, who can find the bent of woman&#8217;s fancy?</LINE>
<LINE>I am a fool, my reason is lost in me;</LINE>
<LINE>I have no choice, and I have lied so lewdly</LINE>
<LINE>That women ought to beat me. On my knees</LINE>
<LINE>I ask thy pardon: Palamon, thou art alone</LINE>
<LINE>And only beautiful, and these the eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>These the bright lamps of beauty, that command</LINE>
<LINE>And threaten Love, and what young maid dare cross &#8217;em?</LINE>
<LINE>What a bold gravity, and yet inviting,</LINE>
<LINE>Has this brown manly face! O Love, this only</LINE>
<LINE>From this hour is complexion. Lie there, Arcite,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou art a changeling to him, a mere gypsy,</LINE>
<LINE>And this the noble body. I am sotted,</LINE>
<LINE>Utterly lost. My virgin&#8217;s faith has fled me;</LINE>
<LINE>For if my brother but even now had ask&#8217;d me</LINE>
<LINE>Whether I lov&#8217;d, I had run mad for Arcite;</LINE>
<LINE>Now if my sister&#8212;more for Palamon.</LINE>
<LINE>Stand both together: now, come ask me, brother&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Alas, I know not! Ask me now, sweet sister&#8212;</LINE>

<LINE>Quickly, by any means, I long to see &#8217;em.&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Your two contending lovers are return&#8217;d,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>From whence come you, sir?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. MESS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">From the knights.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="9">Pray speak,</LINE>
<LINE>You that have seen them, what they are.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. MESS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="8">I will, sir,</LINE>
<LINE>And truly what I think. Six braver spirits</LINE>
<LINE>Than these they have brought (if we judge by the outside)</LINE>
<LINE>I never saw nor read of. He that stands</LINE>
<LINE>In the first place with Arcite, by his seeming</LINE>
<LINE>Should be a stout man, by his face a prince</LINE>
<LINE>(His very looks so say him), his complexion</LINE>
<LINE>Nearer a brown than black; stern, and yet noble,</LINE>
<LINE>Which shows him hardy, fearless, proud of dangers.</LINE>
<LINE>The circles of his eyes show fire within him,</LINE>
<LINE>And as a heated lion, so he looks;</LINE>
<LINE>His hair hangs long behind him, black and shining</LINE>
<LINE>Like ravens&#8217; wings; his shoulders broad and strong,</LINE>
<LINE>Arm&#8217;d long and round, and on his thigh a sword</LINE>
<LINE>Hung by a curious baldrick, when he frowns</LINE>
<LINE>To seal his will with. Better, o&#8217; my conscience,</LINE>
<LINE>Was never soldier&#8217;s friend.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou hast well describ&#8217;d him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PIR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">Yet a great deal short,</LINE>
<LINE>Methinks, of him that&#8217;s first with Palamon.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pray speak him, friend.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PIR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">I guess he is a prince too,</LINE>
<LINE>And if it may be, greater; for his show</LINE>
<LINE>Has all the ornament of honor in&#8217;t.</LINE>
<LINE>He&#8217;s somewhat bigger than the knight he spoke of,</LINE>
<LINE>But of a face far sweeter; his complexion</LINE>
<LINE>Is, as a ripe grape, ruddy. He has felt</LINE>
<LINE>Without doubt what he fights for, and so apter</LINE>
<LINE>To make this cause his own. In &#8217;s face appears</LINE>
<LINE>All the fair hopes of what he undertakes,</LINE>
<LINE>And when he&#8217;s angry, then a settled valor</LINE>
<LINE>(Not tainted with extremes) runs through his body,</LINE>
<LINE>And guides his arm to brave things. Fear he cannot,</LINE>
<LINE>He shows no such soft temper. His head&#8217;s yellow,</LINE>
<LINE>Hard-hair&#8217;d, and curl&#8217;d, thick twin&#8217;d like ivy-tods,</LINE>
<LINE>Not to undo with thunder. In his face</LINE>
<LINE>The livery of the warlike maid appears,</LINE>
<LINE>Pure red and white, for yet no beard has blest him;</LINE>
<LINE>And in his rolling eyes sits victory,</LINE>
<LINE>As if she ever meant to crown his valor.</LINE>
<LINE>His nose stands high, a character of honor;</LINE>
<LINE>His red lips, after fights, are fit for ladies.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EMIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Must these men die too?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PIR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">When he speaks, his tongue</LINE>
<LINE>Sounds like a trumpet. All his lineaments</LINE>
<LINE>Are as a man would wish &#8217;em, strong and clean.</LINE>
<LINE>He wears a well-steel&#8217;d axe, the staff of gold.</LINE>
<LINE>His age some five and twenty.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. MESS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">There&#8217;s another,</LINE>
<LINE>A little man, but of a tough soul, seeming</LINE>
<LINE>As great as any. Fairer promises</LINE>
<LINE>In such a body yet I never look&#8217;d on.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PIR.</SPEAKER>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PIR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Yes, they are well.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. MESS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="9">Methinks,</LINE>
<LINE>Being so few and well dispos&#8217;d, they show</LINE>
<LINE>Great and fine art in nature. He&#8217;s white-hair&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Not wanton white, but such a manly color</LINE>
<LINE>Next to an aborn; tough and nimble set,</LINE>
<LINE>Which shows an active soul; his arms are brawny,</LINE>
<LINE>Lin&#8217;d with strong sinews; to the shoulder-piece</LINE>
<LINE>Gently they swell, like women new conceiv&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Which speaks him prone to labor, never fainting</LINE>
<LINE>Under the weight of arms; stout-hearted, still,</LINE>
<LINE>But when he stirs, a tiger. He&#8217;s grey-ey&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Which yields compassion where he conquers; sharp</LINE>
<LINE>To spy advantages, and where he finds &#8217;em,</LINE>
<LINE>He&#8217;s swift to make &#8217;em his. He does no wrongs,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor takes none. He&#8217;s round-fac&#8217;d, and when he smiles</LINE>
<LINE>He shows a lover, when he frowns, a soldier.</LINE>
<LINE>About his head he wears the winner&#8217;s oak,</LINE>
<LINE>And in it stuck the favor of his lady.</LINE>
<LINE>His age some six and thirty. In his hand</LINE>
<LINE>He bears a charging-staff emboss&#8217;d with silver.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Lady, you shall see men fight now.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>HIP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">I wish it,</LINE>
<LINE>But not the cause, my lord. They would show</LINE>
<LINE>Bravely about the titles of two kingdoms.</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis pity love should be so tyrannous.</LINE>
<LINE>O my soft-hearted sister, what think you?</LINE>
<LINE>Weep not, till they weep blood. Wench, it must be.</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She is continually in a harmless distemper, sleeps little, altogether without appetite, save often drinking, dreaming of another world and a better; and what broken piece of matter soe&#8217;er she&#8217;s about, the name Palamon lards it, that she farces ev&#8217;ry business withal, fits it to every question.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Daughter.</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>I have forgot it quite; the burden on&#8217;t was &#8220;Down-a, down-a,&#8221; and penn&#8217;d by no worse man than Giraldo, Emilia&#8217;s schoolmaster. He&#8217;s as fantastical, too, as ever he may go upon &#8217;s legs, for in the next world will Dido see Palamon, and then will she be out of love with Aeneas.</LINE>

<LINE>Now for this charm that I told you of, you must bring a piece of silver on the tip of your tongue, or no ferry. Then, if it be your chance to come where the blessed spirits&#8212;as there&#8217;s a sight now! We maids that have our livers perish&#8217;d, crack&#8217;d to pieces with love, we shall come there, and do nothing all day long but pick flowers with Proserpine. Then will I make Palamon a nosegay, then let him mark me&#8212;then&#8212;</LINE>

<LINE>Faith, I&#8217;ll tell you; sometime we go to barley-break, we of the blessed. Alas, &#8217;tis a sore life they have i&#8217; th&#8217; tother place, such burning, frying, boiling, hissing, howling, chatt&#8217;ring, cursing! O, they have shrowd measure! Take heed: if one be mad, or hang or drown themselves, thither they go&#8212;Jupiter bless us!&#8212;and there shall we be put in a cauldron of lead and usurers&#8217; grease, amongst a whole million of cutpurses, and there boil like a gammon of bacon that will never be enough.</LINE>

<LINE>Lords and courtiers that have got maids with child, they are in this place. They shall stand in fire up to the nav&#8217;l, and in ice up to th&#8217; heart, and there th&#8217; offending part burns, and the deceiving part freezes: in troth a very grievous punishment, as one would think, for such a trifle.

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DAUGH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To hear there a proud lady and a proud city-wife howl together! I were a beast and I&#8217;ld call it good sport.

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOCT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Understand you she ever affected any man ere she beheld Palamon?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I was once, sir, in great hope she had fix&#8217;d her liking on this gentleman, my friend.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WOOER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I did think so too, and would account I had a great penn&#8217;worth on&#8217;t to give half my state that both she and I at this present stood unfeignedly on the same terms.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOCT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That intemp&#8217;rate surfeit of her eye hath distemper&#8217;d the other senses. They may return and settle again to execute their preordain&#8217;d faculties, but they are now in a most extravagant vagary. This you must do: confine her to a place where the light may rather seem to steal in than be permitted. Take upon you, young sir her friend, the name of Palamon, say you come to eat with her, and to commune of love. This will catch her attention, for this her mind beats upon; other objects that are inserted &#8217;tween her mind and eye become the pranks and friskins of her madness. Sing to her such green songs of love as she says Palamon hath sung in prison. Come to her, stuck in as sweet flowers as the season is mistress of, and thereto make an addition of some other compounded odors which are grateful to the sense. All this shall become Palamon, for Palamon can sing, and Palamon is sweet, and ev&#8217;ry good thing. Desire to eat with her, carve her, drink to her, and still among intermingle your petition of grace and acceptance into her favor. Learn what maids have been her companions and play-feres, and let them repair to her with Palamon in their mouths, and appear with tokens, as if they suggested for him. It is a falsehood she is in, which is with falsehoods to be combated. This may bring her to eat, to sleep, and reduce what&#8217;s now out of square in her into their former law and regiment. I have seen it approv&#8217;d, how many times I know not, but to make the number more I have great hope in this. I will, between the passages of this project, come in with my appliance. Let us put it in execution; and hasten the success, which doubt not will bring forth comfort.</LINE>

<LINE>Knights, kinsmen, lovers, yea, my sacrifices,</LINE>
<LINE>True worshippers of Mars, whose spirit in you</LINE>
<LINE>Expels the seeds of fear, and th&#8217; apprehension</LINE>
<LINE>Which still is farther off it, go with me</LINE>
<LINE>Before the god of our profession. There</LINE>
<LINE>Require of him the hearts of lions and</LINE>
<LINE>The breath of tigers, yea, the fierceness too,</LINE>
<LINE>Yea, the speed also&#8212;to go on, I mean,</LINE>
<LINE>Else wish we to be snails. You know my prize</LINE>
<LINE>Must be dragg&#8217;d out of blood; force and great feat</LINE>
<LINE>Must put my garland on, where she sticks</LINE>
<LINE>The queen of flowers. Our intercession then</LINE>
<LINE>Must be to him that makes the camp a cestron</LINE>
<LINE>Brimm&#8217;d with the blood of men. Give me your aid</LINE>
<LINE>And bend your spirits towards him.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>They advance to the altar of Mars and fall on their faces; then kneel.</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>Thou mighty one, that with thy power hast turn&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>Green Neptune into purple; whose approach</LINE>
<LINE>Comets prewarn, whose havoc in vast field</LINE>
<LINE>Unearthed skulls proclaim, whose breath blows down</LINE>
<LINE>The teeming Ceres&#8217; foison, who dost pluck</LINE>
<LINE>With hand armipotent from forth blue clouds</LINE>
<LINE>The mason&#8217;d turrets, that both mak&#8217;st and break&#8217;st</LINE>
<LINE>The stony girths of cities: me thy pupil,</LINE>
<LINE>Youngest follower of thy drum, instruct this day</LINE>
<LINE>With military skill, that to thy laud</LINE>
<LINE>I may advance my streamer, and by thee</LINE>
<LINE>Be styl&#8217;d the lord o&#8217; th&#8217; day. Give me, great Mars,</LINE>
<LINE>Some token of thy pleasure.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Here they fall on their faces as formerly, and there is heard clanging of armor, with a short thunder, as the burst of a battle, whereupon they all rise and bow to the altar.</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>O great corrector of enormous times,</LINE>
<LINE>Shaker of o&#8217;er-rank states, thou grand decider</LINE>
<LINE>Of dusty and old titles, that heal&#8217;st with blood</LINE>
<LINE>The earth when it is sick, and cur&#8217;st the world</LINE>
<LINE>O&#8217; th&#8217; plurisy of people! I do take</LINE>
<LINE>Thy signs auspiciously, and in thy name</LINE>

<LINE>You whose free nobleness do make my cause</LINE>
<LINE>Your personal hazard. To the goddess Venus</LINE>
<LINE>Commend we our proceeding, and implore</LINE>
<LINE>Her power unto our party.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Here they advance to the altar of Venus, and fall on their faces; then kneel, as formerly.</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>Hail, sovereign queen of secrets, who hast power</LINE>
<LINE>To call the fiercest tyrant from his rage,</LINE>
<LINE>And weep unto a girl; that hast the might,</LINE>
<LINE>Even with an eye-glance, to choke Mars&#8217;s drum</LINE>
<LINE>And turn th&#8217; alarm to whispers; that canst make</LINE>
<LINE>A cripple flourish with his crutch, and cure him</LINE>
<LINE>Before Apollo; that mayst force the king</LINE>
<LINE>To be his subject&#8217;s vassal, and induce</LINE>
<LINE>Stale gravity to dance; the poll&#8217;d bachelor,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose youth, like wanton boys through bonfires,</LINE>
<LINE>Have skipp&#8217;d thy flame, at seventy thou canst catch,</LINE>
<LINE>And make him, to the scorn of his hoarse throat,</LINE>
<LINE>Abuse young lays of love. What godlike power</LINE>
<LINE>Hast thou not power upon? To Phoebus thou</LINE>
<LINE>Add&#8217;st flames, hotter than his; the heavenly fires</LINE>
<LINE>Did scorch his mortal son, thine him. The huntress</LINE>
<LINE>All moist and cold, some say, began to throw</LINE>
<LINE>Her bow away, and sigh. Take to thy grace</LINE>
<LINE>Me thy vow&#8217;d soldier, who do bear thy yoke</LINE>
<LINE>As &#8217;twere a wreath of roses, yet is heavier</LINE>
<LINE>Than lead itself, stings more than nettles. I</LINE>
<LINE>Have never been foul-mouth&#8217;d against thy law,</LINE>
<LINE>Nev&#8217;r reveal&#8217;d secret, for I knew none&#8212;would not,</LINE>
<LINE>Had I kenn&#8217;d all that were. I never practiced</LINE>
<LINE>Upon man&#8217;s wife, nor would the libels read</LINE>
<LINE>Of liberal wits. I never at great feasts</LINE>
<LINE>Sought to betray a beauty, but have blush&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>At simp&#8217;ring sirs that did. I have been harsh</LINE>
<LINE>To large confessors, and have hotly ask&#8217;d them</LINE>
<LINE>If they had mothers; I had one, a woman,</LINE>
<LINE>And women &#8217;twere they wrong&#8217;d. I knew a man</LINE>
<LINE>Of eighty winters&#8212;this I told them&#8212;who</LINE>
<LINE>A lass of fourteen brided. &#8217;Twas thy power</LINE>
<LINE>To put life into dust: the aged cramp</LINE>
<LINE>Had screw&#8217;d his square foot round,</LINE>
<LINE>The gout had knit his fingers into knots,</LINE>
<LINE>Torturing convulsions from his globy eyes</LINE>
<LINE>Had almost drawn their spheres, that what was life</LINE>
<LINE>In him seem&#8217;d torture. This anatomy</LINE>
<LINE>Had by his young fair fere a boy, and I</LINE>
<LINE>Believ&#8217;d it was his, for she swore it was,</LINE>
<LINE>And who would not believe her? Brief, I am</LINE>
<LINE>To those that prate and have done, no companion;</LINE>
<LINE>To those that boast and have not, a defier;</LINE>
<LINE>To those that would and cannot, a rejoicer.</LINE>
<LINE>Yea, him I do not love that tells close offices</LINE>
<LINE>The foulest way, nor names concealments in</LINE>
<LINE>The boldest language. Such a one I am,</LINE>
<LINE>And vow that lover never yet made sigh</LINE>
<LINE>Truer than I. O then, most soft sweet goddess,</LINE>
<LINE>Give me the victory of this question, which</LINE>
<LINE>Is true love&#8217;s merit, and bless me with a sign</LINE>
<LINE>Of thy great pleasure.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Here music is heard; doves are seen to flutter. They fall again upon their faces, then on their knees.</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>O thou that from eleven to ninety reign&#8217;st</LINE>
<LINE>In mortal bosoms, whose chase is this world,</LINE>
<LINE>And we in herds thy game, I give thee thanks</LINE>
<LINE>For this fair token, which being laid unto</LINE>
<LINE>Mine innocent true heart, arms in assurance</LINE>
<LINE>My body to this business.&#8212;Let us rise</LINE>
<LINE>And bow before the goddess. Time comes on.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>They bow. Exeunt.</STAGEDIR>

<STAGEDIR>Still music of records. Enter Emilia in white, her hair about her shoulders, and wearing a wheaten wreath; one in white holding up her train, her hair stuck with flowers; one before her carrying a silver hind, in which is convey&#8217;d incense and sweet odors, which being set upon the altar of Diana, her maids standing aloof, she sets fire to it; then they curtsy and kneel.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EMIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O sacred, shadowy, cold, and constant queen,</LINE>
<LINE>Abandoner of revels, mute, contemplative,</LINE>
<LINE>Sweet, solitary, white as chaste, and pure</LINE>
<LINE>As wind-fann&#8217;d snow, who to thy female knights</LINE>
<LINE>Allow&#8217;st no more blood than will make a blush,</LINE>
<LINE>Which is their order&#8217;s robe: I here, thy priest,</LINE>
<LINE>Am humbled &#8217;fore thine altar. O, vouchsafe,</LINE>
<LINE>With that thy rare green eye&#8212;which never yet</LINE>
<LINE>Beheld thing maculate&#8212;look on thy virgin,</LINE>
<LINE>And, sacred silver mistress, lend thine ear</LINE>
<LINE>(Which nev&#8217;r heard scurril term, into whose port</LINE>
<LINE>Ne&#8217;er ent&#8217;red wanton sound) to my petition,</LINE>
<LINE>Season&#8217;d with holy fear. This is my last</LINE>
<LINE>Of vestal office; I am bride-habited,</LINE>
<LINE>But maiden-hearted. A husband I have &#8217;pointed,</LINE>
<LINE>But do not know him. Out of two I should</LINE>
<LINE>Choose one, and pray for his success, but I</LINE>
<LINE>Am guiltless of election. Of mine eyes</LINE>
<LINE>Were I to lose one, they are equal precious,</LINE>
<LINE>I could doom neither; that which perish&#8217;d should</LINE>
<LINE>Go to&#8217;t unsentenc&#8217;d. Therefore, most modest queen,</LINE>
<LINE>He of the two pretenders that best loves me</LINE>
<LINE>And has the truest title in&#8217;t, let him</LINE>
<LINE>Take off my wheaten garland, or else grant</LINE>
<LINE>The file and quality I hold I may</LINE>
<LINE>Continue in thy band.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Here the hind vanishes under the altar, and in the place ascends a rose tree, having one rose upon it.</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>See what our general of ebbs and flows</LINE>
<LINE>Out from the bowels of her holy altar</LINE>
<LINE>With sacred act advances: but one rose!</LINE>
<LINE>If well inspir&#8217;d, this battle shall confound</LINE>
<LINE>Both these brave knights, and I, a virgin flow&#8217;r,</LINE>
<LINE>Must grow alone, unpluck&#8217;d.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Here is heard a sudden twang of instruments, and the rose falls from the tree, which vanishes under the altar.</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>The flow&#8217;r is fall&#8217;n, the tree descends. O mistress,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou here dischargest me. I shall be gather&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>I think so, but I know not thine own will:</LINE>
<LINE>Unclasp thy mystery.&#8212;I hope she&#8217;s pleas&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Her signs were gracious.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>DOCT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Has this advice I told you done any good upon her?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WOOER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, very much; the maids that kept her company</LINE>
<LINE>Have half persuaded her that I am Palamon.</LINE>
<LINE>Within this half hour she came smiling to me,</LINE>
<LINE>And ask&#8217;d me what I would eat, and when I would kiss her.</LINE>
<LINE>I told her, presently, and kiss&#8217;d her twice.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOCT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;Twas well done. Twenty times had been far better,</LINE>
<LINE>For there the cure lies mainly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WOOER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">Then she told me</LINE>
<LINE>She would watch with me tonight, for well she knew</LINE>

<LINE>Yet very well, sir.</LINE>

<LINE>What think you of this horse?</LINE>

<SPEAKER>DAUGH.</SPEAKER>

<LINE offset="5">Farewell, sister,</LINE>
<LINE>I am like to know your husband &#8217;fore yourself</LINE>

<LINE>Be made your lot.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt Theseus, Hippolyta, Pirithous, etc.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EMIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Arcite is gently visag&#8217;d; yet his eye</LINE>
<LINE>Is like an engine bent, or a sharp weapon</LINE>
<LINE>In a soft sheath; mercy and manly courage</LINE>
<LINE>Are bedfellows in his visage. Palamon</LINE>
<LINE>Has a most menacing aspect, his brow</LINE>
<LINE>Is grav&#8217;d, and seems to bury what it frowns on,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet sometime &#8217;tis not so, but alters to</LINE>
<LINE>The quality of his thoughts; long time his eye</LINE>
<LINE>Will dwell upon his object; melancholy</LINE>
<LINE>Becomes him nobly. So does Arcite&#8217;s mirth,</LINE>
<LINE>But Palamon&#8217;s sadness is a kind of mirth,</LINE>
<LINE>So mingled as if mirth did make him sad,</LINE>
<LINE>And sadness merry; those darker humors that</LINE>
<LINE>Stick misbecomingly on others, on him</LINE>
<LINE>Live in fair dwelling.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Cornets. Trumpets sound as to a charge.</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>Hark how yon spurs to spirit do incite</LINE>
<LINE>The princes to their proof! Arcite may win me,</LINE>
<LINE>And yet may Palamon wound Arcite to</LINE>
<LINE>The spoiling of his figure. O, what pity</LINE>
<LINE>Enough for such a chance? If I were by,</LINE>
<LINE>I might do hurt, for they would glance their eyes</LINE>
<LINE>Toward my seat, and in that motion might</LINE>
<LINE>Omit a ward, or forfeit an offense,</LINE>
<LINE>Which crav&#8217;d that very time. It is much better</LINE>
<LINE>I am not there. O, better never born</LINE>
<LINE>Than minister to such harm!</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Cornets. A great cry and noise within, crying &#8220;A Palamon!&#8221; </STAGEDIR>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Servant.</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>Then he has won. &#8217;Twas ever likely:</LINE>
<LINE>He look&#8217;d all grace and success, and he is</LINE>
<LINE>Doubtless the prim&#8217;st of men. I prithee run</LINE>
<LINE>And tell me how it goes.</LINE>

<LINE offset="4">Poor servant, thou hast lost.</LINE>
<LINE>Upon my right side still I wore thy picture,</LINE>
<LINE>Palamon&#8217;s on the left. Why so, I know not;</LINE>
<LINE>I had no end in&#8217;t else; chance would have it so.</LINE>
<LINE>On the sinister side the heart lies; Palamon</LINE>
<LINE>Had the best-boding chance.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Another cry, and shout within, and cornets.</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>Was general &#8220;A Palamon!&#8221;; but anon</LINE>
<LINE>Th&#8217; assistants made a brave redemption, and</LINE>

<LINE>Their nobleness peculiar to them, gives</LINE>
<LINE>The prejudice of disparity, value&#8217;s shortness,</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Cornets. Cry within, &#8220;Arcite, Arcite!&#8221; </STAGEDIR>

<LINE>The combat&#8217;s consummation is proclaim&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>By the wind instruments.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EMIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Half-sights saw</LINE>
<LINE>That Arcite was no babe. God&#8217;s lid, his richness</LINE>
<LINE>And costliness of spirit look&#8217;d through him, it could</LINE>
<LINE>No more be hid in him than fire in flax,</LINE>
<LINE>Than humble banks can go to law with waters</LINE>
<LINE>That drift-winds force to raging. I did think</LINE>
<LINE>Good Palamon would miscarry, yet I knew not</LINE>
<LINE>Why I did think so. Our reasons are not prophets</LINE>
<LINE>When oft our fancies are. They are coming off.</LINE>
<LINE>Alas, poor Palamon!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Cornets.</STAGEDIR>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Theseus, Hippolyta, Pirithous, Arcite as victor, and Attendants, etc.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Lo, where our sister is in expectation,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet quaking and unsettled. Fairest Emily,</LINE>
<LINE>The gods by their divine arbitrement</LINE>
<LINE>Have given you this knight: he is a good one</LINE>
<LINE>As ever strook at head. Give me your hands.</LINE>
<LINE>Receive you her, you him, be plighted with</LINE>
<LINE>A love that grows as you decay.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">Emily,</LINE>
<LINE>To buy you I have lost what&#8217;s dearest to me</LINE>
<LINE>Save what is bought, and yet I purchase cheaply,</LINE>
<LINE>As I do rate your value.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">O loved sister,</LINE>
<LINE>He speaks now of as brave a knight as e&#8217;er</LINE>
<LINE>Did spur a noble steed. Surely the gods</LINE>
<LINE>Would have him die a bachelor, lest his race</LINE>
<LINE>Should show i&#8217; th&#8217; world too godlike. His behavior</LINE>
<LINE>So charm&#8217;d me that methought Alcides was</LINE>
<LINE>To him a sow of lead. If I could praise</LINE>
<LINE>Each part of him to th&#8217; all I have spoke, your Arcite</LINE>
<LINE>Did not lose by&#8217;t; for he that was thus good</LINE>
<LINE>Encount&#8217;red yet his better. I have heard</LINE>
<LINE>Two emulous Philomels beat the ear o&#8217; th&#8217; night</LINE>
<LINE>With their contentious throats, now one the higher,</LINE>
<LINE>Anon the other, then again the first,</LINE>
<LINE>And by and by out-breasted, that the sense</LINE>
<LINE>Could not be judge between &#8217;em. So it far&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>Good space between these kinsmen; till heavens did</LINE>
<LINE>Make hardly one the winner.&#8212;Wear the girlond</LINE>
<LINE>With joy that you have won.&#8212;For the subdu&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Give them our present justice, since I know</LINE>
<LINE>Their lives but pinch &#8217;em. Let it here be done.</LINE>
<LINE>The scene&#8217;s not for our seeing, go we hence,</LINE>
<LINE>Right joyful, with some sorrow.&#8212;Arm your prize,</LINE>
<LINE>I know you will not loose her.&#8212;Hippolyta,</LINE>
<LINE>I see one eye of yours conceives a tear,</LINE>
<LINE>The which it will deliver.</LINE>

<LINE>We have by so considering: we expire,</LINE>

<LINE>Have their good wishes; we prevent</LINE>
<LINE>The loathsome misery of age, beguile</LINE>

<LINE>For grey approachers; we come towards the gods</LINE>
<LINE>Young and unwapper&#8217;d, not halting under crimes</LINE>
<LINE>Many and stale. That sure shall please the gods</LINE>
<LINE>Sooner than such, to give us nectar with &#8217;em,</LINE>
<LINE>For we are more clear spirits. My dear kinsmen,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PIR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">List then: your cousin,</LINE>
<LINE>Mounted upon a steed that Emily</LINE>
<LINE>Did first bestow on him&#8212;a black one, owing</LINE>
<LINE>Not a hair-worth of white, which some will say</LINE>
<LINE>Weakens his price, and many will not buy</LINE>
<LINE>His goodness with this note; which superstition</LINE>
<LINE>Here finds allowance&#8212;on this horse is Arcite</LINE>
<LINE>Trotting the stones of Athens, which the calkins</LINE>
<LINE>Did rather tell than trample; for the horse</LINE>
<LINE>Would make his length a mile, if&#8217;t pleas&#8217;d his rider</LINE>
<LINE>To put pride in him. As he thus went counting</LINE>
<LINE>The flinty pavement, dancing as &#8217;twere to th&#8217; music</LINE>
<LINE>His own hoofs made (for as they say from iron</LINE>
<LINE>Came music&#8217;s origin), what envious flint,</LINE>
<LINE>Cold as old Saturn, and like him possess&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>With fire malevolent, darted a spark,</LINE>
<LINE>Or what fierce sulphur else, to this end made,</LINE>
<LINE>I comment not&#8212;the hot horse, hot as fire,</LINE>
<LINE>Took toy at this, and fell to what disorder</LINE>
<LINE>His power could give his will, bounds, comes on end,</LINE>
<LINE>Forgets school-doing, being therein train&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>And of kind manage; pig-like he whines</LINE>
<LINE>At the sharp rowel, which he frets at rather</LINE>
<LINE>Than any jot obeys; seeks all foul means</LINE>
<LINE>Of boist&#8217;rous and rough jad&#8217;ry, to disseat</LINE>
<LINE>His lord that kept it bravely. When nought serv&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>When neither curb would crack, girth break, nor diff&#8217;ring plunges</LINE>
<LINE>Disroot his rider whence he grew, but that</LINE>
<LINE>He kept him &#8217;tween his legs, on his hind hoofs</LINE>
<LINE>On end he stands,</LINE>
<LINE>That Arcite&#8217;s legs, being higher than his head,</LINE>
<LINE>Seem&#8217;d with strange art to hang. His victor&#8217;s wreath</LINE>
<LINE>Even then fell off his head; and presently</LINE>
<LINE>Backward the jade comes o&#8217;er, and his full poise</LINE>
<LINE>Becomes the rider&#8217;s load. Yet is he living,</LINE>
<LINE>But such a vessel &#8217;tis that floats but for</LINE>
<LINE>The surge that next approaches. He much desires</LINE>

<LINE>The blissful dew of heaven does arrouse you.</LINE>
<LINE>The powerful Venus well hath grac&#8217;d her altar,</LINE>
<LINE>And given you your love. Our master Mars</LINE>
<LINE>Hath vouch&#8217;d his oracle, and to Arcite gave</LINE>

<LINE>Did lie in you, for you first saw her, and</LINE>
<LINE>Even then proclaim&#8217;d your fancy. He restor&#8217;d her</LINE>
<LINE>As your stol&#8217;n jewel, and desir&#8217;d your spirit</LINE>
<LINE>To send him hence forgiven. The gods my justice</LINE>
<LINE>Take from my hand, and they themselves become</LINE>
<LINE>The executioners. Lead your lady off;</LINE>
<LINE>And call your lovers from the stage of death,</LINE>
<LINE>Whom I adopt my friends. A day or two</LINE>
<LINE>Let us look sadly, and give grace unto</LINE>

<LINE>As glad of Arcite; and am now as glad</LINE>
<LINE>As for him sorry. O you heavenly charmers,</LINE>
<LINE>What things you make of us! For what we lack</LINE>
