<line>New plays and maidenheads are near akin&#8212;</line>
<line>Much follow&#8217;d both, for both much money gi&#8217;n,</line>
<line>If they stand sound and well; and a good play</line>
<line>(Whose modest scenes blush on his marriage-day,</line>
<line>And shake to lose his honor) is like her</line>
<line>That after holy tie and first night&#8217;s stir,</line>
<line>Yet still is modesty, and still retains</line>
<line>More of the maid to sight than husband&#8217;s pains.</line>
<line>We pray our play may be so; for I am sure</line>
<line>It has a noble breeder and a pure,</line>
<line>A learned, and a poet never went</line>
<line>More famous yet &#8217;twixt Po and silver Trent.</line>
<line>Chaucer (of all admir&#8217;d) the story gives;</line>
<line>There constant to eternity it lives.</line>
<line>If we let fall the nobleness of this,</line>
<line>And the first sound this child hear be a hiss,</line>
<line>How will it shake the bones of that good man,</line>
<line>And make him cry from under ground, &#8220;O, fan</line>
<line>From me the witless chaff of such a writer</line>
<line>That blasts my bays and my fam&#8217;d works makes lighter</line>
<line>Than Robin Hood!&#8221; This is the fear we bring;</line>
<line>For to say truth, it were an endless thing,</line>
<line>And too ambitious, to aspire to him,</line>
<line>Weak as we are, and almost breathless swim</line>
<line>In this deep water. Do but you hold out</line>
<line>Your helping hands, and we shall tack about</line>
<line>And something do to save us. You shall hear</line>
<line>Scenes, though below his art, may yet appear</line>
<line>Worth two hours&#8217; travail. To his bones sweet sleep!</line>
<line>Content to you! If this play do not keep</line>
<line>A little dull time from us, we perceive</line>
<line>Our losses fall so thick we must needs leave.</line>

<line>Now for the love of him whom Jove hath mark&#8217;d</line>
<line>The honor of your bed, and for the sake</line>
<line>Of clear virginity, be advocate</line>
<line>For us and our distresses! This good deed</line>
<line>Shall raze you out o&#8217; th&#8217; book of trespasses</line>
<line>All you are set down there.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>1. QUEEN.</speaker>
<line>We are three queens, whose sovereigns fell before</line>
<line>The wrath of cruel Creon; who endured</line>
<line>The beaks of ravens, talents of the kites,</line>
<line>And pecks of crows in the foul fields of Thebes.</line>
<line>He will not suffer us to bum their bones,</line>
<line>To urn their ashes, nor to take th&#8217; offense</line>
<line>Of mortal loathsomeness from the blest eye</line>
<line>Of holy Phoebus, but infects the winds</line>
<line>With stench of our slain lords. O, pity, Duke,</line>
<line>Thou purger of the earth, draw thy fear&#8217;d sword</line>
<line>That does good turns to th&#8217; world; give us the bones</line>
<line>Of our dead kings, that we may chapel them;</line>
<line>And of thy boundless goodness take some note</line>
<line>That for our crowned heads we have no roof,</line>
<line>Save this which is the lion&#8217;s, and the bear&#8217;s,</line>
<line>And vault to every thing!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>THE.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Pray you kneel not;</line>
<line>I was transported with your speech, and suffer&#8217;d</line>
<line>Your knees to wrong themselves. I have heard the fortunes</line>
<line>Of your dead lords, which gives me such lamenting</line>
<line>As wakes my vengeance and revenge for &#8217;em.</line>
<line>King Capaneus was your lord. The day</line>
<line>That he should marry you, at such a season</line>
<line>As now it is with me, I met your groom</line>
<line>By Mars&#8217;s altar. You were that time fair;</line>
<line>Not Juno&#8217;s mantle fairer than your tresses,</line>
<line>Nor in more bounty spread her. Your wheaten wreath</line>
<line>Was then nor thresh&#8217;d nor blasted; Fortune at you</line>
<line>Dimpled her cheek with smiles. Hercules our kinsman</line>
<line>(Then weaker than your eyes) laid by his club;</line>
<line>He tumbled down upon his Nemean hide,</line>
<line>And swore his sinews thaw&#8217;d. O grief and time,</line>
<line>Fearful consumers, you will all devour!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. QUEEN.</speaker>
<line>O, I hope some god,</line>
<line>Some god hath put his mercy in your manhood,</line>
<line>Whereto he&#8217;ll infuse pow&#8217;r, and press you forth</line>
<line>Our undertaker.</line>

<speaker>2. QUEEN.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Honored Hippolyta,</line>
<line>Most dreaded Amazonian, that hast slain</line>
<line>The scythe-tusk&#8217;d boar; that with thy arm, as strong</line>
<line>As it is white, wast near to make the male</line>
<line>To thy sex captive, but that this thy lord,</line>
<line>Born to uphold creation in that honor</line>
<line>First Nature styl&#8217;d it in, shrunk thee into</line>
<line>The bound thou wast o&#8217;erflowing, at once subduing</line>
<line>Thy force and thy affection; soldieress</line>
<line>That equally canst poise sternness with pity,</line>
<line>Whom now I know hast much more power on him</line>
<line>Than ever he had on thee, who ow&#8217;st his strength,</line>
<line>And his love too, who is a servant for</line>
<line>The tenor of thy speech; dear glass of ladies,</line>
<line>Bid him that we, whom flaming war doth scorch,</line>
<line>Under the shadow of his sword may cool us;</line>
<line>Require him he advance it o&#8217;er our heads;</line>
<line>Speak&#8217;t in a woman&#8217;s key&#8212;like such a woman</line>
<line>As any of us three; weep ere you fail;</line>
<line>Lend us a knee;</line>
<line>But touch the ground for us no longer time</line>
<line>Than a dove&#8217;s motion when the head&#8217;s pluck&#8217;d off;</line>
<line>Tell him, if he i&#8217; th&#8217; blood-siz&#8217;d field lay swoll&#8217;n,</line>
<line>Showing the sun his teeth, grinning at the moon,</line>
<line>What you would do.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>HIP.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Poor lady, say no more:</line>
<line>I had as lief trace this good action with you</line>
<line>As that whereto I am going, and never yet</line>
<line>Went I so willing way. My lord is taken</line>
<line>Heart-deep with your distress. Let him consider.</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll speak anon.</line>

<line offset="3">O, my petition was</line>


<stagedir>Kneel to Emilia.</stagedir>
<line>Set down in ice, which by hot grief uncandied</line>
<line>Melts into drops; so sorrow wanting form</line>
<line>Is press&#8217;d with deeper matter.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>EMIL.</speaker>
<line offset="6">Pray stand up,</line>
<line>Your grief is written in your cheek.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>3. QUEEN.</speaker>
<line offset="7">O, woe,</line>
<line>You cannot read it there. There, through my tears,</line>
<line>Like wrinkled pebbles in a glassy stream,</line>
<line>You may behold &#8217;em. Lady, lady, alack!</line>
<line>He that will all the treasure know o&#8217; th&#8217; earth</line>
<line>Must know the centre too; he that will fish</line>
<line>For my least minnow, let him lead his line</line>
<line>To catch one at my heart. O, pardon me,</line>
<line>Extremity, that sharpens sundry wits,</line>
<line>Makes me a fool.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>EMIL.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Pray you say nothing, pray you.</line>
<line>Who cannot feel nor see the rain, being in&#8217;t,</line>
<line>Knows neither wet nor dry. If that you were</line>
<line>The ground-piece of some painter, I would buy you</line>
<line>T&#8217; instruct me &#8217;gainst a capital grief indeed&#8212;</line>
<line>Such heart-pierc&#8217;d demonstration! But alas,</line>
<line>Being a natural sister of our sex,</line>
<line>Your sorrow beats so ardently upon me</line>
<line>That it shall make a counter-reflect &#8217;gainst</line>
<line>My brother&#8217;s heart, and warm it to some pity,</line>
<line>Though it were made of stone. Pray have good comfort.</line>
</speech>

<line>Forward to th&#8217; temple. Leave not out a jot</line>
<line>O&#8217; th&#8217; sacred ceremony.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>1. QUEEN.</speaker>
<line offset="5">O, this celebration</line>
<line>Will long last and be more costly than</line>
<line>Your suppliants&#8217; war! Remember that your fame</line>
<line>Knolls in the ear o&#8217; th&#8217; world; what you do quickly</line>
<line>Is not done rashly; your first thought is more</line>
<line>Than others&#8217; labored meditance; your premeditating</line>
<line>More than their actions. But, O Jove, your actions,</line>
<line>Soon as they move, as asprays do the fish,</line>
<line>Subdue before they touch. Think, dear Duke, think</line>
<line>What beds our slain kings have!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. QUEEN.</speaker>
<line offset="7">What griefs our beds</line>
<line>That our dear lords have none!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>3. QUEEN.</speaker>
<line offset="7">None fit for th&#8217; dead:</line>
<line>Those that with cords, knives, drams, precipitance,</line>
<line>Weary of this world&#8217;s light, have to themselves</line>
<line>Been death&#8217;s most horrid agents, humane grace</line>
<line>Affords them dust and shadow.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. QUEEN.</speaker>
<line offset="7">But our lords</line>
<line>Lie blist&#8217;ring &#8217;fore the visitating sun,</line>
<line>And were good kings when living.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>THE.</speaker>
<line>It is true; and I will give you comfort</line>
<line>To give your dead lords graves; the which to do</line>
<line>Must make some work with Creon.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. QUEEN.</speaker>
<line>And that work presents itself to th&#8217; doing:</line>
<line>Now &#8217;twill take form, the heats are gone tomorrow.</line>
<line>Then, bootless toil must recompense itself</line>
<line>With its own sweat; now he&#8217;s secure,</line>
<line>Not dreams we stand before your puissance</line>
<line>Wrinching our holy begging in our eyes</line>
<line>To make petition clear.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. QUEEN.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Now you may take him</line>
<line>Drunk with his victory.</line>

<line>For best solicitation?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>THE.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Why, good ladies,</line>
<line>This is a service, whereto I am going,</line>

<line>Her twinning cherries shall their sweetness fall</line>
<line>Upon thy tasteful lips, what wilt thou think</line>

<line>For what thou feel&#8217;st not? What thou feel&#8217;st being able</line>
<line>To make Mars spurn his drum. O, if thou couch</line>
<line>But one night with her, every hour in&#8217;t will</line>
<line>Take hostage of thee for a hundred, and</line>

<line>They died in perfume. On my head no toy</line>
<line>But was her pattern, her affections (pretty,</line>

<line>Stol&#8217;n some new air, or at adventure humm&#8217;d one</line>

<line>These strewings are for their chamber. &#8217;Tis pity they are in prison, and &#8217;twere pity they should be out. I do think they have patience to make any adversity asham&#8217;d. The prison itself is proud of &#8217;em; and they have all the world in their chamber.</line>

<line>Nay, most likely, for they are noble suff&#8217;rers. I marvel how they would have look&#8217;d had they been victors, that with such a constant nobility enforce a freedom out of bondage, making misery their mirth, and affliction a toy to jest at.</line>

<line>It seems to me they have no more sense of their captivity than I of ruling Athens. They eat well, look merrily, discourse of many things, but nothing of their own restraint and disasters. Yet sometime a divided sigh, martyr&#8217;d as &#8217;twere i&#8217; th&#8217; deliverance, will break from one of them; when the other presently gives it so sweet a rebuke that I could wish myself a sigh to be so chid, or at least a sigher to be comforted.</line>

<stagedir>Enter Palamon, and Arcite in prison.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>PAL.</speaker>
<line>How do you, noble cousin?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ARC.</speaker>
<line offset="5">How do you, sir?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAL.</speaker>
<line>Why, strong enough to laugh at misery</line>
<line>And bear the chance of war yet. We are prisoners</line>
<line>I fear forever, cousin.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ARC.</speaker>
<line offset="5">I believe it,</line>
<line>And to that destiny have patiently</line>
<line>Laid up my hour to come.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAL.</speaker>
<line offset="6">O cousin Arcite,</line>
<line>Where is Thebes now? Where is our noble country?</line>
<line>Where are our friends and kindreds? Never more</line>
<line>Must we behold those comforts, never see</line>
<line>The hardy youths strive for the games of honor,</line>
<line>Hung with the painted favors of their ladies,</line>
<line>Like tall ships under sail; then start amongst &#8217;em</line>
<line>And as an east wind leave &#8217;em all behind us,</line>
<line>Like lazy clouds, whilst Palamon and Arcite,</line>
<line>Even in the wagging of a wanton leg,</line>
<line>Outstripp&#8217;d the people&#8217;s praises, won the garlands,</line>
<line>Ere they have time to wish &#8217;em ours. O, never</line>
<line>Shall we two exercise, like twins of honor,</line>
<line>Our arms again, and feel our fiery horses</line>
<line>Like proud seas under us. Our good swords now</line>
<line>(Better the red-ey&#8217;d god of war nev&#8217;r ware),</line>
<line>Ravish&#8217;d our sides, like age must run to rust,</line>
<line>And deck the temples of those gods that hate us;</line>
<line>These hands shall never draw &#8217;em out like lightning</line>
<line>To blast whole armies more.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ARC.</speaker>
<line offset="6">No, Palamon,</line>
<line>Those hopes are prisoners with us. Here we are,</line>
<line>And here the graces of our youths must wither</line>
<line>Like a too-timely spring. Here age must find us,</line>
<line>And which is heaviest, Palamon, unmarried.</line>
<line>The sweet embraces of a loving wife,</line>
<line>Loaden with kisses, arm&#8217;d with thousand Cupids,</line>
<line>Shall never clasp our necks; no issue know us;</line>
<line>No figures of ourselves shall we ev&#8217;r see</line>
<line>To glad our age, and like young eagles teach &#8217;em</line>
<line>Boldly to gaze against bright arms, and say,</line>
<line>&#8220;Remember what your fathers were, and conquer!&#8221;</line>
<line>The fair-ey&#8217;d maids shall weep our banishments,</line>
<line>And in their songs curse ever-blinded Fortune</line>
<line>Till she for shame see what a wrong she has done</line>
<line>To youth and nature. This is all our world:</line>
<line>We shall know nothing here but one another,</line>
<line>Hear nothing but the clock that tells our woes;</line>
<line>The vine shall grow, but we shall never see it;</line>
<line>Summer shall come, and with her all delights,</line>
<line>But dead-cold winter must inhabit here still.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAL.</speaker>
<line>&#8217;Tis too true, Arcite. To our Theban hounds,</line>
<line>That shook the aged forest with their echoes,</line>
<line>No more now must we hallow; no more shake</line>
<line>Our pointed javelins, whilst the angry swine</line>
<line>Flies like a Parthian quiver from our rages,</line>
<line>Struck with our well-steel&#8217;d darts. All valiant uses</line>
<line>(The food and nourishment of noble minds)</line>
<line>In us two here shall perish; we shall die</line>
<line>(Which is the curse of honor) lastly</line>
<line>Children of grief and ignorance.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ARC.</speaker>
<line offset="7">Yet, cousin,</line>
<line>Even from the bottom of these miseries,</line>
<line>From all that fortune can inflict upon us,</line>
<line>I see two comforts rising, two mere blessings,</line>
<line>If the gods please&#8212;to hold here a brave patience,</line>
<line>And the enjoying of our griefs together.</line>
<line>Whilst Palamon is with me, let me perish</line>
<line>If I think this our prison.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAL.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Certainly</line>
<line>&#8217;Tis a main goodness, cousin, that our fortunes</line>
<line>Were twin&#8217;d together. &#8217;Tis most true, two souls</line>
<line>Put in two noble bodies, let &#8217;em suffer</line>
<line>The gall of hazard, so they grow together,</line>
<line>Will never sink; they must not, say they could;</line>
<line>A willing man dies sleeping, and all&#8217;s done.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ARC.</speaker>
<line>Shall we make worthy uses of this place</line>
<line>That all men hate so much?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAL.</speaker>
<line offset="6">How, gentle cousin?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ARC.</speaker>
<line>Let&#8217;s think this prison holy sanctuary</line>
<line>To keep us from corruption of worse men.</line>
<line>We are young and yet desire the ways of honor,</line>
<line>That liberty and common conversation,</line>
<line>The poison of pure spirits, might, like women,</line>
<line>Woo us to wander from. What worthy blessing</line>
<line>Can be, but our imaginations</line>
<line>May make it ours? And here being thus together,</line>
<line>We are an endless mine to one another;</line>
<line>We are one another&#8217;s wife, ever begetting</line>
<line>New births of love; we are father, friends, acquaintance;</line>
<line>We are, in one another, families:</line>
<line>I am your heir, and you are mine; this place</line>
<line>Is our inheritance. No hard oppressor</line>
<line>Dare take this from us; here with a little patience</line>
<line>We shall live long, and loving. No surfeits seek us;</line>
<line>The hand of war hurts none here, nor the seas</line>
<line>Swallow their youth. Were we at liberty,</line>
<line>A wife might part us lawfully, or business,</line>
<line>Quarrels consume us, envy of ill men</line>
<line>Crave our acquaintance; I might sicken, cousin,</line>
<line>Where you should never know it, and so perish</line>
<line>Without your noble hand to close mine eyes,</line>
<line>Or prayers to the gods. A thousand chances,</line>
<line>Were we from hence, would sever us.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAL.</speaker>
<line offset="8">You have made me</line>
<line>(I thank you, cousin Arcite) almost wanton</line>
<line>With my captivity. What a misery</line>
<line>It is to live abroad, and every where!</line>
<line>&#8217;Tis like a beast, methinks. I find the court here,</line>
<line>I am sure, a more content, and all those pleasures</line>
<line>That woo the wills of men to vanity</line>
<line>I see through now, and am sufficient</line>
<line>To tell the world &#8217;tis but a gaudy shadow</line>
<line>That old Time, as he passes by, takes with him.</line>
<line>What had we been, old in the court of Creon,</line>
<line>Where sin is justice, lust and ignorance</line>
<line>The virtues of the great ones? Cousin Arcite,</line>
<line>Had not the loving gods found this place for us,</line>
<line>We had died as they do, ill old men, unwept,</line>
<line>And had their epitaphs, the people&#8217;s curses.</line>
<line>Shall I say more?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ARC.</speaker>
<line offset="4">I would hear you still.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAL.</speaker>
<line offset="8">Ye shall.</line>
<line>Is there record of any two that lov&#8217;d</line>
<line>Better than we do, Arcite?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ARC.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Sure there cannot.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAL.</speaker>
<line>I do not think it possible our friendship</line>
<line>Should ever leave us.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ARC.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Till our deaths it cannot,</line>

<stagedir>Enter Emilia and her Woman below.</stagedir>

<line>And after death our spirits shall be led</line>
<line>To those that love eternally. Speak on, sir.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>EMIL.</speaker>
<line>This garden has a world of pleasures in&#8217;t.</line>
<line>What flow&#8217;r is this?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WOMAN.</speaker>
<line offset="4">&#8217;Tis call&#8217;d narcissus, madam.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>EMIL.</speaker>
<line>That was a fair boy certain, but a fool</line>
<line>To love himself. Were there not maids enough?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ARC.</speaker>
<line>Pray forward.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAL.</speaker>
<line offset="3">Yes.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>EMIL.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Or were they all hard-hearted?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WOMAN.</speaker>
<line>They could not be to one so fair.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>EMIL.</speaker>
<line offset="7">Thou wouldst not.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WOMAN.</speaker>
<line>I think I should not, madam.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>EMIL.</speaker>
<line offset="6">That&#8217;s a good wench!</line>
<line>But take heed to your kindness though.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WOMAN.</speaker>
<line offset="8">Why, madam?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>EMIL.</speaker>
<line>Men are mad things.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ARC.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Will ye go forward, cousin?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>EMIL.</speaker>
<line>Canst not thou work such flowers in silk, wench?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WOMAN.</speaker>
<line offset="9">Yes.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>EMIL.</speaker>
<line>I&#8217;ll have a gown full of &#8217;em, and of these:</line>
<line>This is a pretty color, will&#8217;t not do</line>
<line>Rarely upon a skirt, wench?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WOMAN.</speaker>
<line offset="6">Dainty, madam.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ARC.</speaker>
<line>Cousin, cousin, how do you, sir? Why, Palamon!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAL.</speaker>
<line>Never till now I was in prison, Arcite.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ARC.</speaker>
<line>Why, what&#8217;s the matter, man?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAL.</speaker>
<line offset="6">Behold, and wonder!</line>
<line>By heaven, she is a goddess.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ARC.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Ha!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAL.</speaker>
<line offset="7">Do reverence;</line>
<line>She is a goddess, Arcite.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>EMIL.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Of all flow&#8217;rs</line>
<line>Methinks a rose is best.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WOMAN.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Why, gentle madam?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>EMIL.</speaker>
<line>It is the very emblem of a maid;</line>
<line>For when the west wind courts her gently,</line>
<line>How modestly she blows, and paints the sun</line>
<line>With her chaste blushes! When the north comes near her,</line>
<line>Rude and impatient, then, like chastity,</line>
<line>She locks her beauties in her bud again,</line>
<line>And leaves him to base briers.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WOMAN.</speaker>
<line offset="6">Yet, good madam,</line>
<line>Sometimes her modesty will blow so far she falls for&#8217;t.</line>
<line>A maid, if she have any honor, would be loath</line>
<line>To take example by her.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>EMIL.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Thou art wanton.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ARC.</speaker>
<line>She is wondrous fair.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAL.</speaker>
<line offset="4">She is all the beauty extant.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>EMIL.</speaker>
<line>The sun grows high, let&#8217;s walk in. Keep these flowers,</line>
<line>We&#8217;ll see how near art can come near their colors.</line>
<line>I am wondrous merry-hearted, I could laugh now.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WOMAN.</speaker>
<line>I could lie down, I am sure.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>EMIL.</speaker>
<line offset="5">And take one with you?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WOMAN.</speaker>
<line>That&#8217;s as we bargain, madam.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>EMIL.</speaker>
<line offset="6">Well, agree then.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exeunt Emilia and Woman.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>PAL.</speaker>
<line>What think you of this beauty?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ARC.</speaker>
<line offset="7">&#8217;Tis a rare one.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAL.</speaker>
<line>Is&#8217;t but a rare one?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ARC.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Yes, a matchless beauty.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAL.</speaker>
<line>Might not a man well lose himself and love her?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ARC.</speaker>
<line>I cannot tell what you have done; I have,</line>
<line>Beshrew mine eyes for&#8217;t! Now I feel my shackles.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAL.</speaker>
<line>You love her then?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ARC.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Who would not?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAL.</speaker>
<line offset="8">And desire her?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ARC.</speaker>
<line>Before my liberty.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAL.</speaker>
<line>I saw her first.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ARC.</speaker>
<line offset="3">That&#8217;s nothing.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAL.</speaker>
<line offset="7">But it shall be.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ARC.</speaker>
<line>I saw her too.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAL.</speaker>
<line offset="3">Yes, but you must not love her.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ARC.</speaker>
<line>I will not, as you do&#8212;to worship her</line>
<line>As she is heavenly and a blessed goddess;</line>
<line>I love her as a woman, to enjoy her.</line>
<line>So both may love.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAL.</speaker>
<line offset="4">You shall not love at all.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ARC.</speaker>
<line>Not love at all! Who shall deny me?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAL.</speaker>
<line>I, that first saw her; I, that took possession</line>
<line>First with mine eye of all those beauties in her</line>
<line>Reveal&#8217;d to mankind. If thou lov&#8217;st her,</line>
<line>Or entertain&#8217;st a hope to blast my wishes,</line>
<line>Thou art a traitor, Arcite, and a fellow</line>
<line>False as thy title to her. Friendship, blood,</line>
<line>And all the ties between us, I disclaim</line>
<line>If thou once think upon her.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ARC.</speaker>
<line offset="6">Yes, I love her,</line>
<line>And if the lives of all my name lay on it,</line>
<line>I must do so; I love her with my soul;</line>
<line>If that will lose ye, farewell, Palamon.</line>
<line>I say again, I love, and in loving her maintain</line>
<line>I am as worthy and as free a lover,</line>
<line>And have as just a title to her beauty,</line>
<line>As any Palamon or any living</line>
<line>That is a man&#8217;s son.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAL.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Have I call&#8217;d thee friend?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ARC.</speaker>
<line>Yes, and have found me so. Why are you mov&#8217;d thus?</line>
<line>Let me deal coldly with you: am not I</line>
<line>Part of your blood, part of your soul? You have told me</line>
<line>That I was Palamon, and you were Arcite.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAL.</speaker>
<line offset="9">Yes.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ARC.</speaker>
<line>Am not I liable to those affections,</line>
<line>Those joys, griefs, angers, fears, my friend shall suffer?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAL.</speaker>
<line>Ye may be.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ARC.</speaker>
<line offset="3">Why then would you deal so cunningly,</line>
<line>So strangely, so unlike a noble kinsman,</line>
<line>To love alone? Speak truly: do you think me</line>
<line>Unworthy of her sight?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAL.</speaker>
<line offset="5">No; but unjust</line>
<line>If thou pursue that sight.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ARC.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Because another</line>
<line>First sees the enemy, shall I stand still,</line>
<line>And let mine honor down, and never charge?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAL.</speaker>
<line>Yes, if he be but one.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ARC.</speaker>
<line offset="5">But say that one</line>
<line>Had rather combat me?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAL.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Let that one say so,</line>
<line>And use thy freedom; else, if thou pursuest her,</line>
<line>Be as that cursed man that hates his country,</line>
<line>A branded villain.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ARC.</speaker>
<line offset="4">You are mad.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAL.</speaker>
<line offset="7">I must be&#8212;</line>
<line>Till thou art worthy, Arcite, it concerns me,</line>
<line>And in this madness if I hazard thee</line>
<line>And take thy life, I deal but truly.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ARC.</speaker>
<line offset="7">Fie, sir!</line>
<line>You play the child extremely. I will love her,</line>
<line>I must, I ought to do so, and I dare&#8212;</line>
<line>And all this justly.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAL.</speaker>
<line offset="4">O that now, that now</line>
<line>Thy false-self and thy friend had but this fortune</line>
<line>To be one hour at liberty, and grasp</line>
<line>Our good swords in our hands, I would quickly teach thee</line>
<line>What &#8217;twere to filch affection from another!</line>
<line>Thou art baser in it than a cutpurse.</line>
<line>Put but thy head out of this window more,</line>
<line>And as I have a soul, I&#8217;ll nail thy life to&#8217;t!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ARC.</speaker>
<line>Thou dar&#8217;st not, fool, thou canst not, thou art feeble.</line>
<line>Put my head out? I&#8217;ll throw my body out,</line>
<line>And leap the garden, when I see her next,</line>
<line>And pitch between her arms to anger thee.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Jailer above.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>PAL.</speaker>
<line>No more; the keeper&#8217;s coming. I shall live</line>
<line>To knock thy brains out with my shackles.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ARC.</speaker>
<line offset="9">Do.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JAIL.</speaker>
<line>By your leave, gentlemen.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAL.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Now, honest keeper?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JAIL.</speaker>
<line>Lord Arcite, you must presently to th&#8217; Duke;</line>
<line>The cause I know not yet.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ARC.</speaker>
<line offset="5">I am ready, keeper.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JAIL.</speaker>
<line>Prince Palamon, I must awhile bereave you</line>
<line>Of your fair cousin&#8217;s company.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exeunt Arcite and Jailer.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>PAL.</speaker>
<line offset="7">And me too,</line>
<line>Even when you please, of life. Why is he sent for?</line>
<line>It may be he shall marry her; he&#8217;s goodly,</line>
<line>And like enough the Duke hath taken notice</line>
<line>Both of his blood and body. But his falsehood!</line>
<line>Why should a friend be treacherous? If that</line>
<line>Get him a wife so noble and so fair,</line>
<line>Let honest men ne&#8217;er love again. Once more</line>
<line>I would but see this fair one. Blessed garden,</line>
<line>And fruit and flowers more blessed, that still blossom</line>
<line>As her bright eyes shine on ye, would I were,</line>
<line>For all the fortune of my life hereafter,</line>
<line>Yon little tree, yon blooming apricock!</line>
<line>How I would spread, and fling my wanton arms</line>
<line>In at her window! I would bring her fruit</line>
<line>Fit for the gods to feed on; youth and pleasure,</line>
<line>Still as she tasted, should be doubled on her,</line>
<line>And if she be not heavenly, I would make her</line>
<line>So near the gods in nature, they should fear her;</line>
<line>And then I am sure she would love me.</line>

<stagedir>Enter Jailer above.</stagedir>

<line offset="8">How now, keeper,</line>
<line>Where&#8217;s Arcite?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JAIL.</speaker>
<line offset="3">Banish&#8217;d. Prince Pirithous</line>
<line>Obtained his liberty; but never more,</line>
<line>Upon his oath and life, must he set foot</line>
<line>Upon this kingdom.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAL.</speaker> 
<stagedir>Aside.</stagedir>
<line offset="4">He&#8217;s a blessed man!</line>
<line>He shall see Thebes again, and call to arms</line>
<line>The bold young men that when he bids &#8217;em charge,</line>
<line>Fall on like fire. Arcite shall have a fortune,</line>
<line>If he dare make himself a worthy lover,</line>
<line>Yet in the field to strike a battle for her;</line>
<line>And if he lose her then, he&#8217;s a cold coward.</line>
<line>How bravely may he bear himself to win her,</line>
<line>If he be noble Arcite&#8212;thousand ways!</line>
<line>Were I at liberty, I would do things</line>
<line>Of such a virtuous greatness that this lady,</line>
<line>This blushing virgin, should take manhood to her</line>
<line>And seek to ravish me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JAIL.</speaker>
<line offset="5">My lord, for you</line>
<line>I have this charge too&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAL.</speaker>
<line offset="4">To discharge my life?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JAIL.</speaker>
<line>No, but from this place to remove your lordship;</line>
<line>The windows are too open.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAL.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Devils take &#8217;em</line>
<line>That are so envious to me! Prithee kill me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JAIL.</speaker>
<line>And hang for&#8217;t afterward!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAL.</speaker>
<line offset="5">By this good light,</line>
<line>Had I a sword, I would kill thee.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JAIL.</speaker>
<line offset="7">Why, my lord?</line>
</speech>

<speech>

<line>Why should I love this gentleman? &#8217;Tis odds</line>

<line>My father the mean keeper of his prison,</line>

<line>To be his whore is witless. Out upon&#8217;t!</line>
<line>What pushes are we wenches driven to</line>
<line>When fifteen once has found us! First, I saw him:</line>
<line>I, seeing, thought he was a goodly man;</line>
<line>He has as much to please a woman in him</line>
<line>(If he please to bestow it so) as ever</line>
<line>These eyes yet look&#8217;d on. Next, I pitied him;</line>
<line>And so would any young wench o&#8217; my conscience</line>

<line>To a young handsome man. Then, I lov&#8217;d him,</line>
<line>Extremely lov&#8217;d him, infinitely lov&#8217;d him;</line>

<line>But in my heart was Palamon, and there,</line>
<line>Lord, what a coil he keeps! To hear him</line>
<line>Sing in an evening, what a heaven it is!</line>
<line>And yet his songs are sad ones. Fairer spoken</line>
<line>Was never gentleman. When I come in</line>
<line>To bring him water in a morning, first</line>
<line>He bows his noble body, then salutes me thus:</line>
<line>&#8220;Fair gentle maid, good morrow. May thy goodness</line>
<line>Get thee a happy husband!&#8221; Once he kiss&#8217;d me&#8212;</line>
<line>I lov&#8217;d my lips the better ten days after.</line>

<line>And me as much to see his misery.</line>
<line>What should I do to make him know I love him,</line>
<line>For I would fain enjoy him? Say I ventur&#8217;d</line>

<line>Void of appointment, that thou li&#8217;st, and art</line>

<line>No matter, would it were perpetual night,</line>
<line>And darkness lord o&#8217; th&#8217; world! Hark, &#8217;tis a wolf!</line>
<line>In me hath grief slain fear, and but for one thing,</line>
<line>I care for nothing, and that&#8217;s Palamon.</line>
<line>I reck not if the wolves would jaw me, so</line>
<line>He had this file. What if I hallow&#8217;d for him?</line>
<line>I cannot hallow. If I whoop&#8217;d, what then?</line>
<line>If he not answer&#8217;d, I should call a wolf,</line>

<line>Strange howls this livelong night; why may&#8217;t not be</line>
<line>They have made prey of him? He has no weapons,</line>
<line>He cannot run, the jingling of his gyves</line>
<line>Might call fell things to listen, who have in them</line>
<line>A sense to know a man unarm&#8217;d, and can</line>
<line>Smell where resistance is. I&#8217;ll set it down</line>
<line>He&#8217;s torn to pieces. They howl&#8217;d many together,</line>
<line>And then they fed on him. So much for that,</line>
<line>Be bold to ring the bell. How stand I then?</line>

<line>Lest I should drown, or stab, or hang myself.</line>
<line>O state of nature, fail together in me,</line>
<line>Since thy best props are warp&#8217;d! So which way now?</line>

<line>About this hour my cousin gave his faith</line>
<line>To visit me again, and with him bring</line>
<line>Two swords and two good armors. If he fail,</line>
<line>He&#8217;s neither man nor soldier. When he left me,</line>
<line>I did not think a week could have restor&#8217;d</line>
<line>My lost strength to me, I was grown so low</line>
<line>And crestfall&#8217;n with my wants. I thank thee, Arcite,</line>
<line>Thou art yet a fair foe; and I feel myself,</line>
<line>With this refreshing, able once again</line>
<line>To out-dure danger. To delay it longer</line>
<line>Would make the world think, when it comes to hearing,</line>
<line>That I lay fatting like a swine, to fight,</line>
<line>And not a soldier: therefore this blest morning</line>
<line>Shall be the last; and that sword he refuses,</line>
<line>If it but hold, I kill him with. &#8217;Tis justice.</line>
<line>So, love and fortune for me!</line>

<line>Would you were so in all, sir! I could wish ye</line>

<line>Defy me in these fair terms, and you show</line>
<line>More than a mistress to me; no more anger,</line>
<line>As you love any thing that&#8217;s honorable.</line>
<line>We were not bred to talk, man. When we are arm&#8217;d</line>
<line>And both upon our guards, then let our fury,</line>
<line>Like meeting of two tides, fly strongly from us,</line>
<line>And then to whom the birthright of this beauty</line>
<line>Truly pertains (without obbraidings, scorns,</line>
<line>Despisings of our persons, and such poutings,</line>
<line>Fitter for girls and schoolboys) will be seen,</line>
<line>And quickly, yours or mine. Will&#8217;t please you arm, sir?</line>
<line>Or if you feel yourself not fitting yet</line>
<line>And furnish&#8217;d with your old strength, I&#8217;ll stay, cousin,</line>
<line>And ev&#8217;ry day discourse you into health,</line>
<line>As I am spar&#8217;d. Your person I am friends with,</line>
<line>And I could wish I had not said I lov&#8217;d her,</line>

<line>Thou wor&#8217;st that day the three kings fell, but lighter.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ARC.</speaker>
<line>That was a very good one, and that day,</line>
<line>I well remember, you outdid me, cousin;</line>
<line>I never saw such valor. When you charg&#8217;d</line>
<line>Upon the left wing of the enemy,</line>
<line>I spurr&#8217;d hard to come up, and under me</line>
<line>I had a right good horse.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>PAL.</speaker>
<line offset="5">You had indeed,</line>
<line>A bright bay, I remember.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ARC.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Yes, but all</line>
<line>Was vainly labor&#8217;d in me; you outwent me,</line>
<line>Nor could my wishes reach you. Yet a little</line>
<line>I did by imitation.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAL.</speaker>
<line offset="4">More by virtue.</line>
<line>You are modest, cousin.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ARC.</speaker>

<line>Methought I heard a dreadful clap of thunder</line>
<line>Break from the troop.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAL.</speaker>
<line offset="4">But still before that flew</line>
<line>The lightning of your valor. Stay a little;</line>
<line>Is not this piece too strait?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ARC.</speaker>
<line offset="5">No, no, &#8217;tis well.</line>
</speech>

<speech>

<line>In me, thine, and in thee, mine. My sword</line>
<line>Is in my hand, and if thou kill&#8217;st me,</line>
<line>The gods and I forgive thee. If there be</line>
<line>A place prepar&#8217;d for those that sleep in honor,</line>
<line>I wish his weary soul that falls may win it.</line>
<line>Fight bravely, cousin. Give me thy noble hand.</line>

<line offset="5">No, no, cousin,</line>
<line>I will no more be hidden, nor put off</line>
<line>This great adventure to a second trial.</line>
<line>I know your cunning, and I know your cause.</line>
<line>He that faints now, shame take him! Put thyself</line>

<speaker>PAL.</speaker>
<line>Or I will make th&#8217; advantage of this hour</line>
<line>Mine own; and what to come shall threaten me</line>
<line>I fear less than my fortune. Know, weak cousin,</line>
<line>I love Emilia, and in that I&#8217;ll bury</line>
<line>Thee and all crosses else.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ARC.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Then come what can come,</line>
<line>Thou shalt know, Palamon, I dare as well</line>
<line>Die as discourse or sleep. Only this fears me,</line>
<line>The law will have the honor of our ends.</line>
<line>Have at thy life!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAL.</speaker>
<line offset="3">Look to thine own well, Arcite.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Fight again. Horns.</stagedir>

<stagedir>Enter Theseus, Hippolyta, Emilia, Pirithous, and Train.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>THE.</speaker>
<line>What ignorant and mad malicious traitors</line>
<line>Are you, that &#8217;gainst the tenor of my laws</line>
<line>Are making battle, thus like knights appointed,</line>
<line>Without my leave and officers of arms?</line>
<line>By Castor, both shall die.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAL.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Hold thy word, Theseus.</line>
<line>We are certainly both traitors, both despisers</line>
<line>Of thee and of thy goodness. I am Palamon,</line>
<line>That cannot love thee, he that broke thy prison&#8212;</line>
<line>Think well what that deserves; and this is Arcite,</line>
<line>A bolder traitor never trod thy ground,</line>
<line>A falser nev&#8217;r seem&#8217;d friend. This is the man</line>
<line>Was begg&#8217;d and banish&#8217;d, this is he contemns thee</line>
<line>And what thou dar&#8217;st do; and in this disguise,</line>
<line>Against thy own edict, follows thy sister,</line>
<line>That fortunate bright star, the fair Emilia,</line>
<line>Whose servant (if there be a right in seeing,</line>
<line>And first bequeathing of the soul to) justly</line>
<line>I am, and which is more, dares think her his.</line>
<line>This treachery, like a most trusty lover,</line>
<line>I call&#8217;d him now to answer. If thou be&#8217;st,</line>
<line>As thou art spoken, great and virtuous,</line>
<line>The true decider of all injuries,</line>
<line>Say, &#8220;Fight again!&#8221; and thou shalt see me, Theseus,</line>
<line>Do such a justice thou thyself wilt envy.</line>
<line>Then take my life, I&#8217;ll woo thee to&#8217;t.</line>

<line offset="7">O heaven,</line>
<line>What more than man is this!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>THE.</speaker>
<line offset="6">I have sworn.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ARC.</speaker>
<line offset="9">We seek not</line>
<line>Thy breath of mercy, Theseus. &#8217;Tis to me</line>
<line>A thing as soon to die as thee to say it,</line>
<line>And no more mov&#8217;d. Where this man calls me traitor,</line>
<line>Let me say thus much: if in love be treason</line>
<line>In service of so excellent a beauty,</line>
<line>As I love most, and in that faith will perish,</line>
<line>As I have brought my life here to confirm it,</line>
<line>As I have serv&#8217;d her truest, worthiest,</line>
<line>As I dare kill this cousin that denies it,</line>
<line>So let me be most traitor, and ye please me.</line>
<line>For scorning thy edict, Duke, ask that lady</line>
<line>Why she is fair, and why her eyes command me</line>
<line>Stay here to love her; and if she say &#8220;traitor,&#8221;</line>
<line>I am a villain fit to lie unburied.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAL.</speaker>
<line>Thou shalt have pity of us both, O Theseus,</line>
<line>If unto neither thou show mercy. Stop,</line>
<line>As thou art just, thy noble ear against us;</line>
<line>As thou art valiant, for thy cousin&#8217;s soul,</line>
<line>Whose twelve strong labors crown his memory,</line>
<line>Let &#8217;s die together, at one instant, Duke.</line>
<line>Only a little let him fall before me,</line>
<line>That I may tell my soul he shall not have her.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>THE.</speaker>
<line>I grant your wish, for to say true, your cousin</line>
<line>Has ten times more offended, for I gave him</line>
<line>More mercy than you found, sir, your offenses</line>
<line>Being no more than his. None here speak for &#8217;em,</line>
<line>For ere the sun set, both shall sleep forever.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HIP.</speaker>
<line>Alas, the pity! Now or never, sister,</line>
<line>Speak, not to be denied. That face of yours</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>EMIL.</speaker>
<line offset="5">In my face, dear sister,</line>
<line>I find no anger to &#8217;em, nor no ruin:</line>
<line>The misadventure of their own eyes kill &#8217;em;</line>
<line>Yet that I will be woman, and have pity,</line>
<line>My knees shall grow to th&#8217; ground but I&#8217;ll get mercy.</line>
<line>Help me, dear sister, in a deed so virtuous</line>
<line>The powers of all women will be with us.</line>
<line>Most royal brother&#8212;</line>

<line offset="7">By valor,</line>
<line>By all the chaste nights I have ever pleas&#8217;d you&#8212;</line>

<line offset="6">Nay then I&#8217;ll in too.</line>

<stagedir>Kneels.</stagedir>
<line>By all our friendship, sir, by all our dangers,</line>
<line>By all you love most&#8212;wars, and this sweet lady&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>

<line>By that you would have trembled to deny</line>

<speaker>HIP.</speaker>
<line offset="4">By your own eyes, by strength,</line>
<line>In which you swore I went beyond all women,</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PIR.</speaker>
<line>To crown all this, by your most noble soul,</line>

<speech>
<speaker>EMIL.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Mercy on these princes.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>THE.</speaker>
<line>Ye make my faith reel. Say I felt</line>
<line>Compassion to &#8217;em both, how would you place it?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>EMIL.</speaker>
<line>Upon their lives; but with their banishments.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>THE.</speaker>
<line>You are a right woman, sister, you have pity,</line>
<line>But want the understanding where to use it.</line>
<line>If you desire their lives, invent a way</line>
<line>Safer than banishment. Can these two live,</line>
<line>And have the agony of love about &#8217;em,</line>
<line>And not kill one another? Every day</line>
<line>They&#8217;ld fight about you; hourly bring your honor</line>
<line>In public question with their swords. Be wise then</line>
<line>And here forget &#8217;em; it concerns your credit</line>
<line>And my oath equally. I have said they die;</line>
<line>Better they fall by th&#8217; law than one another.</line>
<line>Bow not my honor.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>EMIL.</speaker>
<line offset="4">O my noble brother,</line>
<line>That oath was rashly made, and in your anger,</line>
<line>Your reason will not hold it. If such vows</line>
<line>Stand for express will, all the world must perish.</line>
<line>Beside, I have another oath &#8217;gainst yours,</line>
<line>Of more authority, I am sure more love,</line>
<line>Not made in passion neither, but good heed.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>THE.</speaker>
<line>What is it, sister?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PIR.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Urge it home, brave lady.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>EMIL.</speaker>
<line>That you would nev&#8217;r deny me any thing</line>
<line>Fit for my modest suit and your free granting.</line>
<line>I tie you to your word now; if ye fall in&#8217;t,</line>
<line>Think how you maim your honor</line>
<line>(For now I am set a-begging, sir, I am deaf</line>
<line>To all but your compassion), how their lives</line>
<line>Might breed the ruin of my name; opinion,</line>
<line>Shall any thing that loves me perish for me?</line>
<line>That were a cruel wisdom. Do men proin</line>
<line>The straight young boughs that blush with thousand blossoms,</line>
<line>Because they may be rotten? O Duke Theseus,</line>
<line>The goodly mothers that have groan&#8217;d for these,</line>
<line>And all the longing maids that ever lov&#8217;d,</line>
<line>If your vow stand, shall curse me and my beauty,</line>
<line>And in their funeral songs for these two cousins</line>
<line>Despise my cruelty, and cry woe worth me,</line>
<line>Till I am nothing but the scorn of women.</line>
<line>For heaven&#8217;s sake save their lives, and banish &#8217;em.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>THE.</speaker>
<line>On what conditions?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>EMIL.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Swear &#8217;em never more</line>
<line>To make me their contention, or to know me,</line>
<line>To tread upon thy dukedom, and to be,</line>
<line>Where ever they shall travel, ever strangers</line>
<line>To one another.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAL.</speaker>
<line offset="4">I&#8217;ll be cut a-pieces</line>
<line>Before I take this oath. Forget I love her?</line>
<line>O all ye gods, despise me then. Thy banishment</line>
<line>I not mislike, so we may fairly carry</line>
<line>Our swords and cause along; else, never trifle,</line>
<line>But take our lives, Duke. I must love, and will,</line>
<line>And for that love must and dare kill this cousin,</line>
<line>On any piece the earth has.</line>
</speech>

<line offset="5">Will you, Arcite,</line>
<line>Take these conditions?</line>

<line>These are men!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ARC.</speaker>
<line>No, never. Duke. &#8217;Tis worse to me than begging</line>
<line>To take my life so basely. Though I think</line>
<line>I never shall enjoy her, yet I&#8217;ll preserve</line>
<line>The honor of affection, and die for her,</line>
<line>Make death a devil.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>THE.</speaker>
<line>What may be done? For now I feel compassion.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PIR.</speaker>
<line>Let it not fall again, sir.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>THE.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Say, Emilia,</line>
<line>If one of them were dead, as one must, are you</line>
<line>Content to take th&#8217; other to your husband?</line>
<line>They cannot both enjoy you. They are princes</line>
<line>As goodly as your own eyes, and as noble</line>
<line>As ever fame yet spoke of. Look upon &#8217;em</line>
<line>And if you can love, end this difference.</line>
<line>I give consent.&#8212;Are you content too, princes?</line>

<speech>
<speaker>BOTH. ARC. AND PAL.</speaker>
<line>With all our souls.</line>

<line>If I fall from that mouth, I fall with favor,</line>

<line>If she refuse me, yet my grave will wed me,</line>
<line>And soldiers sing my epitaph.</line>
</speech>

<speech>

<line offset="6">Make choice then.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>EMIL.</speaker>
<line>I cannot, sir, they are both too excellent:</line>
<line>For me, a hair shall never fall of these men.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HIP.</speaker>
<line>What will become of &#8217;em?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>THE.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Thus I ordain it,</line>
<line>And by mine honor, once again it stands,</line>
<line>Or both shall die: you shall both to your country,</line>
<line>And each within this month, accompanied</line>
<line>With three fair knights, appear again in this place,</line>
<line>In which I&#8217;ll plant a pyramid; and whether,</line>
<line>Before us that are here, can force his cousin</line>
<line>By fair and knightly strength to touch the pillar,</line>
<line>He shall enjoy her; the other lose his head,</line>
<line>And all his friends; nor shall he grudge to fall,</line>
<line>Nor think he dies with interest in this lady.</line>
<line>Will this content ye?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAL.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Yes. Here, cousin Arcite,</line>
<line>I am friends again till that hour.</line>

<line>I do not think she was very well, for, now</line>
<line>You make me mind her, but this very day</line>
<line>I ask&#8217;d her questions, and she answered me</line>
<line>So far from what she was, so childishly,</line>
<line>So sillily, as if she were a fool,</line>
<line>An innocent, and I was very angry.</line>
<line>But what of her, sir?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WOOER.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Nothing but my pity.</line>
<line>But you must know it, and as good by me</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JAIL.</speaker>
<line offset="5">I half suspected</line>
<line>What you told me. The gods comfort her!</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WOOER.</speaker>
<line>I&#8217;ll tell you quickly. As I late was angling</line>
<line>In the great lake that lies behind the palace,</line>
<line>From the far shore, thick set with reeds and sedges,</line>
<line>As patiently I was attending sport,</line>
<line>I heard a voice, a shrill one; and attentive</line>
<line>I gave my ear, when I might well perceive</line>
<line>&#8217;Twas one that sung, and by the smallness of it,</line>
<line>A boy or woman. I then left my angle</line>
<line>To his own skill, came near, but yet perceiv&#8217;d not</line>
<line>Who made the sound, the rushes and the reeds</line>
<line>Had so encompass&#8217;d it. I laid me down</line>
<line>And list&#8217;ned to the words she sung, for then</line>
<line>Through a small glade cut by the fishermen,</line>
<line>I saw it was your daughter.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JAIL.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Pray go on, sir.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WOOER.</speaker>
<line>She sung much, but no sense; only I heard her</line>
<line>Repeat this often, &#8220;Palamon is gone,</line>
<line>Is gone to th&#8217; wood to gather mulberries.</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll find him out tomorrow.&#8221;</line>

<line>With cherry lips and cheeks of damask roses,</line>
<line>And all we&#8217;ll dance an antic &#8217;fore the Duke,</line>
<line>And beg his pardon.&#8221; Then she talk&#8217;d of you, sir:</line>
<line>That you must lose your head tomorrow morning,</line>
<line>And she must gather flowers to bury you,</line>
<line>And see the house made handsome. Then she sung</line>
<line>Nothing but &#8220;Willow, willow, willow,&#8221; and between</line>
<line>Ever was &#8220;Palamon, fair Palamon,&#8221;</line>
<line>And &#8220;Palamon was a tall young man.&#8221; The place</line>
<line>Was knee-deep where she sat; her careless tresses</line>
<line>A wreath of bulrush rounded; about her stuck</line>
<line>Thousand fresh water-flowers of several colors,</line>
<line>That methought she appear&#8217;d like the fair nymph</line>
<line>That feeds the lake with waters, or as Iris</line>
<line>Newly dropp&#8217;d down from heaven. Rings she made</line>
<line>Of rushes that grew by, and to &#8217;em spoke</line>
<line>The prettiest posies&#8212;&#8220;Thus our true love&#8217;s tied,&#8221;</line>
<line>&#8220;This you may loose, not me,&#8221; and many a one;</line>
<line>And then she wept, and sung again, and sigh&#8217;d,</line>
<line>And with the same breath smil&#8217;d, and kiss&#8217;d her hand.</line>

<line>With such a cry and swiftness that, believe me,</line>

<speaker>EMIL.</speaker>
<line>Yet I may bind those wounds up, that must open</line>
<line>And bleed to death for my sake else. I&#8217;ll choose,</line>
<line>And end their strife. Two such young handsome men</line>
<line>Shall never fall for me; their weeping mothers,</line>
<line>Following the dead-cold ashes of their sons,</line>
<line>Shall never curse my cruelty. Good heaven,</line>
<line>What a sweet face has Arcite! If wise Nature,</line>
<line>With all her best endowments, all those beauties</line>
<line>She sows into the births of noble bodies,</line>
<line>Were here a mortal woman, and had in her</line>
<line>The coy denials of young maids, yet doubtless</line>
<line>She would run mad for this man. What an eye,</line>
<line>Of what a fiery sparkle and quick sweetness,</line>
<line>Has this young prince! Here Love himself sits smiling.</line>
<line>Just such another wanton Ganymede</line>
<line>Set Jove afire with, and enforc&#8217;d the god</line>
<line>Snatch up the goodly boy and set him by him,</line>
<line>A shining constellation. What a brow,</line>
<line>Of what a spacious majesty, he carries,</line>
<line>Arch&#8217;d like the great-ey&#8217;d Juno&#8217;s, but far sweeter,</line>
<line>Smoother than Pelops&#8217; shoulder! Fame and Honor</line>
<line>Methinks from hence, as from a promontory</line>
<line>Pointed in heaven, should clap their wings and sing</line>
<line>To all the under world the loves and fights</line>
<line>Of gods and such men near &#8217;em. Palamon</line>
<line>Is but his foil, to him, a mere dull shadow;</line>
<line>He&#8217;s swarth and meagre, of an eye as heavy</line>
<line>As if he had lost his mother; a still temper,</line>
<line>No stirring in him, no alacrity,</line>
<line>Of all this sprightly sharpness, not a smile.</line>
<line>Yet these that we count errors may become him:</line>
<line>Narcissus was a sad boy, but a heavenly.</line>
<line>O, who can find the bent of woman&#8217;s fancy?</line>
<line>I am a fool, my reason is lost in me;</line>
<line>I have no choice, and I have lied so lewdly</line>
<line>That women ought to beat me. On my knees</line>
<line>I ask thy pardon: Palamon, thou art alone</line>
<line>And only beautiful, and these the eyes,</line>
<line>These the bright lamps of beauty, that command</line>
<line>And threaten Love, and what young maid dare cross &#8217;em?</line>
<line>What a bold gravity, and yet inviting,</line>
<line>Has this brown manly face! O Love, this only</line>
<line>From this hour is complexion. Lie there, Arcite,</line>
<line>Thou art a changeling to him, a mere gypsy,</line>
<line>And this the noble body. I am sotted,</line>
<line>Utterly lost. My virgin&#8217;s faith has fled me;</line>
<line>For if my brother but even now had ask&#8217;d me</line>
<line>Whether I lov&#8217;d, I had run mad for Arcite;</line>
<line>Now if my sister&#8212;more for Palamon.</line>
<line>Stand both together: now, come ask me, brother&#8212;</line>
<line>Alas, I know not! Ask me now, sweet sister&#8212;</line>
<line>I may go look! What a mere child is fancy,</line>

<line>You that have seen them, what they are.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. MESS.</speaker>
<line offset="8">I will, sir,</line>
<line>And truly what I think. Six braver spirits</line>
<line>Than these they have brought (if we judge by the outside)</line>
<line>I never saw nor read of. He that stands</line>
<line>In the first place with Arcite, by his seeming</line>
<line>Should be a stout man, by his face a prince</line>
<line>(His very looks so say him), his complexion</line>
<line>Nearer a brown than black; stern, and yet noble,</line>
<line>Which shows him hardy, fearless, proud of dangers.</line>
<line>The circles of his eyes show fire within him,</line>
<line>And as a heated lion, so he looks;</line>
<line>His hair hangs long behind him, black and shining</line>
<line>Like ravens&#8217; wings; his shoulders broad and strong,</line>
<line>Arm&#8217;d long and round, and on his thigh a sword</line>
<line>Hung by a curious baldrick, when he frowns</line>
<line>To seal his will with. Better, o&#8217; my conscience,</line>
<line>Was never soldier&#8217;s friend.</line>

<line>Pray speak him, friend.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PIR.</speaker>
<line offset="5">I guess he is a prince too,</line>
<line>And if it may be, greater; for his show</line>
<line>Has all the ornament of honor in&#8217;t.</line>
<line>He&#8217;s somewhat bigger than the knight he spoke of,</line>
<line>But of a face far sweeter; his complexion</line>
<line>Is, as a ripe grape, ruddy. He has felt</line>
<line>Without doubt what he fights for, and so apter</line>
<line>To make this cause his own. In &#8217;s face appears</line>
<line>All the fair hopes of what he undertakes,</line>
<line>And when he&#8217;s angry, then a settled valor</line>
<line>(Not tainted with extremes) runs through his body,</line>
<line>And guides his arm to brave things. Fear he cannot,</line>
<line>He shows no such soft temper. His head&#8217;s yellow,</line>
<line>Hard-hair&#8217;d, and curl&#8217;d, thick twin&#8217;d like ivy-tods,</line>
<line>Not to undo with thunder. In his face</line>
<line>The livery of the warlike maid appears,</line>
<line>Pure red and white, for yet no beard has blest him;</line>
<line>And in his rolling eyes sits victory,</line>
<line>As if she ever meant to crown his valor.</line>
<line>His nose stands high, a character of honor;</line>

<speaker>1. MESS.</speaker>
<line offset="9">Methinks,</line>

<line>Great and fine art in nature. He&#8217;s white-hair&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Not wanton white, but such a manly color</line>
<line>Next to an auburn; tough and nimble set,</line>
<line>Which shows an active soul; his arms are brawny,</line>
<line>Lin&#8217;d with strong sinews; to the shoulder-piece</line>
<line>Gently they swell, like women new conceiv&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Which speaks him prone to labor, never fainting</line>
<line>Under the weight of arms; stout-hearted, still,</line>
<line>But when he stirs, a tiger. He&#8217;s grey-ey&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Which yields compassion where he conquers; sharp</line>
<line>To spy advantages, and where he finds &#8217;em,</line>
<line>He&#8217;s swift to make &#8217;em his. He does no wrongs,</line>
<line>Nor takes none. He&#8217;s round-fac&#8217;d, and when he smiles</line>
<line>He shows a lover, when he frowns, a soldier.</line>
<line>About his head he wears the winner&#8217;s oak,</line>
<line>And in it stuck the favor of his lady.</line>
<line>His age some six and thirty. In his hand</line>
<line>He bears a charging-staff emboss&#8217;d with silver.</line>

Then will I make Palamon a nosegay, then let him mark me&#8212;then&#8212;</line>

<line>Faith, I&#8217;ll tell you; sometime we go to barley-break, we of the blessed. Alas, &#8217;tis a sore life they have i&#8217; th&#8217; tother place, such burning, frying, boiling, hissing, howling, chatt&#8217;ring, cursing! O, they have shrowd measure! Take heed: if one be mad, or hang or drown themselves, thither they go&#8212;Jupiter bless us!&#8212;and there shall we be put in a cauldron of lead and usurers&#8217; grease, amongst a whole million of cutpurses, and there boil like a gammon of bacon that will never be enough.</line>

<speaker>DAUGH.</speaker>
<line>Lords and courtiers that have got maids with child, they are in this place. They shall stand in fire up to the nav&#8217;l, and in ice up to th&#8217; heart, and there th&#8217; offending part burns, and the deceiving part freezes: in troth a very grievous punishment, as one would think, for such a trifle. Believe me, one would marry a leprous witch to be rid on&#8217;t, I&#8217;ll assure you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DOCT.</speaker>
<line>How she continues this fancy! &#8217;Tis not an engraff&#8217;d madness, but a most thick and profound melancholy.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DAUGH.</speaker>
<line>To hear there a proud lady and a proud city-wife howl together! I were a beast and I&#8217;ld call it good sport. One cries, &#8220;O, this smoke!&#8221; th&#8217; other, &#8220;This fire!&#8221; One cries, &#8220;O, that ever I did it behind the arras!&#8221; and then howls; th&#8217; other curses a suing fellow and her garden-house.</line>

<speaker>JAIL.</speaker>
<line>What think you of her, sir?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DOCT.</speaker>
<line>I think she has a perturb&#8217;d mind, which I cannot minister to.</line>

<line>Alas, what then?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DOCT.</speaker>
<line>Understand you she ever affected any man ere she beheld Palamon?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JAIL.</speaker>
<line>I was once, sir, in great hope she had fix&#8217;d her liking on this gentleman, my friend.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WOOER.</speaker>
<line>I did think so too, and would account I had a great penn&#8217;worth on&#8217;t to give half my state that both she and I at this present stood unfeignedly on the same terms.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DOCT.</speaker>
<line>That intemp&#8217;rate surfeit of her eye hath distemper&#8217;d the other senses. They may return and settle again to execute their preordain&#8217;d faculties, but they are now in a most extravagant vagary. This you must do: confine her to a place where the light may rather seem to steal in than be permitted. Take upon you, young sir her friend, the name of Palamon, say you come to eat with her, and to commune of love. This will catch her attention, for this her mind beats upon; other objects that are inserted &#8217;tween her mind and eye become the pranks and friskins of her madness. Sing to her such green songs of love as she says Palamon hath sung in prison. Come to her, stuck in as sweet flowers as the season is mistress of, and thereto make an addition of some other compounded odors which are grateful to the sense. All this shall become Palamon, for Palamon can sing, and Palamon is sweet, and ev&#8217;ry good thing. Desire to eat with her, carve her, drink to her, and still among intermingle your petition of grace and acceptance into her favor. Learn what maids have been her companions and play-feres, and let them repair to her with Palamon in their mouths, and appear with tokens, as if they suggested for him. It is a falsehood she is in, which is with falsehoods to be combated. This may bring her to eat, to sleep, and reduce what&#8217;s now out of square in her into their former law and regiment. I have seen it approv&#8217;d, how many times I know not, but to make the number more I have great hope in this. I will, between the passages of this project, come in with my appliance. Let us put it in execution; and hasten the success, which doubt not will bring forth comfort.</line>

<line>Knights, kinsmen, lovers, yea, my sacrifices,</line>
<line>True worshippers of Mars, whose spirit in you</line>
<line>Expels the seeds of fear, and th&#8217; apprehension</line>
<line>Which still is farther off it, go with me</line>
<line>Before the god of our profession. There</line>
<line>Require of him the hearts of lions and</line>
<line>The breath of tigers, yea, the fierceness too,</line>
<line>Yea, the speed also&#8212;to go on, I mean,</line>
<line>Else wish we to be snails. You know my prize</line>
<line>Must be dragg&#8217;d out of blood; force and great feat</line>
<line>Must put my garland on, where she sticks</line>
<line>The queen of flowers. Our intercession then</line>
<line>Must be to him that makes the camp a cestron</line>
<line>Brimm&#8217;d with the blood of men. Give me your aid</line>
<line>And bend your spirits towards him.</line>

<stagedir>They advance to the altar of Mars and fall on their faces; then kneel.</stagedir>

<line>Thou mighty one, that with thy power hast turn&#8217;d</line>
<line>Green Neptune into purple; whose approach</line>
<line>Comets prewarn, whose havoc in vast field</line>
<line>Unearthed skulls proclaim, whose breath blows down</line>

<line>The mason&#8217;d turrets, that both mak&#8217;st and break&#8217;st</line>

<stagedir>Here they fall on their faces as formerly, and there is heard clanging of armor, with a short thunder, as the burst of a battle, whereupon they all rise and bow to the altar.</stagedir>

<line>Shaker of o&#8217;er-rank states, thou grand decider</line>
<line>Of dusty and old titles, that heal&#8217;st with blood</line>
<line>The earth when it is sick, and cur&#8217;st the world</line>
<line>O&#8217; th&#8217; plurisy of people! I do take</line>
<line>Thy signs auspiciously, and in thy name</line>
<line>To my design march boldly.&#8212;Let us go.</line>

<line>You whose free nobleness do make my cause</line>
<line>Your personal hazard. To the goddess Venus</line>
<line>Commend we our proceeding, and implore</line>
<line>Her power unto our party.</line>

<stagedir>Here they advance to the altar of Venus, and fall on their faces; then kneel, as formerly.</stagedir>

<line>Hail, sovereign queen of secrets, who hast power</line>
<line>To call the fiercest tyrant from his rage,</line>
<line>And weep unto a girl; that hast the might,</line>
<line>Even with an eye-glance, to choke Mars&#8217;s drum</line>
<line>And turn th&#8217; alarm to whispers; that canst make</line>
<line>A cripple flourish with his crutch, and cure him</line>
<line>Before Apollo; that mayst force the king</line>
<line>To be his subject&#8217;s vassal, and induce</line>
<line>Stale gravity to dance; the poll&#8217;d bachelor,</line>
<line>Whose youth, like wanton boys through bonfires,</line>
<line>Have skipp&#8217;d thy flame, at seventy thou canst catch,</line>
<line>And make him, to the scorn of his hoarse throat,</line>
<line>Abuse young lays of love. What godlike power</line>
<line>Hast thou not power upon? To Phoebus thou</line>
<line>Add&#8217;st flames, hotter than his; the heavenly fires</line>
<line>Did scorch his mortal son, thine him. The huntress</line>
<line>All moist and cold, some say, began to throw</line>
<line>Her bow away, and sigh. Take to thy grace</line>
<line>Me thy vow&#8217;d soldier, who do bear thy yoke</line>
<line>As &#8217;twere a wreath of roses, yet is heavier</line>
<line>Than lead itself, stings more than nettles. I</line>
<line>Have never been foul-mouth&#8217;d against thy law,</line>
<line>Nev&#8217;r reveal&#8217;d secret, for I knew none&#8212;would not,</line>
<line>Had I kenn&#8217;d all that were. I never practiced</line>
<line>Upon man&#8217;s wife, nor would the libels read</line>
<line>Of liberal wits. I never at great feasts</line>
<line>Sought to betray a beauty, but have blush&#8217;d</line>
<line>At simp&#8217;ring sirs that did. I have been harsh</line>
<line>To large confessors, and have hotly ask&#8217;d them</line>
<line>If they had mothers; I had one, a woman,</line>
<line>And women &#8217;twere they wrong&#8217;d. I knew a man</line>
<line>Of eighty winters&#8212;this I told them&#8212;who</line>
<line>A lass of fourteen brided. &#8217;Twas thy power</line>
<line>To put life into dust: the aged cramp</line>
<line>Had screw&#8217;d his square foot round,</line>
<line>The gout had knit his fingers into knots,</line>
<line>Torturing convulsions from his globy eyes</line>
<line>Had almost drawn their spheres, that what was life</line>
<line>In him seem&#8217;d torture. This anatomy</line>
<line>Had by his young fair fere a boy, and I</line>
<line>Believ&#8217;d it was his, for she swore it was,</line>
<line>And who would not believe her? Brief, I am</line>
<line>To those that prate and have done, no companion;</line>
<line>To those that boast and have not, a defier;</line>
<line>To those that would and cannot, a rejoicer.</line>
<line>Yea, him I do not love that tells close offices</line>
<line>The foulest way, nor names concealments in</line>
<line>The boldest language. Such a one I am,</line>
<line>And vow that lover never yet made sigh</line>
<line>Truer than I. O then, most soft sweet goddess,</line>
<line>Give me the victory of this question, which</line>
<line>Is true love&#8217;s merit, and bless me with a sign</line>
<line>Of thy great pleasure.</line>

<stagedir>Here music is heard; doves are seen to flutter. They fall again upon their faces, then on their knees.</stagedir>

<line>O thou that from eleven to ninety reign&#8217;st</line>
<line>In mortal bosoms, whose chase is this world,</line>
<line>And we in herds thy game, I give thee thanks</line>
<line>For this fair token, which being laid unto</line>
<line>Mine innocent true heart, arms in assurance</line>
<line>My body to this business.&#8212;Let us rise</line>
<line>And bow before the goddess. Time comes on.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>They bow. Exeunt.</stagedir>

<stagedir>Still music of records. Enter Emilia in white, her hair about her shoulders, and wearing a wheaten wreath; one in white holding up her train, her hair stuck with flowers; one before her carrying a silver hind, in which is convey&#8217;d incense and sweet odors, which being set upon the altar of Diana, her maids standing aloof, she sets fire to it; then they curtsy and kneel.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>EMIL.</speaker>
<line>O sacred, shadowy, cold, and constant queen,</line>
<line>Abandoner of revels, mute, contemplative,</line>
<line>Sweet, solitary, white as chaste, and pure</line>
<line>As wind-fann&#8217;d snow, who to thy female knights</line>
<line>Allow&#8217;st no more blood than will make a blush,</line>
<line>Which is their order&#8217;s robe: I here, thy priest,</line>
<line>Am humbled &#8217;fore thine altar. O, vouchsafe,</line>
<line>With that thy rare green eye&#8212;which never yet</line>
<line>Beheld thing maculate&#8212;look on thy virgin,</line>
<line>And, sacred silver mistress, lend thine ear</line>
<line>(Which nev&#8217;r heard scurril term, into whose port</line>
<line>Ne&#8217;er ent&#8217;red wanton sound) to my petition,</line>
<line>Season&#8217;d with holy fear. This is my last</line>
<line>Of vestal office; I am bride-habited,</line>
<line>But maiden-hearted. A husband I have &#8217;pointed,</line>
<line>But do not know him. Out of two I should</line>
<line>Choose one, and pray for his success, but I</line>
<line>Am guiltless of election. Of mine eyes</line>
<line>Were I to lose one, they are equal precious,</line>
<line>I could doom neither; that which perish&#8217;d should</line>
<line>Go to&#8217;t unsentenc&#8217;d. Therefore, most modest queen,</line>
<line>He of the two pretenders that best loves me</line>
<line>And has the truest title in&#8217;t, let him</line>
<line>Take off my wheaten garland, or else grant</line>
<line>The file and quality I hold I may</line>
<line>Continue in thy band.</line>

<stagedir>Here the hind vanishes under the altar, and in the place ascends a rose tree, having one rose upon it.</stagedir>

<line>See what our general of ebbs and flows</line>
<line>Out from the bowels of her holy altar</line>
<line>With sacred act advances: but one rose!</line>
<line>If well inspir&#8217;d, this battle shall confound</line>
<line>Both these brave knights, and I, a virgin flow&#8217;r,</line>
<line>Must grow alone, unpluck&#8217;d.</line>

<stagedir>Here is heard a sudden twang of instruments, and the rose falls from the tree, which vanishes under the altar.</stagedir>

<line>The flow&#8217;r is fall&#8217;n, the tree descends. O mistress,</line>
<line>Thou here dischargest me. I shall be gather&#8217;d,</line>
<line>I think so, but I know not thine own will:</line>
<line>Unclasp thy mystery.&#8212;I hope she&#8217;s pleas&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Her signs were gracious.</line>

<speaker>EMIL.</speaker>
<line>Arcite is gently visag&#8217;d; yet his eye</line>
<line>Is like an engine bent, or a sharp weapon</line>
<line>In a soft sheath; mercy and manly courage</line>
<line>Are bedfellows in his visage. Palamon</line>
<line>Has a most menacing aspect, his brow</line>
<line>Is grav&#8217;d, and seems to bury what it frowns on,</line>
<line>Yet sometime &#8217;tis not so, but alters to</line>
<line>The quality of his thoughts; long time his eye</line>
<line>Will dwell upon his object; melancholy</line>
<line>Becomes him nobly. So does Arcite&#8217;s mirth,</line>
<line>But Palamon&#8217;s sadness is a kind of mirth,</line>
<line>So mingled as if mirth did make him sad,</line>
<line>And sadness merry; those darker humors that</line>
<line>Stick misbecomingly on others, on him</line>
<line>Live in fair dwelling.</line>

<stagedir>Cornets. Trumpets sound as to a charge.</stagedir>

<line>Hark how yon spurs to spirit do incite</line>
<line>The princes to their proof! Arcite may win me,</line>

<line>The spoiling of his figure. O, what pity</line>
<line>Enough for such a chance? If I were by,</line>
<line>I might do hurt, for they would glance their eyes</line>
<line>Toward my seat, and in that motion might</line>
<line>Omit a ward, or forfeit an offense,</line>

<line>Each part of him to th&#8217; all I have spoke, your Arcite</line>
<line>Did not lose by&#8217;t; for he that was thus good</line>

<line>Anon the other, then again the first,</line>

<line offset="3">Ah ha, my friend, my friend,</line>
<line>Your gentle daughter gave me freedom once;</line>
<line>You&#8217;ll see&#8217;t done now forever. Pray how does she?</line>

<line>Is it a maid?</line>

<speech>

<line offset="3">Verily I think so,</line>
<line>A right good creature, more to me deserving</line>
<line>Than I can quite or speak of.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ALL KNIGHTS.</speaker>
<line offset="6">Commend us to her.</line>

<line>We&#8217;ll follow cheerfully.</line>

<stagedir>A great noise within crying &#8220;Run! Save! Hold!&#8221; </stagedir>

<stagedir>Enter in haste a Messenger.</stagedir>

<line>Hold, hold! O, hold, hold, hold!</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Pirithous in haste.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>PIR.</speaker>
<line>Hold ho! It is a cursed haste you made</line>
<line>If you have done so quickly. Noble Palamon,</line>
<line>The gods will show their glory in a life</line>
<line>That thou art yet to lead.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAL.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Can that be, when</line>
<line>Venus I have said is false? How do things fare?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PIR.</speaker>
<line>Arise, great sir, and give the tidings ear</line>

<stagedir>Palamon rises.</stagedir>
<line>That are most dearly sweet and bitter.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAL.</speaker>
<line offset="8">What</line>
<line>Hath wak&#8217;d us from our dream?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PIR.</speaker>
<line offset="7">List then: your cousin,</line>
<line>Mounted upon a steed that Emily</line>
<line>Did first bestow on him&#8212;a black one, owing</line>
<line>Not a hair-worth of white, which some will say</line>
<line>Weakens his price, and many will not buy</line>
<line>His goodness with this note; which superstition</line>
<line>Here finds allowance&#8212;on this horse is Arcite</line>
<line>Trotting the stones of Athens, which the calkins</line>
<line>Did rather tell than trample; for the horse</line>
<line>Would make his length a mile, if&#8217;t pleas&#8217;d his rider</line>
<line>To put pride in him. As he thus went counting</line>
<line>The flinty pavement, dancing as &#8217;twere to th&#8217; music</line>
<line>His own hoofs made (for as they say from iron</line>
<line>Came music&#8217;s origin), what envious flint,</line>
<line>Cold as old Saturn, and like him possess&#8217;d</line>
<line>With fire malevolent, darted a spark,</line>
<line>Or what fierce sulphur else, to this end made,</line>
<line>I comment not&#8212;the hot horse, hot as fire,</line>
<line>Took toy at this, and fell to what disorder</line>
<line>His power could give his will, bounds, comes on end,</line>
<line>Forgets school-doing, being therein train&#8217;d,</line>
<line>And of kind manage; pig-like he whines</line>
<line>At the sharp rowel, which he frets at rather</line>
<line>Than any jot obeys; seeks all foul means</line>
<line>Of boist&#8217;rous and rough jad&#8217;ry, to disseat</line>
<line>His lord that kept it bravely. When nought serv&#8217;d,</line>
<line>When neither curb would crack, girth break, nor diff&#8217;ring plunges</line>
<line>Disroot his rider whence he grew, but that</line>
<line>He kept him &#8217;tween his legs, on his hind hoofs</line>
<line>On end he stands,</line>
<line>That Arcite&#8217;s legs, being higher than his head,</line>
<line>Seem&#8217;d with strange art to hang. His victor&#8217;s wreath</line>
<line>Even then fell off his head; and presently</line>
<line>Backward the jade comes o&#8217;er, and his full poise</line>
<line>Becomes the rider&#8217;s load. Yet is he living,</line>
<line>But such a vessel &#8217;tis that floats but for</line>
<line>The surge that next approaches. He much desires</line>
<line>To have some speech with you. Lo he appears.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Theseus, Hippolyta, Emilia, Arcite in a chair.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>PAL.</speaker>
<line>O miserable end of our alliance!</line>
<line>The gods are mighty, Arcite. If thy heart,</line>
<line>Thy worthy, manly heart, be yet unbroken,</line>
<line>Give me thy last words; I am Palamon,</line>
<line>One that yet loves thee dying.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ARC.</speaker>
<line>Take Emilia,</line>
<line>And with her all the world&#8217;s joy. Reach thy hand;</line>
<line>Farewell. I have told my last hour; I was false,</line>
<line>Yet never treacherous. Forgive me, cousin.</line>
<line>One kiss from fair Emilia.&#8212;&#8217;Tis done.</line>
<line>Take her. I die.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Dies.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>PAL.</speaker>
<line offset="3">Thy brave soul seek Elysium!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>EMIL.</speaker>
<line>I&#8217;ll close thine eyes, prince; blessed souls be with thee!</line>
<line>Thou art a right good man, and while I live,</line>
<line>This day I give to tears.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAL.</speaker>
<line offset="5">And I to honor.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>THE.</speaker>
<line>In this place first you fought; ev&#8217;n very here</line>
<line>I sund&#8217;red you. Acknowledge to the gods</line>
<line>Our thanks that you are living.</line>
<line>His part is play&#8217;d, and though it were too short,</line>
<line>He did it well; your day is length&#8217;ned, and</line>
<line>The blissful dew of heaven does arrouse you.</line>
<line>The powerful Venus well hath grac&#8217;d her altar,</line>
<line>And given you your love. Our master Mars</line>
<line>Hath vouch&#8217;d his oracle, and to Arcite gave</line>
<line>The grace of the contention So the deities</line>
<line>Have show&#8217;d due justice.&#8212;Bear this hence.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Arcite is carried out.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>PAL.</speaker>
<line offset="9">O cousin,</line>
<line>That we should things desire which do cost us</line>
<line>The loss of our desire! That nought could buy</line>
<line>Dear love but loss of dear love!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>THE.</speaker>
<line offset="7">Never fortune</line>
<line>Did play a subtler game. The conquer&#8217;d triumphs,</line>
<line>The victor has the loss; yet in the passage</line>
<line>The gods have been most equal. Palamon,</line>
<line>Your kinsman hath confess&#8217;d the right o&#8217; th&#8217; lady</line>
<line>Did lie in you, for you first saw her, and</line>
<line>Even then proclaim&#8217;d your fancy. He restor&#8217;d her</line>
<line>As your stol&#8217;n jewel, and desir&#8217;d your spirit</line>
<line>To send him hence forgiven. The gods my justice</line>
<line>Take from my hand, and they themselves become</line>
<line>The executioners. Lead your lady off;</line>
<line>And call your lovers from the stage of death,</line>
<line>Whom I adopt my friends. A day or two</line>
<line>Let us look sadly, and give grace unto</line>
<line>The funeral of Arcite, in whose end</line>
<line>The visages of bridegrooms we&#8217;ll put on</line>
<line>And smile with Palamon; for whom an hour,</line>
<line>But one hour since, I was as dearly sorry</line>
<line>As glad of Arcite; and am now as glad</line>
<line>As for him sorry. O you heavenly charmers,</line>
<line>What things you make of us! For what we lack</line>
<line>We laugh, for what we have are sorry, still</line>
<line>Are children in some kind. Let us be thankful</line>
<line>For that which is, and with you leave dispute</line>
<line>That are above our question. Let&#8217;s go off,</line>
<line>And bear us like the time.</line>

<speaker>EPI.</speaker>
<line>I would now ask ye how ye like the play,</line>
<line>But as it is with schoolboys, cannot say;</line>
<line>I am cruel fearful. Pray yet stay a while,</line>
<line>And let me look upon ye. No man smile?</line>
<line>Then it goes hard, I see. He that has</line>
<line>Lov&#8217;d a young handsome wench then, show his face&#8212;</line>
<line>&#8217;Tis strange if none be here&#8212;and if he will</line>
<line>Against his conscience, let him hiss, and kill</line>
<line>Our market. &#8217;Tis in vain, I see, to stay ye;</line>
<line>Have at the worst can come, then! Now what say ye?</line>
<line>And yet mistake me not: I am not bold,</line>
<line>We have no such cause. If the tale we have told</line>
<line>(For &#8217;tis no other) any way content ye</line>
<line>(For to that honest purpose it was meant ye),</line>
<line>We have our end; and ye shall have ere long</line>
<line>I dare say many a better, to prolong</line>
<line>Your old loves to us. We, and all our might,</line>
<line>Rest at your service. Gentlemen, good night.</line>
