<SPEAKER>SUF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As by your high imperial Majesty</LINE>
<LINE>I had in charge at my depart for France,</LINE>
<LINE>As procurator to your Excellence,</LINE>
<LINE>To marry Princess Margaret for your Grace;</LINE>
<LINE>So in the famous ancient city Tours,</LINE>
<LINE>In presence of the Kings of France and Sicil,</LINE>
<LINE>The Dukes of Orleance, Calaber, Bretagne, and Alanson,</LINE>
<LINE>Seven earls, twelve barons, and twenty reverend bishops,</LINE>
<LINE>I have perform&#8217;d my task, and was espous&#8217;d;</LINE>
<LINE>And humbly now upon my bended knee,</LINE>
<LINE>In sight of England and her lordly peers,</LINE>
<LINE>Deliver up my title in the Queen</LINE>
<LINE>To your most gracious hands, that are the substance</LINE>
<LINE>Of that great shadow I did represent:</LINE>
<LINE>The happiest gift that ever marquess gave,</LINE>
<LINE>The fairest queen that ever king receiv&#8217;d.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Suffolk, arise. Welcome, Queen Margaret,</LINE>
<LINE>I can express no kinder sign of love</LINE>
<LINE>Than this kind kiss. O Lord, that lends me life,</LINE>
<LINE>Lend me a heart replete with thankfulness!</LINE>
<LINE>For thou hast given me in this beauteous face</LINE>
<LINE>A world of earthly blessings to my soul,</LINE>
<LINE>If sympathy of love unite our thoughts.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Great King of England, and my gracious lord,</LINE>
<LINE>The mutual conference that my mind hath had,</LINE>
<LINE>By day, by night, waking and in my dreams,</LINE>

<LINE>Her sight did ravish, but her grace in speech,</LINE>
<LINE>Her words yclad with wisdom&#8217;s majesty,</LINE>
<LINE>Makes me from wond&#8217;ring fall to weeping joys,</LINE>
<LINE>Such is the fullness of my heart&#8217;s content.</LINE>
<LINE>Lords, with one cheerful voice welcome my love.</LINE>

Item, It is further agreed between them, that the duchy of Anjou and the county of Maine shall be releas&#8217;d and deliver&#8217;d over to the King her father&#8221;&#8212;</LINE>

<LINE>Uncle, how now?</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Pardon me, gracious lord,</LINE>
<LINE>Some sudden qualm hath struck me at the heart,</LINE>
<LINE>And dimm&#8217;d mine eyes, that I can read no further.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Uncle of Winchester, I pray read on.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Reads.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>&#8220;Item, It is further agreed between them, that the duchy of Anjou and the county of Maine shall be releas&#8217;d and deliver&#8217;d over to the King her father, and she sent over of the King of England&#8217;s own proper cost and charges, without having any dowry.&#8221;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>They please us well. Lord Marquess, kneel down.</LINE>
<LINE>We here create thee the first Duke of Suffolk,</LINE>
<LINE>And girt thee with the sword. Cousin of York,</LINE>
<LINE>We here discharge your Grace from being Regent</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217; th&#8217; parts of France, till term of eighteen months</LINE>
<LINE>Be full expir&#8217;d. Thanks, uncle Winchester,</LINE>
<LINE>Gloucester, York, Buckingham, Somerset,</LINE>
<LINE>Salisbury, and Warwick;</LINE>
<LINE>We thank you all for this great favor done</LINE>
<LINE>In entertainment to my princely queen.</LINE>

<LINE>To see her coronation be perform&#8217;d.</LINE>
</SPEECH>
<STAGEDIR>Exeunt King, Queen, and Suffolk. Manent the rest, stayed by Gloucester.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Brave peers of England, pillars of the state,</LINE>
<LINE>To you Duke Humphrey must unload his grief,</LINE>
<LINE>Your grief, the common grief of all the land.</LINE>
<LINE>What? did my brother Henry spend his youth,</LINE>
<LINE>His valor, coin, and people, in the wars?</LINE>
<LINE>Did he so often lodge in open field,</LINE>
<LINE>In winter&#8217;s cold and summer&#8217;s parching heat,</LINE>
<LINE>To conquer France, his true inheritance?</LINE>
<LINE>And did my brother Bedford toil his wits,</LINE>
<LINE>To keep by policy what Henry got?</LINE>
<LINE>Have you yourselves, Somerset, Buckingham,</LINE>
<LINE>Brave York, Salisbury, and victorious Warwick,</LINE>
<LINE>Receiv&#8217;d deep scars in France and Normandy?</LINE>
<LINE>Or hath mine uncle Beauford and myself,</LINE>
<LINE>With all the learned Council of the realm,</LINE>
<LINE>Studied so long, sat in the Council-house</LINE>
<LINE>Early and late, debating to and fro</LINE>
<LINE>How France and Frenchmen might be kept in awe,</LINE>
<LINE>And hath his Highness in his infancy</LINE>
<LINE>Crowned in Paris in despite of foes?</LINE>
<LINE>And shall these labors and these honors die?</LINE>
<LINE>Shall Henry&#8217;s conquest, Bedford&#8217;s vigilance,</LINE>
<LINE>Your deeds of war, and all our counsel die?</LINE>
<LINE>O peers of England, shameful is this league,</LINE>
<LINE>Fatal this marriage, cancelling your fame,</LINE>
<LINE>Blotting your names from books of memory,</LINE>
<LINE>Rasing the characters of your renown,</LINE>
<LINE>Defacing monuments of conquer&#8217;d France,</LINE>
<LINE>Undoing all, as all had never been!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nephew, what means this passionate discourse,</LINE>
<LINE>This peroration with such circumstance?</LINE>
<LINE>For France, &#8217;tis ours; and we will keep it still.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, uncle, we will keep it, if we can;</LINE>
<LINE>But now it is impossible we should.</LINE>
<LINE>Suffolk, the new-made duke that rules the roast,</LINE>
<LINE>Hath given the duchy of Anjou, and Maine,</LINE>
<LINE>Unto the poor King Reignier, whose large style</LINE>
<LINE>Agrees not with the leanness of his purse.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now by the death of Him that died for all,</LINE>
<LINE>These counties were the keys of Normandy.</LINE>
<LINE>But wherefore weeps Warwick, my valiant son?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For grief that they are past recovery;</LINE>
<LINE>For were there hope to conquer them again,</LINE>
<LINE>My sword should shed hot blood, mine eyes no tears.</LINE>
<LINE>Anjou and Maine? myself did win them both.</LINE>
<LINE>Those provinces these arms of mine did conquer,</LINE>
<LINE>And are the cities that I got with wounds</LINE>
<LINE>Deliver&#8217;d up again with peaceful words?</LINE>
<LINE>Mort Dieu!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For Suffolk&#8217;s duke, may he be suffocate,</LINE>
<LINE>That dims the honor of this warlike isle!</LINE>
<LINE>France should have torn and rent my very heart</LINE>
<LINE>Before I would have yielded to this league.</LINE>
<LINE>I never read but England&#8217;s kings have had</LINE>
<LINE>Large sums of gold and dowries with their wives,</LINE>
<LINE>And our King Henry gives away his own,</LINE>
<LINE>To match with her that brings no vantages.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A proper jest, and never heard before,</LINE>
<LINE>That Suffolk should demand a whole fifteenth</LINE>
<LINE>For costs and charges in transporting her!</LINE>
<LINE>She should have stay&#8217;d in France, and starv&#8217;d in France,</LINE>
<LINE>Before&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My Lord of Gloucester, now ye grow too hot:</LINE>
<LINE>It was the pleasure of my lord the King.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My Lord of Winchester, I know your mind.</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis not my speeches that you do mislike,</LINE>
<LINE>But &#8217;tis my presence that doth trouble ye;</LINE>
<LINE>Rancor will out. Proud prelate, in thy face</LINE>
<LINE>I see thy fury. If I longer stay,</LINE>
<LINE>We shall begin our ancient bickerings.</LINE>
<LINE>Lordings, farewell, and say, when I am gone,</LINE>
<LINE>I prophesied France will be lost ere long.</LINE>
</SPEECH>
<STAGEDIR>Exit Humphrey.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So, there goes our Protector in a rage.</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis known to you he is mine enemy;</LINE>
<LINE>Nay more, an enemy unto you all,</LINE>
<LINE>And no great friend, I fear me, to the King.</LINE>
<LINE>Consider, lords, he is the next of blood,</LINE>
<LINE>And heir-apparent to the English crown.</LINE>
<LINE>Had Henry got an empire by his marriage,</LINE>
<LINE>And all the wealthy kingdoms of the west,</LINE>
<LINE>There&#8217;s reason he should be displeas&#8217;d at it.</LINE>
<LINE>Look to it, lords, let not his smoothing words</LINE>
<LINE>Bewitch your hearts. Be wise and circumspect.</LINE>
<LINE>What though the common people favor him,</LINE>
<LINE>Calling him &#8220;Humphrey, the good Duke of Gloucester,&#8221;</LINE>
<LINE>Clapping their hands, and crying with loud voice,</LINE>
<LINE>&#8220;Jesu maintain your royal Excellence!&#8221;</LINE>
<LINE>With &#8220;God preserve the good Duke Humphrey!&#8221;</LINE>
<LINE>I fear me, lords, for all this flattering gloss,</LINE>
<LINE>He will be found a dangerous Protector.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BUCK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why should he then protect our sovereign,</LINE>
<LINE>He being of age to govern of himself?</LINE>
<LINE>Cousin of Somerset, join you with me,</LINE>
<LINE>And all together, with the Duke of Suffolk,</LINE>
<LINE>We&#8217;ll quickly hoise Duke Humphrey from his seat.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This weighty business will not brook delay,</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll to the Duke of Suffolk presently.</LINE>
</SPEECH>
<STAGEDIR>Exit Cardinal.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SOM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Cousin of Buckingham, though Humphrey&#8217;s pride</LINE>
<LINE>And greatness of his place be grief to us,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet let us watch the haughty Cardinal;</LINE>
<LINE>His insolence is more intolerable</LINE>
<LINE>Than all the princes in the land beside.</LINE>
<LINE>If Gloucester be displac&#8217;d, he&#8217;ll be Protector.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BUCK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Or thou or I, Somerset, will be Protector,</LINE>
<LINE>Despite Duke Humphrey or the Cardinal.</LINE>
</SPEECH>
<STAGEDIR>Exeunt Buckingham and Somerset.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pride went before, ambition follows him.</LINE>
<LINE>While these do labor for their own preferment,</LINE>
<LINE>Behooves it us to labor for the realm.</LINE>
<LINE>I never saw but Humphrey Duke of Gloucester</LINE>
<LINE>Did bear him like a noble gentleman.</LINE>
<LINE>Oft have I seen the haughty Cardinal,</LINE>
<LINE>More like a soldier than a man o&#8217; th&#8217; church,</LINE>
<LINE>As stout and proud as he were lord of all,</LINE>
<LINE>Swear like a ruffian, and demean himself</LINE>
<LINE>Unlike the ruler of a commonweal.</LINE>
<LINE>Warwick, my son, the comfort of my age,</LINE>
<LINE>Thy deeds, thy plainness, and thy house-keeping,</LINE>
<LINE>Hath won the greatest favor of the commons,</LINE>
<LINE>Excepting none but good Duke Humphrey;</LINE>
<LINE>And, brother York, thy acts in Ireland,</LINE>
<LINE>In bringing them to civil discipline,</LINE>
<LINE>Thy late exploits done in the heart of France</LINE>
<LINE>When thou wert Regent for our sovereign,</LINE>
<LINE>Have made thee fear&#8217;d and honor&#8217;d of the people;</LINE>
<LINE>Join we together, for the public good,</LINE>
<LINE>In what we can to bridle and suppress</LINE>
<LINE>The pride of Suffolk and the Cardinal,</LINE>
<LINE>With Somerset&#8217;s and Buckingham&#8217;s ambition;</LINE>
<LINE>And as we may, cherish Duke Humphrey&#8217;s deeds</LINE>
<LINE>While they do tend the profit of the land.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So God help Warwick, as he loves the land</LINE>
<LINE>And common profit of his country!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And so says York&#8212;</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>
<LINE offset="4">for he hath greatest cause.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then let&#8217;s make haste away, and look unto the main.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Unto the main? O father, Maine is lost!</LINE>
<LINE>That Maine which by main force Warwick did win,</LINE>
<LINE>And would have kept so long as breath did last!</LINE>
<LINE>Main chance, father, you meant, but I meant Maine,</LINE>
<LINE>Which I will win from France, or else be slain.</LINE>
</SPEECH>
<STAGEDIR>Exeunt Warwick and Salisbury. Manet York.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Anjou and Maine are given to the French,</LINE>
<LINE>Paris is lost, the state of Normandy</LINE>
<LINE>Stands on a tickle point now they are gone.</LINE>
<LINE>Suffolk concluded on the articles,</LINE>
<LINE>The peers agreed, and Henry was well pleas&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>To change two dukedoms for a duke&#8217;s fair daughter.</LINE>
<LINE>I cannot blame them all, what is&#8217;t to them?</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis thine they give away, and not their own.</LINE>
<LINE>Pirates may make cheap pennyworths of their pillage</LINE>
<LINE>And purchase friends and give to courtezans,</LINE>
<LINE>Still revelling like lords till all be gone;</LINE>
<LINE>While as the silly owner of the goods</LINE>
<LINE>Weeps over them, and wrings his hapless hands,</LINE>
<LINE>And shakes his head, and trembling stands aloof,</LINE>
<LINE>While all is shar&#8217;d and all is borne away,</LINE>
<LINE>Ready to starve, and dare not touch his own.</LINE>
<LINE>So York must sit, and fret, and bite his tongue,</LINE>
<LINE>While his own lands are bargain&#8217;d for and sold.</LINE>
<LINE>Methinks the realms of England, France, and Ireland</LINE>
<LINE>Bear that proportion to my flesh and blood</LINE>
<LINE>As did the fatal brand Althaea burnt</LINE>
<LINE>Unto the Prince&#8217;s heart of Calydon.</LINE>
<LINE>Anjou and Maine both given unto the French!</LINE>
<LINE>Cold news for me; for I had hope of France,</LINE>
<LINE>Even as I have of fertile England&#8217;s soil.</LINE>
<LINE>A day will come when York shall claim his own,</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore I will take the Nevils&#8217; parts,</LINE>
<LINE>And make a show of love to proud Duke Humphrey,</LINE>
<LINE>And, when I spy advantage, claim the crown,</LINE>
<LINE>For that&#8217;s the golden mark I seek to hit.</LINE>
<LINE>Nor shall proud Lancaster usurp my right,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor hold the sceptre in his childish fist,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor wear the diadem upon his head,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose church-like humors fits not for a crown.</LINE>
<LINE>Then, York, be still awhile, till time do serve.</LINE>
<LINE>Watch thou, and wake when others be asleep,</LINE>
<LINE>To pry into the secrets of the state,</LINE>
<LINE>Till Henry, surfeiting in joys of love</LINE>
<LINE>With his new bride and England&#8217;s dear-bought queen,</LINE>
<LINE>And Humphrey with the peers be fall&#8217;n at jars:</LINE>
<LINE>Then will I raise aloft the milk-white rose,</LINE>
<LINE>With whose sweet smell the air shall be perfum&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>And in my standard bear the arms of York,</LINE>
<LINE>To grapple with the house of Lancaster;</LINE>
<LINE>And force perforce I&#8217;ll make him yield the crown,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose bookish rule hath pull&#8217;d fair England down.</LINE>

<LINE>Why droops my lord, like over-ripen&#8217;d corn</LINE>

<LINE>Why doth the great Duke Humphrey knit his brows,</LINE>
<LINE>As frowning at the favors of the world?</LINE>

<LINE>Tut, this was nothing but an argument</LINE>
<LINE>That he that breaks a stick of Gloucester&#8217;s grove</LINE>
<LINE>Shall lose his head for his presumption.</LINE>
<LINE>But list to me, my Humphrey, my sweet duke:</LINE>
<LINE>Methought I sate in seat of majesty</LINE>
<LINE>In the cathedral church of Westminster,</LINE>
<LINE>And in that chair where kings and queens were crown&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Where Henry and Dame Margaret kneel&#8217;d to me,</LINE>
<LINE>And on my head did set the diadem.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, Eleanor, then must I chide outright.</LINE>
<LINE>Presumptuous dame, ill-nurtur&#8217;d Eleanor,</LINE>
<LINE>Art thou not second woman in the realm?</LINE>
<LINE>And the Protector&#8217;s wife, belov&#8217;d of him?</LINE>
<LINE>Hast thou not worldly pleasure at command</LINE>
<LINE>Above the reach or compass of thy thought?</LINE>
<LINE>And wilt thou still be hammering treachery,</LINE>
<LINE>To tumble down thy husband and thyself</LINE>
<LINE>From top of honor to disgrace&#8217;s feet?</LINE>
<LINE>Away from me, and let me hear no more!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUCH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, what, my lord? are you so choleric</LINE>
<LINE>With Eleanor, for telling but her dream?</LINE>
<LINE>Next time I&#8217;ll keep my dreams unto myself,</LINE>
<LINE>And not be check&#8217;d.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>Nay, be not angry, I am pleas&#8217;d again.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>MESS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My Lord Protector, &#8217;tis his Highness&#8217; pleasure</LINE>
<LINE>You do prepare to ride unto Saint Albons,</LINE>
<LINE>Where as the King and Queen do mean to hawk.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I go. Come, Nell, thou wilt ride with us?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUCH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, my good lord, I&#8217;ll follow presently.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exit Humphrey with Messenger.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Follow I must, I cannot go before</LINE>
<LINE>While Gloucester bears this base and humble mind.</LINE>
<LINE>Were I a man, a duke, and next of blood,</LINE>
<LINE>I would remove these tedious stumbling-blocks,</LINE>
<LINE>And smooth my way upon their headless necks;</LINE>
<LINE>And, being a woman, I will not be slack</LINE>
<LINE>To play my part in Fortune&#8217;s pageant.</LINE>
<LINE>Where are you there? Sir John! Nay, fear not, man,</LINE>
<LINE>We are alone, here&#8217;s none but thee and I.</LINE>

<LINE>Your Grace&#8217;s title shall be multiplied.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUCH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What say&#8217;st thou, man? Hast thou as yet conferr&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>With Margery Jordan, the cunning witch,</LINE>
<LINE>With Roger Bolingbrook, the conjurer?</LINE>
<LINE>And will they undertake to do me good?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HUME.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This they have promised, to show your Highness</LINE>
<LINE>A spirit rais&#8217;d from depth of under ground,</LINE>
<LINE>That shall make answer to such questions</LINE>
<LINE>As by your Grace shall be propounded him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUCH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is enough, I&#8217;ll think upon the questions.</LINE>
<LINE>When from Saint Albons we do make return,</LINE>
<LINE>We&#8217;ll see these things effected to the full.</LINE>
<LINE>Here, Hume, take this reward. Make merry, man,</LINE>

<LINE>Marry, and shall. But how now, Sir John Hume?</LINE>
<LINE>Seal up your lips, and give no words but mum;</LINE>
<LINE>The business asketh silent secrecy.</LINE>
<LINE>Dame Eleanor gives gold to bring the witch;</LINE>
<LINE>Gold cannot come amiss, were she a devil.</LINE>
<LINE>Yet have I gold flies from another coast&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>I dare not say from the rich Cardinal</LINE>
<LINE>And from the great and new-made Duke of Suffolk;</LINE>
<LINE>Yet I do find it so; for, to be plain,</LINE>
<LINE>They, knowing Dame Eleanor&#8217;s aspiring humor,</LINE>
<LINE>Have hired me to undermine the Duchess,</LINE>
<LINE>And buzz these conjurations in her brain.</LINE>
<LINE>They say, &#8220;A crafty knave does need no broker,&#8221;</LINE>
<LINE>Yet am I Suffolk and the Cardinal&#8217;s broker.</LINE>
<LINE>Hume, if you take not heed, you shall go near</LINE>
<LINE>To call them both a pair of crafty knaves.</LINE>
<LINE>Well, so it stands; and thus, I fear, at last</LINE>
<LINE>Hume&#8217;s knavery will be the Duchess&#8217; wrack,</LINE>
<LINE>And her attainture will be Humphrey&#8217;s fall.</LINE>
<LINE>Sort how it will, I shall have gold for all.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My Lord of Suffolk, say, is this the guise,</LINE>
<LINE>Is this the fashions in the court of England?</LINE>
<LINE>Is this the government of Britain&#8217;s isle,</LINE>
<LINE>And this the royalty of Albion&#8217;s king?</LINE>
<LINE>What, shall King Henry be a pupil still</LINE>
<LINE>Under the surly Gloucester&#8217;s governance?</LINE>
<LINE>Am I a queen in title and in style,</LINE>
<LINE>And must be made a subject to a duke?</LINE>
<LINE>I tell thee, Pole, when in the city Tours</LINE>
<LINE>Thou ran&#8217;st a-tilt in honor of my love</LINE>
<LINE>And stol&#8217;st away the ladies&#8217; hearts of France,</LINE>
<LINE>I thought King Henry had resembled thee</LINE>
<LINE>In courage, courtship, and proportion;</LINE>
<LINE>But all his mind is bent to holiness,</LINE>
<LINE>To number Ave-Maries on his beads;</LINE>
<LINE>His champions are the prophets and apostles,</LINE>
<LINE>His weapons holy saws of sacred writ,</LINE>
<LINE>His study is his tilt-yard, and his loves</LINE>
<LINE>Are brazen images of canonized saints.</LINE>
<LINE>I would the college of the Cardinals</LINE>
<LINE>Would choose him Pope and carry him to Rome,</LINE>
<LINE>And set the triple crown upon his head&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>That were a state fit for his holiness.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Madam, be patient. As I was cause</LINE>
<LINE>Your Highness came to England, so will I</LINE>
<LINE>In England work your Grace&#8217;s full content.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Beside the haughty Protector, have we Beauford</LINE>
<LINE>The imperious churchman, Somerset, Buckingham,</LINE>
<LINE>And grumbling York; and not the least of these</LINE>
<LINE>But can do more in England than the King.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And he of these that can do most of all</LINE>
<LINE>Cannot do more in England than the Nevils:</LINE>
<LINE>Salisbury and Warwick are no simple peers.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not all these lords do vex me half so much</LINE>
<LINE>As that proud dame, the Lord Protector&#8217;s wife:</LINE>
<LINE>She sweeps it through the court with troops of ladies,</LINE>
<LINE>More like an empress than Duke Humphrey&#8217;s wife.</LINE>
<LINE>Strangers in court do take her for the Queen.</LINE>
<LINE>She bears a duke&#8217;s revenues on her back,</LINE>
<LINE>And in her heart she scorns our poverty.</LINE>
<LINE>Shall I not live to be aveng&#8217;d on her?</LINE>
<LINE>Contemptuous base-born callot as she is,</LINE>
<LINE>She vaunted &#8217;mongst her minions t&#8217; other day,</LINE>
<LINE>The very train of her worst wearing gown</LINE>
<LINE>Was better worth than all my father&#8217;s lands,</LINE>
<LINE>Till Suffolk gave two dukedoms for his daughter.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Madam, myself have lim&#8217;d a bush for her,</LINE>
<LINE>And plac&#8217;d a choir of such enticing birds</LINE>
<LINE>That she will light to listen to the lays,</LINE>
<LINE>And never mount to trouble you again.</LINE>
<LINE>So let her rest; and, madam, list to me,</LINE>
<LINE>For I am bold to counsel you in this.</LINE>
<LINE>Although we fancy not the Cardinal,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet must we join with him and with the lords,</LINE>
<LINE>Till we have brought Duke Humphrey in disgrace.</LINE>
<LINE>As for the Duke of York, this late complaint</LINE>
<LINE>Will make but little for his benefit.</LINE>
<LINE>So one by one we&#8217;ll weed them all at last,</LINE>
<LINE>And you yourself shall steer the happy helm.</LINE>

<LINE>Resign it then and leave thine insolence.</LINE>

<LINE>The commonwealth hath daily run to wrack,</LINE>

<SPEAKER>QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thy sale of offices and towns in France,</LINE>

<LINE>But to the matter that we have in hand.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>SUF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Before we make election, give me leave</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll tell thee, Suffolk, why I am unmeet:</LINE>
<LINE>First, for I cannot flatter thee in pride;</LINE>
<LINE>Next, if I be appointed for the place,</LINE>
<LINE>My Lord of Somerset will keep me here</LINE>
<LINE>Without discharge, money, or furniture,</LINE>
<LINE>Till France be won into the Dauphin&#8217;s hands.</LINE>
<LINE>Last time, I danc&#8217;d attendance on his will</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Please it your Majesty, this is the man</LINE>
<LINE>That doth accuse his master of high treason.</LINE>
<LINE>His words were these: that Richard Duke of York</LINE>
<LINE>Was rightful heir unto the English crown</LINE>
<LINE>And that your Majesty was an usurper.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Say, man, were these thy words?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOR.</SPEAKER>

<SPEAKER>PETER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By these ten bones, my lords holding up his hands, he did speak them to me in the garret one night, as we were scouring my Lord of York&#8217;s armor.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Base dunghill villain and mechanical,</LINE>

<LINE>Let him have all the rigor of the law.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alas, my lord, hang me if ever I spake the words. My accuser is my prentice, and when I did correct him for his fault the other day, he did vow upon his knees he would be even with me. I have good witness of this; therefore I beseech your Majesty, do not cast away an honest man for a villain&#8217;s accusation.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This doom, my lord, if I may judge:</LINE>
<LINE>Let Somerset be Regent o&#8217;er the French,</LINE>
<LINE>Because in York this breeds suspicion;</LINE>
<LINE>And let these have a day appointed them</LINE>
<LINE>For single combat in convenient place,</LINE>
<LINE>For he hath witness of his servant&#8217;s malice.</LINE>
<LINE>This is the law, and this Duke Humphrey&#8217;s doom.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, my good Lords of Salisbury and Warwick,</LINE>
<LINE>Our simple supper ended, give me leave</LINE>
<LINE>In this close walk to satisfy myself</LINE>
<LINE>In craving your opinion of my title,</LINE>
<LINE>Which is infallible, to England&#8217;s crown.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, I long to hear it at full.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sweet York, begin; and if thy claim be good,</LINE>
<LINE>The Nevils are thy subjects to command.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then thus:</LINE>
<LINE>Edward the Third, my lords, had seven sons:</LINE>
<LINE>The first, Edward the Black Prince, Prince of Wales;</LINE>
<LINE>The second, William of Hatfield; and the third,</LINE>
<LINE>Lionel Duke of Clarence; next to whom</LINE>
<LINE>Was John of Gaunt, the Duke of Lancaster;</LINE>
<LINE>The fift was Edmund Langley, Duke of York;</LINE>
<LINE>The sixt was Thomas of Woodstock, Duke of Gloucester;</LINE>
<LINE>William of Windsor was the seventh and last.</LINE>
<LINE>Edward the Black Prince died before his father,</LINE>
<LINE>And left behind him Richard, his only son,</LINE>
<LINE>Who after Edward the Third&#8217;s death reign&#8217;d as king</LINE>
<LINE>Till Henry Bullingbrook, Duke of Lancaster,</LINE>
<LINE>The eldest son and heir of John of Gaunt,</LINE>
<LINE>Crown&#8217;d by the name of Henry the Fourth,</LINE>
<LINE>Seiz&#8217;d on the realm, depos&#8217;d the rightful king,</LINE>
<LINE>Sent his poor queen to France, from whence she came,</LINE>
<LINE>And him to Pomfret; where, as all you know,</LINE>
<LINE>Harmless Richard was murdered traitorously.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Father, the Duke hath told the truth;</LINE>
<LINE>Thus got the house of Lancaster the crown.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Which now they hold by force and not by right;</LINE>
<LINE>For Richard, the first son&#8217;s heir, being dead,</LINE>
<LINE>The issue of the next son should have reign&#8217;d.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But William of Hatfield died without an heir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The third son, Duke of Clarence, from whose line</LINE>
<LINE>I claim the crown, had issue, Philippe, a daughter,</LINE>
<LINE>Who married Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March;</LINE>
<LINE>Edmund had issue, Roger Earl of March;</LINE>
<LINE>Roger had issue, Edmund, Anne, and Eleanor.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This Edmund, in the reign of Bullingbrook,</LINE>
<LINE>As I have read, laid claim unto the crown,</LINE>
<LINE>And but for Owen Glendower, had been king,</LINE>
<LINE>Who kept him in captivity till he died.</LINE>
<LINE>But, to the rest.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>His eldest sister, Anne,</LINE>
<LINE>My mother, being heir unto the crown,</LINE>
<LINE>Married Richard Earl of Cambridge, who was</LINE>
<LINE>To Edmund Langley, Edward the Third&#8217;s fift son, son.</LINE>
<LINE>By her I claim the kingdom. She was heir</LINE>
<LINE>To Roger Earl of March, who was the son</LINE>
<LINE>Of Edmund Mortimer, who married Philippe,</LINE>
<LINE>Sole daughter unto Lionel Duke of Clarence;</LINE>
<LINE>So, if the issue of the elder son</LINE>
<LINE>Succeed before the younger, I am king.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What plain proceedings is more plain than this?</LINE>
<LINE>Henry doth claim the crown from John of Gaunt,</LINE>
<LINE>The fourth son, York claims it from the third;</LINE>
<LINE>Till Lionel&#8217;s issue fails, his should not reign.</LINE>
<LINE>It fails not yet, but flourishes in thee,</LINE>
<LINE>And in thy sons, fair slips of such a stock.</LINE>
<LINE>Then, father Salisbury, kneel we together,</LINE>
<LINE>And in this private plot be we the first</LINE>
<LINE>That shall salute our rightful sovereign</LINE>
<LINE>With honor of his birthright to the crown.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BOTH. WAR. AND SAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Long live our sovereign Richard, England&#8217;s king!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We thank you, lords. But I am not your king</LINE>
<LINE>Till I be crown&#8217;d, and that my sword be stain&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>With heart-blood of the house of Lancaster;</LINE>
<LINE>And that&#8217;s not suddenly to be perform&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>But with advice and silent secrecy.</LINE>
<LINE>Do you as I do in these dangerous days:</LINE>
<LINE>Wink at the Duke of Suffolk&#8217;s insolence,</LINE>
<LINE>At Beauford&#8217;s pride, at Somerset&#8217;s ambition,</LINE>
<LINE>At Buckingham, and all the crew of them,</LINE>
<LINE>Till they have snar&#8217;d the shepherd of the flock,</LINE>
<LINE>That virtuous prince, the good Duke Humphrey.</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis that they seek; and they in seeking that</LINE>
<LINE>Shall find their deaths, if York can prophesy.</LINE>

<LINE>Because I wish&#8217;d this world&#8217;s eternity.</LINE>
<LINE>Stanley, I prithee go, and take me hence,</LINE>
<LINE>I care not whither, for I beg no favor;</LINE>
<LINE>Only convey me where thou art commanded.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>STAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, madam, that is to the Isle of Man,</LINE>
<LINE>There to be us&#8217;d according to your state.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUCH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That&#8217;s bad enough, for I am but reproach;</LINE>
<LINE>And shall I then be us&#8217;d reproachfully?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>STAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Like to a duchess, and Duke Humphrey&#8217;s lady,</LINE>
<LINE>According to that state you shall be us&#8217;d.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUCH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sheriff, farewell, and better than I fare,</LINE>
<LINE>Although thou hast been conduct of my shame.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SHER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is my office, and, madam, pardon me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUCH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, ay, farewell, thy office is discharg&#8217;d.</LINE>
<LINE>Come, Stanley, shall we go?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>STAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Madam, your penance done, throw off this sheet,</LINE>
<LINE>And go we to attire you for our journey.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUCH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My shame will not be shifted with my sheet.</LINE>
<LINE>No, it will hang upon my richest robes,</LINE>
<LINE>And show itself, attire me how I can.</LINE>
<LINE>Go, lead the way, I long to see my prison.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I muse my Lord of Gloucester is not come;</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis not his wont to be the hindmost man,</LINE>
<LINE>What e&#8217;er occasion keeps him from us now.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Can you not see? or will ye not observe</LINE>
<LINE>The strangeness of his alter&#8217;d countenance?</LINE>
<LINE>With what a majesty he bears himself,</LINE>
<LINE>How insolent of late he is become,</LINE>
<LINE>How proud, how peremptory, and unlike himself?</LINE>
<LINE>We know the time since he was mild and affable,</LINE>
<LINE>And if we did but glance a far-off look,</LINE>
<LINE>Immediately he was upon his knee,</LINE>
<LINE>That all the court admir&#8217;d him for submission;</LINE>
<LINE>But meet him now, and, be it in the morn,</LINE>
<LINE>When every one will give the time of day,</LINE>
<LINE>He knits his brow and shows an angry eye,</LINE>
<LINE>And passeth by with stiff unbowed knee,</LINE>
<LINE>Disdaining duty that to us belongs.</LINE>
<LINE>Small curs are not regarded when they grin,</LINE>
<LINE>But great men tremble when the lion roars,</LINE>
<LINE>And Humphrey is no little man in England.</LINE>
<LINE>First note that he is near you in descent,</LINE>
<LINE>And should you fall, he is the next will mount.</LINE>
<LINE>Me seemeth then it is no policy,</LINE>
<LINE>Respecting what a rancorous mind he bears</LINE>
<LINE>And his advantage following your decease,</LINE>
<LINE>That he should come about your royal person,</LINE>
<LINE>Or be admitted to your Highness&#8217; Council.</LINE>
<LINE>By flattery hath he won the commons&#8217; hearts;</LINE>
<LINE>And when he please to make commotion,</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis to be fear&#8217;d they all will follow him.</LINE>
<LINE>Now &#8217;tis the spring, and weeds are shallow-rooted;</LINE>
<LINE>Suffer them now, and they&#8217;ll o&#8217;ergrow the garden,</LINE>
<LINE>And choke the herbs for want of husbandry.</LINE>
<LINE>The reverent care I bear unto my lord</LINE>
<LINE>Made me collect these dangers in the Duke.</LINE>
<LINE>If it be fond, call it a woman&#8217;s fear;</LINE>
<LINE>Which fear, if better reasons can supplant,</LINE>
<LINE>I will subscribe, and say I wrong&#8217;d the Duke.</LINE>
<LINE>My Lord of Suffolk, Buckingham, and York,</LINE>
<LINE>Reprove my allegation if you can,</LINE>
<LINE>Or else conclude my words effectual.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well hath your Highness seen into this duke;</LINE>
<LINE>And, had I first been put to speak my mind,</LINE>
<LINE>I think I should have told your Grace&#8217;s tale.</LINE>
<LINE>The Duchess by his subornation,</LINE>
<LINE>Upon my life, began her devilish practices;</LINE>
<LINE>Or if he were not privy to those faults,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet, by reputing of his high descent,</LINE>
<LINE>As next the King he was successive heir,</LINE>
<LINE>And such high vaunts of his nobility,</LINE>
<LINE>Did instigate the bedlam brain-sick Duchess</LINE>
<LINE>By wicked means to frame our sovereign&#8217;s fall.</LINE>
<LINE>Smooth runs the water where the brook is deep,</LINE>
<LINE>And in his simple show he harbors treason.</LINE>
<LINE>The fox barks not when he would steal the lamb.</LINE>
<LINE>No, no, my sovereign, Gloucester is a man</LINE>
<LINE>Unsounded yet and full of deep deceit.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Did he not, contrary to form of law,</LINE>
<LINE>Devise strange deaths for small offenses done?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And did he not, in his protectorship,</LINE>
<LINE>Levy great sums of money through the realm</LINE>
<LINE>For soldiers&#8217; pay in France, and never sent it,</LINE>
<LINE>By means whereof the towns each day revolted?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BUCK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tut, these are petty faults to faults unknown,</LINE>
<LINE>Which time will bring to light in smooth Duke Humphrey.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lords, at once: the care you have of us</LINE>
<LINE>To mow down thorns that would annoy our foot</LINE>
<LINE>Is worthy praise; but shall I speak my conscience,</LINE>
<LINE>Our kinsman Gloucester is as innocent</LINE>
<LINE>From meaning treason to our royal person</LINE>
<LINE>As is the sucking lamb or harmless dove.</LINE>
<LINE>The Duke is virtuous, mild, and too well given</LINE>
<LINE>To dream on evil or to work my downfall.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ah, what&#8217;s more dangerous than this fond affiance!</LINE>
<LINE>Seems he a dove? his feathers are but borrow&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>For he&#8217;s disposed as the hateful raven.</LINE>
<LINE>Is he a lamb? his skin is surely lent him,</LINE>
<LINE>For he&#8217;s inclin&#8217;d as is the ravenous wolves.</LINE>
<LINE>Who cannot steal a shape that means deceit?</LINE>
<LINE>Take heed, my lord, the welfare of us all</LINE>
<LINE>Hangs on the cutting short that fraudful man.</LINE>
</SPEECH>
<STAGEDIR>Enter Somerset.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SOM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>All health unto my gracious sovereign!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Welcome, Lord Somerset. What news from France?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SOM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That all your interest in those territories</LINE>
<LINE>Is utterly bereft you: all is lost.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Cold news, Lord Somerset; but God&#8217;s will be done!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK.</SPEAKER>
<STAGEDIR>Aside.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Cold news for me; for I had hope of France</LINE>
<LINE>As firmly as I hope for fertile England.</LINE>
<LINE>Thus are my blossoms blasted in the bud,</LINE>
<LINE>And caterpillars eat my leaves away;</LINE>
<LINE>But I will remedy this gear ere long,</LINE>
<LINE>Or sell my title for a glorious grave.</LINE>
</SPEECH>
<STAGEDIR>Enter Gloucester.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>All happiness unto my lord the King!</LINE>
<LINE>Pardon, my liege, that I have stay&#8217;d so long.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, Gloucester, know that thou art come too soon,</LINE>
<LINE>Unless thou wert more loyal than thou art.</LINE>
<LINE>I do arrest thee of high treason here.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, Suffolk, thou shalt not see me blush</LINE>
<LINE>Nor change my countenance for this arrest;</LINE>
<LINE>A heart unspotted is not easily daunted.</LINE>
<LINE>The purest spring is not so free from mud</LINE>
<LINE>As I am clear from treason to my sovereign.</LINE>
<LINE>Who can accuse me? Wherein am I guilty?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis thought, my lord, that you took bribes of France,</LINE>
<LINE>And being Protector, stay&#8217;d the soldiers&#8217; pay,</LINE>
<LINE>By means whereof his Highness hath lost France.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is it but thought so? What are they that think it?</LINE>
<LINE>I never robb&#8217;d the soldiers of their pay,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor ever had one penny bribe from France.</LINE>
<LINE>So help me God, as I have watch&#8217;d the night,</LINE>
<LINE>Ay, night by night, in studying good for England.</LINE>
<LINE>That doit that e&#8217;er I wrested from the King,</LINE>
<LINE>Or any groat I hoarded to my use,</LINE>
<LINE>Be brought against me at my trial day!</LINE>
<LINE>No; many a pound of mine own proper store,</LINE>
<LINE>Because I would not tax the needy commons,</LINE>
<LINE>Have I dispursed to the garrisons,</LINE>
<LINE>And never ask&#8217;d for restitution.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It serves you well, my lord, to say so much.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I say no more than truth, so help me God!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In your protectorship you did devise</LINE>
<LINE>Strange tortures for offenders, never heard of,</LINE>
<LINE>That England was defam&#8217;d by tyranny.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, &#8217;tis well known that, whiles I was Protector,</LINE>
<LINE>Pity was all the fault that was in me;</LINE>
<LINE>For I should melt at an offender&#8217;s tears,</LINE>
<LINE>And lowly words were ransom for their fault.</LINE>
<LINE>Unless it were a bloody murderer,</LINE>
<LINE>Or foul felonious thief that fleec&#8217;d poor passengers,</LINE>
<LINE>I never gave them condign punishment.</LINE>
<LINE>Murder indeed, that bloody sin, I tortur&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>Above the felon or what trespass else.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, these faults are easy, quickly answer&#8217;d;</LINE>
<LINE>But mightier crimes are laid unto your charge,</LINE>
<LINE>Whereof you cannot easily purge yourself.</LINE>
<LINE>I do arrest you in his Highness&#8217; name,</LINE>
<LINE>And here commit you to my Lord Cardinal</LINE>
<LINE>To keep, until your further time of trial.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My Lord of Gloucester, &#8217;tis my special hope</LINE>
<LINE>That you will clear yourself from all suspense.</LINE>
<LINE>My conscience tells me you are innocent.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ah, gracious lord, these days are dangerous:</LINE>
<LINE>Virtue is chok&#8217;d with foul ambition,</LINE>
<LINE>And charity chas&#8217;d hence by rancor&#8217;s hand;</LINE>
<LINE>Foul subornation is predominant,</LINE>
<LINE>And equity exil&#8217;d your Highness&#8217; land.</LINE>
<LINE>I know their complot is to have my life;</LINE>
<LINE>And if my death might make this island happy,</LINE>
<LINE>And prove the period of their tyranny,</LINE>
<LINE>I would expend it with all willingness.</LINE>
<LINE>But mine is made the prologue to their play;</LINE>
<LINE>For thousands more, that yet suspect no peril,</LINE>
<LINE>Will not conclude their plotted tragedy.</LINE>
<LINE>Beauford&#8217;s red sparkling eyes blab his heart&#8217;s malice,</LINE>
<LINE>And Suffolk&#8217;s cloudy brow his stormy hate;</LINE>
<LINE>Sharp Buckingham unburdens with his tongue</LINE>
<LINE>The envious load that lies upon his heart;</LINE>
<LINE>And dogged York, that reaches at the moon,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose overweening arm I have pluck&#8217;d back,</LINE>
<LINE>By false accuse doth level at my life.</LINE>
<LINE>And you, my sovereign lady, with the rest,</LINE>
<LINE>Causeless have laid disgraces on my head,</LINE>
<LINE>And with your best endeavor have stirr&#8217;d up</LINE>
<LINE>My liefest liege to be mine enemy.</LINE>
<LINE>Ay, all of you have laid your heads together&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Myself had notice of your conventicles&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>And all to make away my guiltless life.</LINE>
<LINE>I shall not want false witness to condemn me,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor store of treasons to augment my guilt.</LINE>
<LINE>The ancient proverb will be well effected:</LINE>
<LINE>&#8220;A staff is quickly found to beat a dog.&#8221;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My liege, his railing is intolerable.</LINE>
<LINE>If those that care to keep your royal person</LINE>
<LINE>From treason&#8217;s secret knife and traitors&#8217; rage</LINE>
<LINE>Be thus upbraided, chid, and rated at,</LINE>
<LINE>And the offender granted scope of speech,</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Twill make them cool in zeal unto your Grace.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hath he not twit our sovereign lady here</LINE>
<LINE>With ignominious words, though clerkly couch&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>As if she had suborned some to swear</LINE>
<LINE>False allegations to o&#8217;erthrow his state?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But I can give the loser leave to chide.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Far truer spoke than meant. I lose indeed;</LINE>
<LINE>Beshrew the winners, for they play&#8217;d me false!</LINE>
<LINE>And well such losers may have leave to speak.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BUCK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He&#8217;ll wrest the sense and hold us here all day.</LINE>
<LINE>Lord Cardinal, he is your prisoner.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sirs, take away the Duke, and guard him sure.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ah, thus King Henry throws away his crutch</LINE>
<LINE>Before his legs be firm to bear his body.</LINE>
<LINE>Thus is the shepherd beaten from thy side,</LINE>
<LINE>And wolves are gnarling who shall gnaw thee first.</LINE>
<LINE>Ah, that my fear were false, ah, that it were!</LINE>
<LINE>For, good King Henry, thy decay I fear.</LINE>
</SPEECH>
<STAGEDIR>Exit Gloucester with the Cardinal&#8217;s Men.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lords, what to your wisdoms seemeth best,</LINE>
<LINE>Do or undo, as if ourself were here.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, will your Highness leave the parliament?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, Margaret; my heart is drown&#8217;d with grief,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose flood begins to flow within mine eyes;</LINE>
<LINE>My body round engirt with misery&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>For what&#8217;s more miserable than discontent?</LINE>
<LINE>Ah, uncle Humphrey, in thy face I see</LINE>
<LINE>The map of honor, truth, and loyalty;</LINE>
<LINE>And yet, good Humphrey, is the hour to come</LINE>
<LINE>That e&#8217;er I prov&#8217;d thee false or fear&#8217;d thy faith.</LINE>
<LINE>What low&#8217;ring star now envies thy estate,</LINE>
<LINE>That these great lords, and Margaret our queen,</LINE>
<LINE>Do seek subversion of thy harmless life?</LINE>
<LINE>Thou never didst them wrong, nor no man wrong;</LINE>
<LINE>And as the butcher takes away the calf,</LINE>
<LINE>And binds the wretch, and beats it when it strays,</LINE>
<LINE>Bearing it to the bloody slaughter-house,</LINE>
<LINE>Even so remorseless have they borne him hence;</LINE>
<LINE>And as the dam runs lowing up and down,</LINE>
<LINE>Looking the way her harmless young one went,</LINE>
<LINE>And can do nought but wail her darling&#8217;s loss,</LINE>
<LINE>Even so myself bewails good Gloucester&#8217;s case</LINE>
<LINE>With sad unhelpful tears, and with dimm&#8217;d eyes</LINE>
<LINE>Look after him, and cannot do him good,</LINE>
<LINE>So mighty are his vowed enemies.</LINE>
<LINE>His fortunes I will weep, and &#8217;twixt each groan</LINE>
<LINE>Say, &#8220;Who&#8217;s a traitor, Gloucester he is none.&#8221;</LINE>
</SPEECH>
<STAGEDIR>Exit with Buckingham, Salisbury, and Warwick.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Free lords, cold snow melts with the sun&#8217;s hot beams:</LINE>
<LINE>Henry my lord is cold in great affairs,</LINE>
<LINE>Too full of foolish pity; and Gloucester&#8217;s show</LINE>
<LINE>Beguiles him as the mournful crocodile</LINE>
<LINE>With sorrow snares relenting passengers;</LINE>
<LINE>Or as the snake roll&#8217;d in a flow&#8217;ring bank,</LINE>
<LINE>With shining checker&#8217;d slough, doth sting a child</LINE>
<LINE>That for the beauty thinks it excellent.</LINE>
<LINE>Believe me, lords, were none more wise than I&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>And yet herein I judge mine own wit good&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>This Gloucester should be quickly rid the world,</LINE>
<LINE>To rid us from the fear we have of him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That he should die is worthy policy,</LINE>
<LINE>But yet we want a color for his death.</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis meet he be condemn&#8217;d by course of law.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But, in my mind, that were no policy:</LINE>
<LINE>The King will labor still to save his life,</LINE>
<LINE>The commons haply rise, to save his life;</LINE>
<LINE>And yet we have but trivial argument,</LINE>
<LINE>More than mistrust, that shows him worthy death.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So that, by this, you would not have him die.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ah, York, no man alive so fain as I!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis York that hath more reason for his death.</LINE>
<LINE>But, my Lord Cardinal, and you, my Lord of Suffolk,</LINE>
<LINE>Say as you think, and speak it from your souls:</LINE>
<LINE>Were&#8217;t not all one, an empty eagle were set</LINE>
<LINE>To guard the chicken from a hungry kite,</LINE>
<LINE>As place Duke Humphrey for the King&#8217;s Protector?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So the poor chicken should be sure of death.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Madam, &#8217;tis true; and were&#8217;t not madness then,</LINE>
<LINE>To make the fox surveyor of the fold?</LINE>
<LINE>Who being accus&#8217;d a crafty murderer,</LINE>
<LINE>His guilt should be but idly posted over,</LINE>
<LINE>Because his purpose is not executed.</LINE>
<LINE>No; let him die, in that he is a fox,</LINE>
<LINE>By nature prov&#8217;d an enemy to the flock,</LINE>
<LINE>Before his chaps be stain&#8217;d with crimson blood,</LINE>
<LINE>As Humphrey, prov&#8217;d by reasons, to my liege.</LINE>
<LINE>And do not stand on quillets how to slay him;</LINE>
<LINE>Be it by gins, by snares, by subtlety,</LINE>
<LINE>Sleeping, or waking, &#8217;tis no matter how,</LINE>
<LINE>So he be dead; for that is good deceit</LINE>
<LINE>Which mates him first that first intends deceit.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thrice-noble Suffolk, &#8217;tis resolutely spoke.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not resolute, except so much were done,</LINE>
<LINE>For things are often spoke and seldom meant;</LINE>
<LINE>But that my heart accordeth with my tongue,</LINE>
<LINE>Seeing the deed is meritorious,</LINE>
<LINE>And to preserve my sovereign from his foe,</LINE>
<LINE>Say but the word, and I will be his priest.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But I would have him dead, my Lord of Suffolk,</LINE>
<LINE>Ere you can take due orders for a priest.</LINE>
<LINE>Say you consent, and censure well the deed,</LINE>
<LINE>And I&#8217;ll provide his executioner,</LINE>
<LINE>I tender so the safety of my liege.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here is my hand, the deed is worthy doing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And so say I.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK.</SPEAKER>

<LINE>He never would have stay&#8217;d in France so long.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, not to lose it all, as thou hast done.</LINE>
<LINE>I rather would have lost my life betimes</LINE>

<LINE>By staying there so long till all were lost.</LINE>

<LINE>Nay then, this spark will prove a raging fire,</LINE>

<LINE>My Lord of York, try what your fortune is.</LINE>
<LINE>Th&#8217; uncivil kerns of Ireland are in arms,</LINE>
<LINE>And temper clay with blood of Englishmen.</LINE>
<LINE>To Ireland will you lead a band of men,</LINE>
<LINE>Collected choicely, from each county some,</LINE>
<LINE>And try your hap against the Irishmen?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will, my lord, so please his Majesty.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, our authority is his consent,</LINE>
<LINE>And what we do establish he confirms.</LINE>
<LINE>Then, noble York, take thou this task in hand.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am content. Provide me soldiers, lords,</LINE>
<LINE>Whiles I take order for mine own affairs.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A charge, Lord York, that I will see perform&#8217;d.</LINE>
<LINE>But now return we to the false Duke Humphrey.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No more of him; for I will deal with him</LINE>
<LINE>That henceforth he shall trouble us no more.</LINE>
<LINE>And so break off, the day is almost spent;</LINE>
<LINE>Lord Suffolk, you and I must talk of that event.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My Lord of Suffolk, within fourteen days</LINE>
<LINE>At Bristow I expect my soldiers,</LINE>
<LINE>For there I&#8217;ll ship them all for Ireland.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll see it truly done, my Lord of York.</LINE>
</SPEECH>
<STAGEDIR>Exeunt. Manet York.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, York, or never, steel thy fearful thoughts,</LINE>
<LINE>And change misdoubt to resolution;</LINE>
<LINE>Be that thou hop&#8217;st to be, or what thou art</LINE>
<LINE>Resign to death; it is not worth th&#8217; enjoying.</LINE>
<LINE>Let pale-fac&#8217;d fear keep with the mean-born man,</LINE>
<LINE>And find no harbor in a royal heart.</LINE>
<LINE>Faster than spring-time show&#8217;rs comes thought on thought,</LINE>
<LINE>And not a thought but thinks on dignity.</LINE>
<LINE>My brain, more busy than the laboring spider,</LINE>
<LINE>Weaves tedious snares to trap mine enemies.</LINE>
<LINE>Well, nobles, well; &#8217;tis politicly done,</LINE>
<LINE>To send me packing with an host of men:</LINE>
<LINE>I fear me you but warm the starved snake,</LINE>
<LINE>Who, cherish&#8217;d in your breasts, will sting your hearts.</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Twas men I lack&#8217;d, and you will give them me;</LINE>
<LINE>I take it kindly. Yet be well assur&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>You put sharp weapons in a madman&#8217;s hands.</LINE>
<LINE>Whiles I in Ireland nourish a mighty band,</LINE>
<LINE>I will stir up in England some black storm</LINE>
<LINE>Shall blow ten thousand souls to heaven or hell;</LINE>
<LINE>And this fell tempest shall not cease to rage</LINE>
<LINE>Until the golden circuit on my head,</LINE>
<LINE>Like to the glorious sun&#8217;s transparent beams,</LINE>
<LINE>Do calm the fury of this mad-bred flaw.</LINE>
<LINE>And for a minister of my intent,</LINE>
<LINE>I have seduc&#8217;d a headstrong Kentishman,</LINE>
<LINE>John Cade of Ashford,</LINE>
<LINE>To make commotion, as full well he can,</LINE>
<LINE>Under the title of John Mortimer.</LINE>
<LINE>In Ireland have I seen this stubborn Cade</LINE>
<LINE>Oppose himself against a troop of kerns,</LINE>
<LINE>And fought so long, till that his thighs with darts</LINE>
<LINE>Were almost like a sharp-quill&#8217;d porpentine;</LINE>
<LINE>And in the end being rescued, I have seen</LINE>
<LINE>Him caper upright like a wild Morisco,</LINE>
<LINE>Shaking the bloody darts as he his bells.</LINE>
<LINE>Full often, like a shag-hair&#8217;d crafty kern,</LINE>
<LINE>Hath he conversed with the enemy,</LINE>
<LINE>And undiscover&#8217;d come to me again,</LINE>
<LINE>And given me notice of their villainies.</LINE>
<LINE>This devil here shall be my substitute;</LINE>
<LINE>For that John Mortimer, which now is dead,</LINE>
<LINE>In face, in gait, in speech, he doth resemble.</LINE>
<LINE>By this I shall perceive the commons&#8217; mind,</LINE>
<LINE>How they affect the house and claim of York.</LINE>
<LINE>Say he be taken, rack&#8217;d, and tortured,</LINE>
<LINE>I know no pain they can inflict upon him</LINE>
<LINE>Will make him say I mov&#8217;d him to those arms.</LINE>
<LINE>Say that he thrive, as &#8217;tis great like he will,</LINE>
<LINE>Why then from Ireland come I with my strength,</LINE>
<LINE>And reap the harvest which that rascal sow&#8217;d.</LINE>
<LINE>For Humphrey being dead, as he shall be,</LINE>
<LINE>And Henry put apart, the next for me.</LINE>

<LINE>Comfort, my sovereign! gracious Henry, comfort!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, doth my Lord of Suffolk comfort me?</LINE>
<LINE>Came he right now to sing a raven&#8217;s note,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose dismal tune bereft my vital pow&#8217;rs;</LINE>
<LINE>And thinks he that the chirping of a wren,</LINE>
<LINE>By crying comfort from a hollow breast,</LINE>
<LINE>Can chase away the first-conceived sound?</LINE>
<LINE>Hide not thy poison with such sug&#8217;red words.</LINE>
<LINE>Lay not thy hands on me; forbear, I say!</LINE>
<LINE>Their touch affrights me as a serpent&#8217;s sting.</LINE>
<LINE>Thou baleful messenger, out of my sight!</LINE>
<LINE>Upon thy eyeballs murderous tyranny</LINE>
<LINE>Sits in grim majesty, to fright the world.</LINE>
<LINE>Look not upon me, for thine eyes are wounding.</LINE>
<LINE>Yet do not go away. Come, basilisk,</LINE>
<LINE>And kill the innocent gazer with thy sight;</LINE>
<LINE>For in the shade of death I shall find joy;</LINE>
<LINE>In life but double death, now Gloucester&#8217;s dead.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why do you rate my Lord of Suffolk thus?</LINE>
<LINE>Although the Duke was enemy to him,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet he most Christian-like laments his death;</LINE>
<LINE>And for myself, foe as he was to me,</LINE>
<LINE>Might liquid tears or heart-offending groans</LINE>
<LINE>Or blood-consuming sighs recall his life,</LINE>
<LINE>I would be blind with weeping, sick with groans,</LINE>
<LINE>Look pale as primrose with blood-drinking sighs,</LINE>
<LINE>And all to have the noble Duke alive.</LINE>
<LINE>What know I how the world may deem of me,</LINE>
<LINE>For it is known we were but hollow friends?</LINE>
<LINE>It may be judg&#8217;d I made the Duke away,</LINE>
<LINE>So shall my name with slander&#8217;s tongue be wounded,</LINE>
<LINE>And princes&#8217; courts be fill&#8217;d with my reproach.</LINE>
<LINE>This get I by his death. Ay me, unhappy,</LINE>
<LINE>To be a queen, and crown&#8217;d with infamy!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ah, woe is me for Gloucester, wretched man!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Be woe for me, more wretched than he is.</LINE>
<LINE>What, dost thou turn away and hide thy face?</LINE>
<LINE>I am no loathsome leper, look on me.</LINE>
<LINE>What? art thou like the adder waxen deaf?</LINE>
<LINE>Be poisonous too, and kill thy forlorn queen.</LINE>
<LINE>Is all thy comfort shut in Gloucester&#8217;s tomb?</LINE>
<LINE>Why then Dame Margaret was ne&#8217;er thy joy.</LINE>
<LINE>Erect his statu&#235; and worship it,</LINE>
<LINE>And make my image but an alehouse sign.</LINE>
<LINE>Was I for this nigh wrack&#8217;d upon the sea,</LINE>
<LINE>And twice by awkward wind from England&#8217;s bank</LINE>
<LINE>Drove back again unto my native clime?</LINE>
<LINE>What boded this, but well forewarning wind</LINE>
<LINE>Did seem to say, &#8220;Seek not a scorpion&#8217;s nest,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor set no footing on this unkind shore&#8221;?</LINE>
<LINE>What did I then, but curs&#8217;d the gentle gusts,</LINE>
<LINE>And he that loos&#8217;d them forth their brazen caves,</LINE>
<LINE>And bid them blow towards England&#8217;s blessed shore,</LINE>
<LINE>Or turn our stern upon a dreadful rock?</LINE>
<LINE>Yet Aeolus would not be a murderer,</LINE>
<LINE>But left that hateful office unto thee.</LINE>
<LINE>The pretty vaulting sea refus&#8217;d to drown me,</LINE>
<LINE>Knowing that thou wouldst have me drown&#8217;d on shore</LINE>
<LINE>With tears as salt as sea, through thy unkindness.</LINE>
<LINE>The splitting rocks cow&#8217;r&#8217;d in the sinking sands,</LINE>
<LINE>And would not dash me with their ragged sides,</LINE>
<LINE>Because thy flinty heart, more hard than they,</LINE>
<LINE>Might in thy palace perish Margaret.</LINE>
<LINE>As far as I could ken thy chalky cliffs,</LINE>
<LINE>When from thy shore the tempest beat us back,</LINE>
<LINE>I stood upon the hatches in the storm;</LINE>
<LINE>And when the dusky sky began to rob</LINE>
<LINE>My earnest-gaping sight of thy land&#8217;s view,</LINE>
<LINE>I took a costly jewel from my neck,</LINE>
<LINE>A heart it was, bound in with diamonds,</LINE>
<LINE>And threw it towards thy land. The sea receiv&#8217;d it,</LINE>
<LINE>And so I wish&#8217;d thy body might my heart.</LINE>
<LINE>And even with this I lost fair England&#8217;s view,</LINE>
<LINE>And bid mine eyes be packing with my heart,</LINE>
<LINE>And call&#8217;d them blind and dusky spectacles,</LINE>
<LINE>For losing ken of Albion&#8217;s wished coast.</LINE>
<LINE>How often have I tempted Suffolk&#8217;s tongue</LINE>
<LINE>(The agent of thy foul inconstancy)</LINE>
<LINE>To sit and witch me, as Ascanius did</LINE>
<LINE>When he to madding Dido would unfold</LINE>
<LINE>His father&#8217;s acts commenc&#8217;d in burning Troy!</LINE>
<LINE>Am I not witch&#8217;d like her? or thou not false like him?</LINE>
<LINE>Ay me, I can no more! Die, Margaret!</LINE>
<LINE>For Henry weeps that thou dost live so long.</LINE>
</SPEECH>
<STAGEDIR>Noise within. Enter Warwick, Salisbury, and many Commons.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is reported, mighty sovereign,</LINE>
<LINE>That good Duke Humphrey traitorously is murd&#8217;red</LINE>
<LINE>By Suffolk and the Cardinal Beauford&#8217;s means.</LINE>
<LINE>The commons, like an angry hive of bees</LINE>
<LINE>That want their leader, scatter up and down,</LINE>
<LINE>And care not who they sting in his revenge.</LINE>
<LINE>Myself have calm&#8217;d their spleenful mutiny,</LINE>
<LINE>Until they hear the order of his death.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That he is dead, good Warwick, &#8217;tis too true,</LINE>
<LINE>But how he died God knows, not Henry.</LINE>
<LINE>Enter his chamber, view his breathless corpse,</LINE>
<LINE>And comment then upon his sudden death.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That shall I do, my liege. Stay, Salisbury,</LINE>
<LINE>With the rude multitude till I return.</LINE>
</SPEECH>
<STAGEDIR>Exit Warwick; then Salisbury with the Commons.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O Thou that judgest all things, stay my thoughts,</LINE>
<LINE>My thoughts that labor to persuade my soul</LINE>
<LINE>Some violent hands were laid on Humphrey&#8217;s life!</LINE>
<LINE>If my suspect be false, forgive me, God,</LINE>
<LINE>For judgment only doth belong to thee.</LINE>
<LINE>Fain would I go to chafe his paly lips</LINE>
<LINE>With twenty thousand kisses, and to drain</LINE>
<LINE>Upon his face an ocean of salt tears,</LINE>
<LINE>To tell my love unto his dumb deaf trunk,</LINE>
<LINE>And with my fingers feel his hand unfeeling.</LINE>
<LINE>But all in vain are these mean obsequies,</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Bed put forth with the body of Gloucester in it. Enter Warwick.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>And to survey his dead and earthy image,</LINE>
<LINE>What were it but to make my sorrow greater?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come hither, gracious sovereign, view this body.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That is to see how deep my grave is made,</LINE>
<LINE>For with his soul fled all my worldly solace;</LINE>
<LINE>For seeing him, I see my life in death.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As surely as my soul intends to live</LINE>
<LINE>With that dread King that took our state upon him,</LINE>
<LINE>To free us from his Father&#8217;s wrathful curse,</LINE>
<LINE>I do believe that violent hands were laid</LINE>
<LINE>Upon the life of this thrice-famed duke.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A dreadful oath, sworn with a solemn tongue!</LINE>
<LINE>What instance gives Lord Warwick for his vow?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>See how the blood is settled in his face.</LINE>
<LINE>Oft have I seen a timely-parted ghost,</LINE>
<LINE>Of ashy semblance, meagre, pale, and bloodless,</LINE>
<LINE>Being all descended to the laboring heart,</LINE>
<LINE>Who, in the conflict that it holds with death,</LINE>
<LINE>Attracts the same for aidance &#8217;gainst the enemy,</LINE>
<LINE>Which with the heart there cools and ne&#8217;er returneth</LINE>
<LINE>To blush and beautify the cheek again.</LINE>
<LINE>But see, his face is black and full of blood,</LINE>
<LINE>His eyeballs further out than when he lived,</LINE>
<LINE>Staring full ghastly, like a strangled man;</LINE>
<LINE>His hair uprear&#8217;d, his nostrils stretch&#8217;d with struggling;</LINE>
<LINE>His hands abroad display&#8217;d, as one that grasp&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>And tugg&#8217;d for life, and was by strength subdu&#8217;d.</LINE>
<LINE>Look, on the sheets his hair, you see, is sticking,</LINE>
<LINE>His well-proportion&#8217;d beard made rough and rugged,</LINE>
<LINE>Like to the summer&#8217;s corn by tempest lodged.</LINE>
<LINE>It cannot be but he was murd&#8217;red here,</LINE>
<LINE>The least of all these signs were probable.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, Warwick, who should do the Duke to death?</LINE>
<LINE>Myself and Beauford had him in protection,</LINE>
<LINE>And we, I hope, sir, are no murderers.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But both of you were vowed Duke Humphrey&#8217;s foes,</LINE>
<LINE>And you</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>To Cardinal.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE offset="2">forsooth, had the good Duke to keep.</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis like you would not feast him like a friend,</LINE>
<LINE>And &#8217;tis well seen he found an enemy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then you belike suspect these noblemen</LINE>
<LINE>As guilty of Duke Humphrey&#8217;s timeless death.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who finds the heifer dead and bleeding fresh,</LINE>
<LINE>And sees fast by a butcher with an axe,</LINE>
<LINE>But will suspect &#8217;twas he that made the slaughter?</LINE>
<LINE>Who finds the partridge in the puttock&#8217;s nest</LINE>
<LINE>But may imagine how the bird was dead,</LINE>
<LINE>Although the kite soar with unbloodied beak?</LINE>
<LINE>Even so suspicious is this tragedy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Are you the butcher, Suffolk? where&#8217;s your knife?</LINE>
<LINE>Is Beauford term&#8217;d a kite? where are his talons?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I wear no knife to slaughter sleeping men,</LINE>
<LINE>But here&#8217;s a vengeful sword, rusted with ease,</LINE>
<LINE>That shall be scoured in his rancorous heart</LINE>
<LINE>That slanders me with murder&#8217;s crimson badge.</LINE>
<LINE>Say, if thou dar&#8217;st, proud Lord of Warwickshire,</LINE>
<LINE>That I am faulty in Duke Humphrey&#8217;s death.</LINE>
</SPEECH>
<STAGEDIR>Exeunt Cardinal, Somerset, and others.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What dares not Warwick, if false Suffolk dare him?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He dares not calm his contumelious spirit,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor cease to be an arrogant controller,</LINE>
<LINE>Though Suffolk dare him twenty thousand times.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Madam, be still&#8212;with reverence may I say&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>For every word you speak in his behalf</LINE>
<LINE>Is slander to your royal dignity.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Blunt-witted lord, ignoble in demeanor!</LINE>
<LINE>If ever lady wrong&#8217;d her lord so much,</LINE>
<LINE>Thy mother took into her blameful bed</LINE>
<LINE>Some stern untutor&#8217;d churl; and noble stock</LINE>
<LINE>Was graft with crab-tree slip, whose fruit thou art</LINE>
<LINE>And never of the Nevils&#8217; noble race.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But that the guilt of murder bucklers thee,</LINE>
<LINE>And I should rob the deathsman of his fee,</LINE>
<LINE>Quitting thee thereby of ten thousand shames,</LINE>
<LINE>And that my sovereign&#8217;s presence makes me mild,</LINE>
<LINE>I would, false murd&#8217;rous coward, on thy knee</LINE>
<LINE>Make thee beg pardon for thy passed speech,</LINE>
<LINE>And say it was thy mother that thou meant&#8217;st,</LINE>
<LINE>That thou thyself wast born in bastardy;</LINE>
<LINE>And after all this fearful homage done,</LINE>
<LINE>Give thee thy hire and send thy soul to hell,</LINE>
<LINE>Pernicious blood-sucker of sleeping men!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou shalt be waking while I shed thy blood,</LINE>
<LINE>If from this presence thou dar&#8217;st go with me.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>WAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Away even now, or I will drag thee hence.</LINE>
<LINE>Unworthy though thou art, I&#8217;ll cope with thee,</LINE>

</SPEECH>
<STAGEDIR>Exeunt Suffolk and Warwick.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>What stronger breastplate than a heart untainted!</LINE>
<LINE>Thrice is he arm&#8217;d that hath his quarrel just;</LINE>

<LINE>Why, how now, lords? your wrathful weapons drawn</LINE>

<LINE>Why, what tumultuous clamor have we here?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>And torture him with grievous ling&#8217;ring death.</LINE>
<LINE>They say, by him the good Duke Humphrey died;</LINE>
<LINE>They say, in him they fear your Highness&#8217; death;</LINE>
<LINE>And mere instinct of love and loyalty,</LINE>
<LINE>Free from a stubborn opposite intent,</LINE>
<LINE>As being thought to contradict your liking,</LINE>
<LINE>Makes them thus forward in his banishment.</LINE>
<LINE>They say, in care of your most royal person,</LINE>
<LINE>That if your Highness should intend to sleep,</LINE>
<LINE>And charge that no man should disturb your rest</LINE>
<LINE>In pain of your dislike, or pain of death,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet notwithstanding such a strait edict,</LINE>
<LINE>Were there a serpent seen, with forked tongue,</LINE>
<LINE>That slily glided towards your Majesty,</LINE>
<LINE>It were but necessary you were wak&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Lest being suffer&#8217;d in that harmful slumber,</LINE>
<LINE>The mortal worm might make the sleep eternal.</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore do they cry, though you forbid,</LINE>
<LINE>That they will guard you, whe&#8217;er you will or no,</LINE>
<LINE>From such fell serpents as false Suffolk is;</LINE>
<LINE>With whose envenomed and fatal sting,</LINE>
<LINE>Your loving uncle, twenty times his worth,</LINE>
<LINE>They say is shamefully bereft of life.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>SUF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis like the commons, rude unpolish&#8217;d hinds,</LINE>
<LINE>Could send such message to their sovereign.</LINE>
<LINE>But you, my lord, were glad to be employ&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>To show how quaint an orator you are;</LINE>
<LINE>But all the honor Salisbury hath won</LINE>
<LINE>Is, that he was the lord embassador</LINE>
<LINE>Sent from a sort of tinkers to the King.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go, Salisbury, and tell them all from me,</LINE>
<LINE>I thank them for their tender loving care;</LINE>
<LINE>And had I not been cited so by them,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet did I purpose as they do entreat;</LINE>
<LINE>For sure, my thoughts do hourly prophesy</LINE>
<LINE>Mischance unto my state by Suffolk&#8217;s means.</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore by His majesty I swear,</LINE>

<LINE>O Henry, let me plead for gentle Suffolk!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ungentle queen, to call him gentle Suffolk!</LINE>
<LINE>No more, I say! If thou dost plead for him,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou wilt but add increase unto my wrath.</LINE>
<LINE>Had I but said, I would have kept my word;</LINE>
<LINE>But when I swear, it is irrevocable.</LINE>
<LINE>If after three days&#8217; space thou here be&#8217;st found</LINE>
<LINE>On any ground that I am ruler of,</LINE>
<LINE>The world shall not be ransom for thy life.</LINE>
<LINE>Come, Warwick, come, good Warwick, go with me,</LINE>
<LINE>I have great matters to impart to thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>Mischance and sorrow go along with you!</LINE>
<LINE>Heart&#8217;s discontent and sour affliction</LINE>
<LINE>Be playfellows to keep you company!</LINE>
<LINE>There&#8217;s two of you, the devil make a third,</LINE>
<LINE>And threefold vengeance tend upon your steps!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Cease, gentle queen, these execrations,</LINE>
<LINE>And let thy Suffolk take his heavy leave.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fie, coward woman and soft-hearted wretch!</LINE>
<LINE>Hast thou not spirit to curse thine enemy?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A plague upon them! wherefore should I curse them?</LINE>
<LINE>Would curses kill, as doth the mandrake&#8217;s groan,</LINE>
<LINE>I would invent as bitter searching terms,</LINE>
<LINE>As curst, as harsh, and horrible to hear,</LINE>
<LINE>Deliver&#8217;d strongly through my fixed teeth,</LINE>
<LINE>With full as many signs of deadly hate,</LINE>
<LINE>As lean-fac&#8217;d Envy in her loathsome cave.</LINE>
<LINE>My tongue should stumble in mine earnest words,</LINE>
<LINE>Mine eyes should sparkle like the beaten flint,</LINE>
<LINE>Mine hair be fix&#8217;d an end, as one distract;</LINE>
<LINE>Ay, every joint should seem to curse and ban;</LINE>
<LINE>And even now my burden&#8217;d heart would break,</LINE>
<LINE>Should I not curse them. Poison be their drink!</LINE>
<LINE>Gall, worse than gall, the daintiest that they taste!</LINE>
<LINE>Their sweetest shade a grove of cypress trees!</LINE>
<LINE>Their chiefest prospect murd&#8217;ring basilisks!</LINE>
<LINE>Their softest touch as smart as lizards&#8217; stings!</LINE>
<LINE>Their music frightful as the serpent&#8217;s hiss,</LINE>
<LINE>And boding screech owls make the consort full!</LINE>
<LINE>All the foul terrors in dark-seated hell&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Enough, sweet Suffolk, thou torment&#8217;st thyself,</LINE>
<LINE>And these dread curses, like the sun &#8217;gainst glass,</LINE>
<LINE>Or like an overcharged gun, recoil,</LINE>
<LINE>And turns the force of them upon thyself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You bade me ban, and will you bid me leave?</LINE>
<LINE>Now by the ground that I am banish&#8217;d from,</LINE>
<LINE>Well could I curse away a winter&#8217;s night,</LINE>
<LINE>Though standing naked on a mountain top,</LINE>
<LINE>Where biting cold would never let grass grow,</LINE>
<LINE>And think it but a minute spent in sport.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, let me entreat thee cease. Give me thy hand,</LINE>
<LINE>That I may dew it with my mournful tears;</LINE>
<LINE>Nor let the rain of heaven wet this place</LINE>
<LINE>To wash away my woeful monuments.</LINE>
<LINE>O, could this kiss be printed in thy hand,</LINE>
<LINE>That thou mightst think upon these by the seal,</LINE>
<LINE>Through whom a thousand sighs are breath&#8217;d for thee!</LINE>
<LINE>So get thee gone, that I may know my grief,</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis but surmis&#8217;d whiles thou art standing by,</LINE>
<LINE>As one that surfeits thinking on a want.</LINE>
<LINE>I will repeal thee, or, be well assur&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Adventure to be banished myself;</LINE>
<LINE>And banished I am, if but from thee.</LINE>
<LINE>Go, speak not to me; even now be gone.</LINE>
<LINE>O, go not yet! Even thus two friends condemn&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>Embrace, and kiss, and take ten thousand leaves,</LINE>
<LINE>Loather a hundred times to part than die.</LINE>
<LINE>Yet now farewell, and farewell life with thee!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thus is poor Suffolk ten times banished,</LINE>
<LINE>Once by the King, and three times thrice by thee.</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis not the land I care for, wert thou thence;</LINE>
<LINE>A wilderness is populous enough,</LINE>
<LINE>So Suffolk had thy heavenly company:</LINE>
<LINE>For where thou art, there is the world itself,</LINE>
<LINE>With every several pleasure in the world;</LINE>
<LINE>And where thou art not, desolation.</LINE>
<LINE>I can no more: live thou to joy thy life;</LINE>

<LINE>For suddenly a grievous sickness took him,</LINE>
<LINE>That makes him gasp, and stare, and catch the air,</LINE>
<LINE>Blaspheming God and cursing men on earth.</LINE>
<LINE>Sometime he talks as if Duke Humphrey&#8217;s ghost</LINE>
<LINE>Were by his side; sometime he calls the King,</LINE>
<LINE>And whispers to his pillow as to him</LINE>
<LINE>The secrets of his overcharged soul;</LINE>
<LINE>And I am sent to tell his Majesty</LINE>
<LINE>That even now he cries aloud for him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>Ay me! what is this world! what news are these!</LINE>
<LINE>But wherefore grieve I at an hour&#8217;s poor loss,</LINE>
<LINE>Omitting Suffolk&#8217;s exile, my soul&#8217;s treasure?</LINE>
<LINE>Why only, Suffolk, mourn I not for thee,</LINE>
<LINE>And with the southern clouds contend in tears,</LINE>
<LINE>Theirs for the earth&#8217;s increase, mine for my sorrows?</LINE>
<LINE>Now get thee hence, the King, thou know&#8217;st, is coming.</LINE>
<LINE>If thou be found by me, thou art but dead.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If I depart from thee, I cannot live,</LINE>
<LINE>And in thy sight to die, what were it else</LINE>
<LINE>But like a pleasant slumber in thy lap?</LINE>
<LINE>Here could I breathe my soul into the air,</LINE>
<LINE>As mild and gentle as the cradle-babe</LINE>
<LINE>Dying with mother&#8217;s dug between its lips;</LINE>
<LINE>Where, from thy sight, I should be raging mad,</LINE>
<LINE>And cry out for thee to close up mine eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>To have thee with thy lips to stop my mouth;</LINE>
<LINE>So shouldst thou either turn my flying soul,</LINE>
<LINE>Or I should breathe it so into thy body,</LINE>
<LINE>And then it liv&#8217;d in sweet Elysium.</LINE>
<LINE>To die by thee were but to die in jest,</LINE>
<LINE>From thee to die were torture more than death.</LINE>
<LINE>O, let me stay, befall what may befall!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Away! though parting be a fretful corrosive,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LIEU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The gaudy, blabbing, and remorseful day</LINE>
<LINE>Is crept into the bosom of the sea;</LINE>
<LINE>And now loud-howling wolves arouse the jades</LINE>
<LINE>That drag the tragic melancholy night;</LINE>
<LINE>Who with their drowsy, slow, and flagging wings</LINE>
<LINE>Cleep dead men&#8217;s graves, and from their misty jaws</LINE>
<LINE>Breathe foul contagious darkness in the air.</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore bring forth the soldiers of our prize,</LINE>
<LINE>For whilst our pinnace anchors in the Downs,</LINE>
<LINE>Here shall they make their ransom on the sand,</LINE>
<LINE>Or with their blood stain this discolored shore.</LINE>
<LINE>Master, this prisoner freely give I thee,</LINE>
<LINE>And thou that art his mate, make boot of this;</LINE>
<LINE>The other, Walter Whitmore, is thy share.</LINE>

<LINE>Against the senseless winds shall grin in vain,</LINE>
<LINE>Who in contempt shall hiss at thee again;</LINE>
<LINE>And wedded be thou to the hags of hell,</LINE>
<LINE>For daring to affy a mighty lord</LINE>
<LINE>Unto the daughter of a worthless king,</LINE>
<LINE>Having neither subject, wealth, nor diadem.</LINE>
<LINE>By devilish policy art thou grown great,</LINE>
<LINE>And like ambitious Sylla, overgorg&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>With gobbets of thy mother&#8217;s bleeding heart.</LINE>
<LINE>By thee Anjou and Maine were sold to France.</LINE>
<LINE>The false revolting Normans thorough thee</LINE>
<LINE>Disdain to call us lord, and Picardy</LINE>
<LINE>Hath slain their governors, surpris&#8217;d our forts,</LINE>

<LINE>The princely Warwick, and the Nevils all,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose dreadful swords were never drawn in vain,</LINE>
<LINE>As hating thee, are rising up in arms;</LINE>
<LINE>And now the house of York, thrust from the crown</LINE>
<LINE>By shameful murder of a guiltless king</LINE>
<LINE>And lofty, proud, encroaching tyranny,</LINE>
<LINE>Burns with revenging fire, whose hopeful colors</LINE>
<LINE>Advance our half-fac&#8217;d sun, striving to shine,</LINE>

<LINE>The commons here in Kent are up in arms,</LINE>

<SPEAKER>CADE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, that I mean to do. Is not this a lamentable thing, that of the skin of an innocent lamb should be made parchment? that parchment, being scribbled o&#8217;er, should undo a man? Some say the bee stings, but I say, &#8217;tis the bee&#8217;s wax; for I did but seal once to a thing, and I was never mine own man since. How now? Who&#8217;s there?</LINE>

<LINE>Rebellious hinds, the filth and scum of Kent,</LINE>

<LINE>As for these silken-coated slaves, I pass not,</LINE>
<LINE>It is to you, good people, that I speak,</LINE>

<LINE>Villain, thy father was a plasterer,</LINE>

<LINE>And what of that?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CADE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, this: Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March,</LINE>
<LINE>Married the Duke of Clarence&#8217; daughter, did he not?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>STAF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CADE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By her he had two children at one birth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That&#8217;s false.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CADE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, there&#8217;s the question; but I say, &#8217;tis true.</LINE>
<LINE>The elder of them, being put to nurse,</LINE>
<LINE>Was by a beggar-woman stol&#8217;n away,</LINE>
<LINE>And ignorant of his birth and parentage,</LINE>
<LINE>Became a bricklayer when he came to age.</LINE>
<LINE>His son am I, deny it if you can.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DICK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, &#8217;tis too true; therefore he shall be king.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SMITH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, he made a chimney in my father&#8217;s house, and the bricks are alive at this day to testify it; therefore deny it not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>STAF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And will you credit this base drudge&#8217;s words,</LINE>
<LINE>That speaks he knows not what?</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, marry, will we; therefore get ye gone.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>BRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Jack Cade, the Duke of York hath taught you this.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CADE.</SPEAKER>
<STAGEDIR>Aside.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>He lies, for I invented it myself.&#8212;Go to, sirrah, tell the King from me, that, for his father&#8217;s sake, Henry the Fifth (in whose time boys went to span-counter for French crowns), I am content he shall reign, but I&#8217;ll be Protector over him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DICK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And furthermore, we&#8217;ll have the Lord Say&#8217;s head for selling the dukedom of Maine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CADE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And good reason; for thereby is England main&#8217;d, and fain to go with a staff, but that my puissance holds it up. Fellow kings, I tell you that that Lord Say hath gelded the commonwealth, and made it an eunuch; and more than that, he can speak French, and therefore he is a traitor.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>STAF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O gross and miserable ignorance!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CADE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, answer if you can. The Frenchmen are our enemies. Go to then, I ask but this: can he that speaks with the tongue of an enemy be a good counsellor, or no?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, no, and therefore we&#8217;ll have his head.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, seeing gentle words will not prevail,</LINE>
<LINE>Assail them with the army of the King.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>STAF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Herald, away, and throughout every town</LINE>
<LINE>Proclaim them traitors that are up with Cade,</LINE>
<LINE>That those which fly before the battle ends</LINE>
<LINE>May, even in their wives&#8217; and children&#8217;s sight,</LINE>
<LINE>Be hang&#8217;d up for example at their doors.</LINE>

</SPEECH>
<STAGEDIR>Exit with his Brother and Men.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>And you that love the commons, follow me.</LINE>
<LINE>Now show yourselves men, &#8217;tis for liberty.</LINE>
<LINE>We will not leave one lord, one gentleman;</LINE>
<LINE>Spare none but such as go in clouted shoon,</LINE>

<LINE>They are all in order, and march toward us.</LINE>

<LINE>Well, he shall be beheaded for it ten times. Ah, thou say, thou serge, nay, thou buckram lord! now art thou within point-blank of our jurisdiction regal. What canst thou answer to my Majesty for giving up of Normandy unto Mounsieur Basimecu, the Dauphin of France? Be it known unto thee by these presence, even the presence of Lord Mortimer, that I am the besom that must sweep the court clean of such filth as thou art. Thou hast most traitorously corrupted the youth of the realm in erecting a grammar school; and whereas, before, our forefathers had no other books but the score and the tally, thou hast caus&#8217;d printing to be us&#8217;d, and, contrary to the King, his crown, and dignity, thou hast built a paper-mill. It will be prov&#8217;d to thy face that thou hast men about thee that usually talk of a noun and a verb, and such abominable words as no Christian ear can endure to hear. Thou hast appointed justices of peace, to call poor men before them about matters they were not able to answer. Moreover, thou hast put them in prison, and because they could not read, thou hast hang&#8217;d them, when, indeed, only for that cause they have been most worthy to live. Thou dost ride in a foot-cloth, dost thou not?</LINE>

Wherefore, on a brick wall have I climb&#8217;d into this garden, to see if I can eat grass, or pick a sallet another while, which is not amiss to cool a man&#8217;s stomach this hot weather. And I think this word &#8217;sallet&#8217; was born to do me good; for many a time, but for a sallet, my brain-pan had been cleft with a brown bill; and many a time, when I have been dry and bravely marching, it hath serv&#8217;d me instead of a quart pot to drink in; and now the word &#8217;sallet&#8217; must serve me to feed on.</LINE>

<LINE>Is&#8217;t not enough to break into my garden,</LINE>
<LINE>And like a thief to come to rob my grounds,</LINE>
<LINE>Climbing my walls in spite of me the owner,</LINE>
<LINE>But thou wilt brave me with these saucy terms?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CADE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Brave thee? Ay, by the best blood that ever was broach&#8217;d, and beard thee too. Look on me well. I have eat no meat these five days, yet come thou and thy five men, and if I do not leave you all as dead as a doornail, I pray God I may never eat grass more.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IDEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, it shall ne&#8217;er be said, while England stands,</LINE>
<LINE>That Alexander Iden, an esquire of Kent,</LINE>
<LINE>Took odds to combat a poor famish&#8217;d man.</LINE>
<LINE>Oppose thy steadfast-gazing eyes to mine,</LINE>
<LINE>See if thou canst outface me with thy looks.</LINE>
<LINE>Set limb to limb, and thou art far the lesser;</LINE>
<LINE>Thy hand is but a finger to my fist,</LINE>
<LINE>Thy leg a stick compared with this truncheon;</LINE>
<LINE>My foot shall fight with all the strength thou hast,</LINE>
<LINE>And if mine arm be heaved in the air,</LINE>
<LINE>Thy grave is digg&#8217;d already in the earth.</LINE>
<LINE>As for words, whose greatness answers words,</LINE>
<LINE>Let this my sword report what speech forbears.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CADE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By my valor, the most complete champion that ever I heard! Steel, if thou turn the edge, or cut not out the burly-bon&#8217;d clown in chines of beef ere thou sleep in thy sheath, I beseech God on my knees thou mayst be turn&#8217;d to hobnails.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Here they fight and Cade falls down.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>O, I am slain! Famine and no other hath slain me. Let ten thousand devils come against me, and give me but the ten meals I have lost, and I&#8217;d defy them all. Wither, garden, and be henceforth a burying-place to all that do dwell in this house, because the unconquer&#8217;d soul of Cade is fled.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IDEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is&#8217;t Cade that I have slain, that monstrous traitor?</LINE>
<LINE>Sword, I will hallow thee for this thy deed,</LINE>
<LINE>And hang thee o&#8217;er my tomb when I am dead.</LINE>
<LINE>Ne&#8217;er shall this blood be wiped from thy point,</LINE>
<LINE>But thou shalt wear it as a herald&#8217;s coat,</LINE>
<LINE>To emblaze the honor that thy master got.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CADE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Iden, farewell, and be proud of thy victory. Tell Kent from me, she hath lost her best man, and exhort all the world to be cowards; for I, that never fear&#8217;d any, am vanquish&#8217;d by famine, not by valor.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>IDEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How much thou wrong&#8217;st me, heaven be my judge.</LINE>
<LINE>Die, damned wretch, the curse of her that bare thee;</LINE>
<LINE>And as I thrust thy body in with my sword,</LINE>
<LINE>So wish I, I might thrust thy soul to hell.</LINE>
<LINE>Hence will I drag thee headlong by the heels</LINE>
<LINE>Unto a dunghill, which shall be thy grave,</LINE>
<LINE>And there cut off thy most ungracious head,</LINE>
<LINE>Which I will bear in triumph to the King,</LINE>
<LINE>Leaving thy trunk for crows to feed upon.</LINE>

<LINE>To entertain great England&#8217;s lawful king!</LINE>
<LINE>Ah, sancta majestas! who would not buy thee dear?</LINE>

<LINE>This hand was made to handle nought but gold.</LINE>
<LINE>I cannot give due action to my words,</LINE>

<SPEAKER>YORK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Humphrey of Buckingham, I accept thy greeting.</LINE>
<LINE>Art thou a messenger, or come of pleasure?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BUCK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A messenger from Henry, our dread liege,</LINE>
<LINE>To know the reason of these arms in peace;</LINE>
<LINE>Or why thou, being a subject as I am,</LINE>
<LINE>Against thy oath and true allegiance sworn,</LINE>
<LINE>Should raise so great a power without his leave,</LINE>
<LINE>Or dare to bring thy force so near the court.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK.</SPEAKER>
<STAGEDIR>Aside.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Scarce can I speak, my choler is so great.</LINE>
<LINE>O, I could hew up rocks and fight with flint,</LINE>
<LINE>I am so angry at these abject terms;</LINE>
<LINE>And now, like Ajax Telamonius,</LINE>
<LINE>On sheep or oxen could I spend my fury.</LINE>
<LINE>I am far better born than is the King;</LINE>
<LINE>More like a king, more kingly in my thoughts;</LINE>
<LINE>But I must make fair weather yet a while,</LINE>
<LINE>Till Henry be more weak and I more strong.&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Buckingham, I prithee pardon me,</LINE>
<LINE>That I have given no answer all this while;</LINE>
<LINE>My mind was troubled with deep melancholy.</LINE>
<LINE>The cause why I have brought this army hither</LINE>
<LINE>Is to remove proud Somerset from the King,</LINE>
<LINE>Seditious to his Grace and to the state.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BUCK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That is too much presumption on thy part;</LINE>
<LINE>But if thy arms be to no other end,</LINE>
<LINE>The King hath yielded unto thy demand:</LINE>
<LINE>The Duke of Somerset is in the Tower.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Upon thine honor, is he prisoner?</LINE>

<LINE>How now? is Somerset at liberty?</LINE>
<LINE>Then, York, unloose thy long-imprisoned thoughts,</LINE>

<LINE>Shall I endure the sight of Somerset?</LINE>
<LINE>False king, why hast thou broken faith with me,</LINE>
<LINE>Knowing how hardly I can brook abuse?</LINE>
<LINE>King did I call thee? No; thou art not king;</LINE>
<LINE>Not fit to govern and rule multitudes,</LINE>
<LINE>Which dar&#8217;st not, no, nor canst not rule a traitor.</LINE>
<LINE>That head of thine doth not become a crown:</LINE>
<LINE>Thy hand is made to grasp a palmer&#8217;s staff</LINE>

<LINE>That gold must round engirt these brows of mine,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose smile and frown, like to Achilles&#8217; spear,</LINE>
<LINE>Is able with the change to kill and cure.</LINE>
<LINE>Here is a hand to hold a sceptre up,</LINE>

<LINE>And seek for sorrow with thy spectacles?</LINE>
<LINE>O, where is faith? O, where is loyalty?</LINE>
<LINE>If it be banish&#8217;d from the frosty head,</LINE>
<LINE>Where shall it find a harbor in the earth?</LINE>
<LINE>Wilt thou go dig a grave to find out war,</LINE>
<LINE>And shame thine honorable age with blood?</LINE>
<LINE>Why art thou old, and want&#8217;st experience?</LINE>
<LINE>Or wherefore dost abuse it if thou hast it?</LINE>
<LINE>For shame, in duty bend thy knee to me</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is great sin to swear unto a sin,</LINE>
<LINE>But greater sin to keep a sinful oath.</LINE>
<LINE>Who can be bound by any solemn vow</LINE>
<LINE>To do a murd&#8217;rous deed, to rob a man,</LINE>
<LINE>To force a spotless virgin&#8217;s chastity,</LINE>
<LINE>To reave the orphan of his patrimony,</LINE>
<LINE>To wring the widow from her custom&#8217;d right,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Y. CLIF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Shame and confusion! all is on the rout,</LINE>
<LINE>Fear frames disorder, and disorder wounds</LINE>
<LINE>Where it should guard. O war, thou son of hell,</LINE>
<LINE>Whom angry heavens do make their minister,</LINE>
<LINE>Throw in the frozen bosoms of our part</LINE>
<LINE>Hot coals of vengeance! Let no soldier fly.</LINE>
<LINE>He that is truly dedicate to war</LINE>
<LINE>Hath no self-love; nor he that loves himself</LINE>
<LINE>Hath not essentially but by circumstance</LINE>
<LINE>The name of valor.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Sees his dead father.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>O, let the vile world end,</LINE>
<LINE>And the premised flames of the last day</LINE>
<LINE>Knit earth and heaven together!</LINE>
<LINE>Now let the general trumpet blow his blast,</LINE>
<LINE>Particularities and petty sounds</LINE>
<LINE>To cease! Wast thou ordain&#8217;d, dear father,</LINE>
<LINE>To lose thy youth in peace, and to achieve</LINE>
<LINE>The silver livery of advised age,</LINE>
<LINE>And in thy reverence, and thy chair-days, thus</LINE>
<LINE>To die in ruffian battle? Even at this sight</LINE>
<LINE>My heart is turn&#8217;d to stone; and while &#8217;tis mine,</LINE>
<LINE>It shall be stony. York not our old men spares;</LINE>
<LINE>No more will I their babes. Tears virginal</LINE>
<LINE>Shall be to me even as the dew to fire,</LINE>
<LINE>And beauty, that the tyrant oft reclaims,</LINE>
<LINE>Shall to my flaming wrath be oil and flax.</LINE>
<LINE>Henceforth I will not have to do with pity.</LINE>
<LINE>Meet I an infant of the house of York,</LINE>
<LINE>Into as many gobbets will I cut it</LINE>
<LINE>As wild Medea young Absyrtus did;</LINE>
<LINE>In cruelty will I seek out my fame.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>He takes him up on his back.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Come, thou new ruin of old Clifford&#8217;s house:</LINE>
<LINE>As did Aeneas old Anchises bear,</LINE>
<LINE>So bear I thee upon my manly shoulders;</LINE>
<LINE>But then Aeneas bare a living load&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Nothing so heavy as these woes of mine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>
<STAGEDIR>Exit bearing off his father.</STAGEDIR>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Richard and Somerset to fight. Somerset is killed under the sign of the Castle Inn.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So lie thou there;</LINE>
<LINE>For underneath an alehouse&#8217; paltry sign,</LINE>
<LINE>The Castle in Saint Albons, Somerset</LINE>
<LINE>Hath made the wizard famous in his death.</LINE>
<LINE>Sword, hold thy temper; heart, be wrathful still:</LINE>
<LINE>Priests pray for enemies, but princes kill.</LINE>
</SPEECH>
<STAGEDIR>Exit.</STAGEDIR>

<STAGEDIR>Fight. Excursions. Enter King, Queen, and others.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Away, my lord! you are slow, for shame, away!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Can we outrun the heavens? Good Margaret, stay.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What are you made of? You&#8217;ll nor fight nor fly.</LINE>
<LINE>Now is it manhood, wisdom, and defense</LINE>
<LINE>To give the enemy way, and to secure us</LINE>
<LINE>By what we can, which can no more but fly.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Alarum afar off.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>If you be ta&#8217;en, we then should see the bottom</LINE>
<LINE>Of all our fortunes; but if we haply scape</LINE>
<LINE>(As well we may, if not through your neglect),</LINE>
<LINE>We shall to London get, where you are lov&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>And where this breach now in our fortunes made</LINE>
<LINE>May readily be stopp&#8217;d.</LINE>
</SPEECH>
<STAGEDIR>Enter Young Clifford.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Y. CLIF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But that my heart&#8217;s on future mischief set,</LINE>
<LINE>I would speak blasphemy ere bid you fly.</LINE>
<LINE>But fly you must. Uncurable discomfit</LINE>
<LINE>Reigns in the hearts of all our present parts.</LINE>
<LINE>Away, for your relief! and we will live</LINE>
<LINE>To see their day, and them our fortune give.</LINE>
<LINE>Away, my lord, away!</LINE>
</SPEECH>
<STAGEDIR>Exeunt.</STAGEDIR>

<SCENE>
<SCENETITLE>Scene 3</SCENETITLE>
<SCENELOCATION>Fields near St. Alban&#8217;s.</SCENELOCATION>
<SCENEPERSONAE>(York, Richard, Warwick, Soldiers, Salisbury)</SCENEPERSONAE>
<STAGEDIR>Alarum. Retreat. Enter York, Richard, Warwick, and Soldiers with Drum and Colors.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Of Salisbury, who can report of him,</LINE>
<LINE>That winter lion, who in rage forgets</LINE>
<LINE>Aged contusions and all brush of time;</LINE>
<LINE>And like a gallant in the brow of youth,</LINE>
<LINE>Repairs him with occasion? This happy day</LINE>
<LINE>Is not itself, nor have we won one foot,</LINE>
<LINE>If Salisbury be lost.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">My noble father,</LINE>
<LINE>Three times today I holp him to his horse,</LINE>
<LINE>Three times bestrid him; thrice I led him off,</LINE>
<LINE>Persuaded him from any further act:</LINE>
<LINE>But still, where danger was, still there I met him,</LINE>
<LINE>And like rich hangings in a homely house,</LINE>
<LINE>So was his will in his old feeble body.</LINE>
<LINE>But noble as he is, look where he comes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>
<STAGEDIR>Enter Salisbury.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, by my sword, well hast thou fought today;</LINE>
<LINE>By th&#8217; mass, so did we all. I thank you, Richard.</LINE>
<LINE>God knows how long it is I have to live,</LINE>
<LINE>And it hath pleas&#8217;d him that three times today</LINE>
<LINE>You have defended me from imminent death.</LINE>
<LINE>Well, lords, we have not got that which we have:</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis not enough our foes are this time fled,</LINE>
<LINE>Being opposites of such repairing nature.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know our safety is to follow them,</LINE>
<LINE>For, as I hear, the King is fled to London,</LINE>
<LINE>To call a present court of parliament.</LINE>
<LINE>Let us pursue him ere the writs go forth.</LINE>
<LINE>What says Lord Warwick? shall we after them?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>After them! Nay, before them, if we can.</LINE>
<LINE>Now, by my faith, lords, &#8217;twas a glorious day.</LINE>
<LINE>Saint Albons battle won by famous York</LINE>
<LINE>Shall be eterniz&#8217;d in all age to come.</LINE>
<LINE>Sound drum and trumpets, and to London all,</LINE>
<LINE>And more such days as these to us befall!</LINE>
</SPEECH>
<STAGEDIR>Exeunt.</STAGEDIR>
