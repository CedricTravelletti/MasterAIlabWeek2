<personae playtitle="Henry VI, Part 2">

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="KING.">King Henry the Sixth</persname>
<persdescription>King Henry VI, head of the Lancastrian party, is a young, weak, overly pious monarch with absolutely no political sense, who would much rather be in his study reading than having to rule a country, and relies excessively on his councilors. Shy and awkward, his response to everything is to praise God and quote pious clich&#233;s, even when reading a prediction of his own deposition. He is overborne by his wife Margaret and oblivious to her love for Suffolk. His greatest desire is for peace between all his noblemen and his subjects, but his pleading has little effect. He has full trust in Gloucester, and follows his lead in everything until the latter is tossed out by the other members of the nobility. Despite his conviction of Gloucester&#8217;s innocence, Henry does not have the strength to go against the will of all the other noblemen and the Queen. The extent of his reliance on Gloucester is such that he faints on learning of the Duke&#8217;s death. He is easily bullied, though he strives for justice at all times and comes to recognize that he is not as good a ruler as he should be. He is baffled and disconcerted when York denies his claim to the throne. A determined pacifist in a court of combative, violent enemies, he is a sympathetic figure, if only because he is so utterly out of his depth. His further adventures are chronicled in <persnameref>Henry VI, Part Three</persnameref>.</persdescription>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="GLOU.">Duke of Gloucester</persname>
<persdescription>The Duke of Gloucester is the King&#8217;s uncle, the brother of Henry V, and Lord Protector of the realm, the same character as in <persnameref>Henry VI, Part One</persnameref>. He is a good man, beloved by the people, and doing his best under trying circumstances. He can be haughty, however, and sometimes needs to lash out and be heard; his care for England is shocked and insulted by the terms of the King&#8217;s marriage treaty, and he makes his opinion known. He is aware of his tendency to lose his temper, and out of self-control prefers to remove himself from a room before he says or does anything unforgivable. He loves his wife Eleanor greatly, though he is worried at her ambitions; despite his love his regard for justice will not allow him to help her when she is condemned, though partly this is because he knows that his public position is precarious and that helping her would harm him. He is a worried man who feels the weight of his duties strongly, though he is still wily and able to see through Simpcox&#8217;s trick easily. Deposed by the nobility&#8217;s coup, he suspects all too well what will follow his disgrace. He is an old man with a large, cared-for beard.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="CAR.">Cardinal Beauford</persname>
<persdescription>Cardinal Beauford is the same as the Bishop of Winchester of <persnameref>Henry VI, Part One</persnameref>, King Henry&#8217;s illegitimate great-uncle, a wily, hypocritical priest who masks his hatred of his nephew Gloucester behind piety. He attempts to undermine the Duke at all times, under the pretence of safeguarding the kingdom. He joins with Suffolk to bring down Gloucester&#8217;s wife by setting her up to be caught consulting a magician, and is one of the masterminds of the coup that brings Gloucester down. Appointed Gloucester&#8217;s jailer, he facilitates his nephew&#8217;s death. On his deathbed, all of his sins come back to him, and he begins to rave in fear of death, terrified of what awaits him. Few people trust him, for good reason.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="YORK.">Richard Plantagenet, Duke of York</persname>
<persdescription>The Duke of York, head of the Yorkist party, is the Richard Plantagenet of <perstitleref>Henry VI, Part One</perstitleref>, an English nobleman convinced that his claim to the throne is better than King Henry&#8217;s. He is a proud and ambitious man who aims to make himself King, and is ready to take actions he knows to be of questionable morality to do so. He joins in the plot against the Duchess of Gloucester, is a prime mover of the coup that overthrows Gloucester himself, and he urges Cade to rebel for the sake of seeing what popular opinion will think of a challenge to Henry&#8217;s rule and providing an excuse to bring his army home, no matter the cost to the country. Leaving aside the question of Henry&#8217;s right to the throne, York despises him as being unfit to wear the crown. He has an ongoing feud with Somerset and Suffolk, but joins with the latter to plot Gloucester&#8217;s death. Sent to Ireland to put down a rebellion, he leaps at the chance to raise an army, and having subdued the Irish uses it to push his claims in England. Though he attempts to present himself as a loyal subject for as long as possible, the longer he spends as a mere subject the more enraged he grows, and seeing Somerset at liberty after being told he had been imprisoned proves the final straw, and he openly announces his rebellion, despite having only the Nevilles (Salisbury and Warwick) on his side, along with his sons Edward and Richard. His revolt leads to the battle of Saint Albans, which he wins; the rest of his career can be found in <perstitleref>Henry VI, Part Three</perstitleref>.</persdescription>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="EDW.">Edward Earl of March</persname>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="RICH.">Richard Plantagenet</persname>
<persdescription>Richard Plantagenet, of the Yorkist party, is the Duke of York&#8217;s third son and the leader of one portion of his army. He is a loyal son and an able soldier, killing Somerset personally. He is a hunchback with an excellent sense of repartee. His further adventures are chronicled in <persnameref>Henry VI, Part Three</persnameref>.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="SOM.">Duke of Somerset</persname>
<persdescription>The Duke of Somerset, of the Lancastrian party, is one of the younger members of the English nobility, who has an ongoing feud with the Duke of York (see <persnameref>Henry VI, Part One</persnameref>) and dislikes the Duke of Gloucester. He joins with the Cardinal to help overthrow the latter, but also makes plans with Buckingham to rid themselves of the Cardinal as well. Named Regent of the English possessions in France, he is badly beaten by the French. His proximity to the King on his return provides an excuse for York to return with his army from Ireland; Somerset agrees to put himself into custody to calm York down, but his appearance at liberty drives the Duke to openly publish his rebellion. His further adventures are chronicled in <persnameref>Henry VI, Part Three</persnameref>.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="SUF.">Duke of Suffolk</persname>
<persdescription>Duke of Suffolk (William de la Pole), of the Lancastrian party, is an English nobleman who fell passionately in love with Margaret when he met her, and being unable to wed her as he was already married, arranged for her to marry King Henry so he could keep her close (see <persnameref>Henry VI, Part One</persnameref>). In doing so he agreed to extremely disadvantageous terms for England in the treaty between England and Margaret&#8217;s father. He is a masculine, seductive man, but also a conniving, power-hungry courtier, and insanely prideful and disdainful of common people. He detests both Gloucester and the Duke of York, and schemes to bring about their downfalls. He is willing to partner with his enemies to bring down another one, and joins with York to arrange for Gloucester&#8217;s death. Having already arranged for the Duchess of Gloucester&#8217;s trafficking with magicians, and for her discovery, he also takes the murder of Gloucester into his own hands. He is unable to face down Warwick&#8217;s accusations, however, and is banished. He is hated by the people for what he has done to national prestige and for killing the Duke; even pirates despise him, and execute him on finding out who he is. His head then spends a great deal of time being fondled by Margaret.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="BUCK.">Duke of Buckingham</persname>
<persdescription>The Duke of Buckingham is an English nobleman who dislikes the duke of Gloucester and aims to replace him. Though he joins with the Cardinal to try and dislodge him, arguing that the King is old enough to reign on his own, he in fact aims to simply replace Gloucester as Protector, leaving the Cardinal behind. Part of the plot against Gloucester&#8217;s Duchess, he is one of those who arrests her for consulting magicians. He helps Clifford to put down Cade&#8217;s rebellion by promising to pardon the rebels, and becomes one of the King&#8217;s chief councilors, sent to parley with York when the latter brings his army back from Ireland. Despite his personal ambitions, he is loyal to the King and not unkind to the common folk.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="CLIF.">Lord Clifford</persname>
<persdescription>Lord Clifford, of the Lancastrian party, is an old nobleman highly loyal to the King. He is sent with Buckingham to convince Cade&#8217;s followers to abandon their rebellion, and twice manages to win them over by his speeches. When York insists that he is the rightful King, all Clifford can think is that York has gone mad, and he has no qualms about recommending his immediate execution. He is Henry&#8217;s main defender against the Yorkist forces. He is an excellent fighter, but York has the better of him. His final thought is that how one dies is more important than the fact of dying.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="Y. CLIF.">Young Clifford</persname>
<persdescription>Young Clifford, of the Lancastrian party, is Lord Clifford&#8217;s son. He loves his father dearly and follows his lead in insulting the Duke of York and his family when the latter claims the throne. The death of his father strikes him hard, and he swears to have revenge. Where this oath leads him can be discovered in <persnameref>Henry VI, Part Three</persnameref>.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="SAL.">Earl of Salisbury</persname>
<persaliases>
	<persname short="BOTH. WAR. AND SAL.">Both Salisbury and Warwick</persname>
</persaliases>
<persdescription>The Earl of Salisbury, of the Yorkist party, is the Earl of Warwick&#8217;s father and an old nobleman whose chief care is for the good of the realm. He at first prefers to support the Duke of Gloucester against the machinations of the Cardinal and Somerset for that reason. He is convinced by York and Warwick&#8217;s arguments as to York&#8217;s right to the crown, and swears to help bring him to the throne, though that means abandoning Gloucester to his fate. He has the common touch and is able to parley with a mob. Despite his age, he is a fierce fighter. His family crest is a bear chained to a staff.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="WAR.">Earl of Warwick</persname>
<persaliases>
	<persname short="BOTH. WAR. AND SAL.">Both Salisbury and Warwick</persname>
</persaliases>
<persdescription>The Earl of Warwick, of the Yorkist party, is Salisbury&#8217;s son and a supporter of the Duke of York. A great fighter, he is horrified and enraged when the counties he won by battle in France are handed back over without any form of compensation as part of King Henry&#8217;s marriage treaty. His temper often gets him into trouble, as he bursts out whatever thoughts he has without regard for his place. He is quick to accept York&#8217;s claim to the throne as valid. He is convinced that Gloucester was murdered when he sees the Duke&#8217;s corpse, and opportunistically rouses the commons to riot as a way of getting rid of Suffolk. Insulted by Clifford, he swears to kill him personally at Saint Albans, but recognizes York&#8217;s superior claim. His further adventures are chronicled in <persnameref>Henry VI, Part Three</persnameref>.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persname short="SCALES.">Lord Scales</persname>

</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="SAY.">Lord Say</persname>
<persdescription>Lord Say is mistakenly believed by Cade&#8217;s rebels to be responsible for the losses in France, partly because he can speak French; he is also hated for heavy taxation. He nobly refuses to follow the King to safety at Killingworth, so as to not attract the rebels against the King there. He is a well-educated man, a diplomat and judge rather than a warrior, none of which do him any favors when he is captured. Despite all his pleading, he is executed, and his head used as a trophy and battle-standard by Cade&#8217;s men.</persdescription>

He is shocked to find a starving man stealing from his garden, particularly when the man insults him. Though essentially peaceful, Iden will not bear a slur on his honor, and challenges the man to fight. Only after killing him does he discover that his enemy is Cade, and he is delighted to have made an end of the rabble-rouser. He brings Cade&#8217;s head to the King and is knighted for the deed.</persdescription>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="CADE.">Jack Cade</persname>
<persdescription>Jack Cade is a Kentishman who has served the Duke of York and is set by him to rise a rebellion against King Henry under the name of John Mortimer. Cade takes his instructions a bit too seriously, and soon develops excessive delusions of grandeur. He is a good leader, though, or at least an excellent rabble-rouser, able to convince his men to follow him in a plan that is the establishment&#8217;s worst nightmare of a lower-class rebellion: all to be equal, property (including wives) to be communal, and books to be burnt. Resolutely anti-intellectual, Cade kills anyone who can read, burns all the records, and uses evidence of education as a good excuse to die. While preaching equality, he insists on being treated as a king, soon having those who don&#8217;t killed. Though he occasionally gets a sense of how insane his actions are, he soon gets past that. His idea of power is to be able to eat and drink as much as he likes and the right to sleep with any woman he wishes to. Despite the fact that he is almost mad, he is sensible enough to flee when things go against him. On the verge of starving to death while in hiding, he tries to rob a garden and is killed by a man who does not even know who he is.</persdescription>

<persname short="DICK.">Dick the Butcher</persname>
<persdescription>Dick the Butcher is a large, physically powerful man, essentially Cade&#8217;s second-in-command, though he clearly does not believe a word of Cade&#8217;s claims to noble blood, or misunderstands Cade&#8217;s intentions entirely, as he tries to build up Cade&#8217;s credibility by pointing out what a criminal he is. He joins the rebellion for the joy of anarchy, a chance to kill lawyers and have his way with women. He enjoys killing. In the end, he is easily swayed and convinced to abandon Cade.</persdescription>

Ambitious and prideful, she considers her husband rather weak, and wishes that he would put his nephew aside and become King himself. She is haughty and looks down on Queen Margaret, who is poorer and less well-dressed than she is. She also sees Margaret&#8217;s character clearly, though she lacks the ability to see her own faults. In her ambition she takes the dangerous step of consulting a fortune-teller, not realizing that she has been set up, and is arrested for the illegal act of forecasting the King&#8217;s fate. As a noblewoman, she is spared death, but is publicly humiliated before being banished.</persdescription>

Besides, she is deeply in love with Suffolk, who arranged for her marriage in the first place (see Henry VI Part One). A prideful woman, she cannot stomach the Duchess of Gloucester&#8217;s high-and-mighty airs, nor the Duke of Gloucester&#8217;s control of government, and she soon joins the court intrigues to bring them down, aiming to set her husband firmly in control of the country. As she herself can easily bully the King, she will therefore rule herself. Intelligent and cunning, she has a strong temper, but is also capable of coldly plotting an enemy&#8217;s death. She stiffens Henry&#8217;s spine as they are defeated in battle by York. Her further adventures are chronicled in <persnameref>Henry VI, Part Three</persnameref>.</persdescription>

<scenepersonae>(King Henry, Duke Humphrey of Gloucester, Salisbury, Warwick, Cardinal Beauford, Queen, Suffolk, York, Somerset, Buckingham)</scenepersonae>
<scenedescription>Suffolk presents to King Henry VI, Princess Margaret, whom he married by proxy for the King, and the terms of the peace with France, concluded at the same time, to last eighteen months. Gloucester reads the terms aloud, but drops the paper when he comes to the part about losing Anjou and Maine. Cardinal Beaufort (Winchester) continues, the terms being the transfer of Anjou and Maine to King Regnier, Margaret&#8217;s father, and the travelling of the Queen at Henry&#8217;s expense, and the marriage to be without dowry. After the King, Queen, and Suffolk leave Gloucester speaks passionately about the losses, seconded by Warwick and York. The Cardinal tries to calm them, but Gloucester breaks out and, referring to their long-standing enmity, leaves in a rage. The Cardinal speaks against him after he goes, pointing out that Gloucester is hot-tempered, heir to the throne, and very popular with the common people. He recommends that the Duke be curbed, and Somerset and Buckingham agree, thought after he leaves they agree that the Cardinal bears watching, too, and decide that one of them should be Protector instead of either Duke or Cardinal. Salisbury, considering the good of the realm rather than private ambition, recruits his son Warwick and Richard Duke of York to help support Gloucester. Left alone, York considers how the Kingdom is his by right, and all the wounds made to it therefore hurt him more than the others. He plans to wait until Henry is distracted by his marriage and Gloucester busy fighting with the other noblemen to stake his claim to the throne.</scenedescription>

<scenepersonae>(Duke Humphrey of Gloucester, Eleanor the Duchess, First Royal Messenger, Hume)</scenepersonae>
<scenedescription>Humphrey of Gloucester tells his wife Eleanor of a disquieting dream I which he saw his staff of office being broken, and the heads of Somerset and Suffolk placed on the broken parts. She interprets it as the death of those who seek to upset him, and tells her dream of sovereignty; but he is angry with her for such ambition. He leaves to accompany the King on a hawking trip. Eleanor calls in Sir John Hume, a priest, who flatters her with the title of Majesty, and says he has arranged with Margery Jourdain, a witch, and Roger Bolingbroke, a conjurer, to help her. She gives him gold and leaves. He considers how he is in the pay of the Cardinal and Suffolk to undermine Eleanor and so overthrow Gloucester, and that though he recognizes it as ill practice, he can&#8217;t deny he&#8217;s well-paid.</scenedescription>

<scenepersonae>(Petitioners, Peter, Suffolk, Queen, King, Duke Humphrey of Gloucester, Cardinal, Buckingham, York, Somerset, Salisbury, Warwick, Duchess of Gloucester)</scenepersonae>
<scenedescription>Petitioners who have come to hand in their complaints to Gloucester are met by the Queen and Suffolk instead, who take and read them. One finds himself in trouble when Suffolk reads a petition attacking him. Another, Peter, is taken away for petitioning against his master&#8217;s treason in claiming that York is the right heir to the throne. The incensed Queen tears the others up, disdaining the commoners, and the petitioners leave. Margaret rails against the King&#8217;s weakness and pusillanimity, against Gloucester&#8217;s power and his wife Eleanor&#8217;s insolence. Suffolk implores her to still side with the Cardinal, no matter how much she dislikes him, until they have brought Gloucester down, explaining that he has put together a plot against Eleanor. The court enters, with York and Somerset quarrelling over who should be Regent in France. Gloucester&#8217;s power is seen to be slipping when all present turn on him and he has to leave and walk around the block to calm himself down. The Queen drops her fan and hits Eleanor for not picking it up; Eleanor leaves in a fury, warning King Henry that his wife is going to lead him by the nose. Gloucester returns and casts his vote for York as Regent in France; Suffolk attempts to argue against him, and brings in Peter and his master Horner. Peter insists that Horner claimed York was rightful heir to the throne. York is angered and begs that Horner be punished; Gloucester judges that the two men should fight in single combat, and that Somerset should be Regent, as York is now under suspicion.</scenedescription>

In the end Gloucester and the Cardinal agree to personal combat, though they hide it from the King. Commoners enter, crying out that a miracle has taken place: a blind man has been cured. The King is delighted at this evidence of God&#8217;s goodness, but Gloucester quickly exposes the man as a fraud and has him and his wife whipped out of town; the man&#8217;s wife pleads that they did it only out of need. Buckingham enters with the news of Eleanor&#8217;s arrest; shaken, Gloucester abandons his project of fighting with the Cardinal. He insists on his personal loyalty to the King, and announces that he banishes Eleanor from his presence.</scenedescription>

<scenedescription>King Henry pronounces sentence on Eleanor and her accomplices, sparing Eleanor&#8217;s life but forcing her to do public penance and then to be banished to the Isle of Man.

<scenepersonae>(Heralds, King, Queen, Cardinal, Suffolk, York, Buckingham, Salisbury, Warwick, Somerset, Gloucester, Post)</scenepersonae>
<scenedescription>The King is surprised that Gloucester is late for the Parliament meeting, as this is not his custom, and the Queen takes the opportunity to lash out at the Duke. She is seconded by Suffolk, the Cardinal, and York. Henry refuses to agree with them. Somerset enters and announces that all is lost in France. This only sharpens York&#8217;s resolve to take over. Gloucester enters, apologizing for his lateness, and is instantly arrested for high treason by Suffolk. He defends himself against all charges, and the King is sympathetic, but he is nevertheless given into the Cardinal&#8217;s custody after he directly confronts his accusers. Henry sees that Gloucester is innocent, but is too weak to control the nobles, and he leaves in tears. Margaret, the Cardinal, Suffolk and York agree to have Gloucester murdered. News is brought of an uprising in Ireland; York tauntingly suggests that Somerset, ever-so-successful in France, be sent there as well. Suffolk and the Cardinal give York the commission instead, insisting that there&#8217;s no need to involve the King in the decision. Left alone, York reflects that all his plans lacked was an army, and now the government itself is giving him one. Further, he has found a man, Jack Cade, who resembles the dead Mortimer, from whom his claim to the throne descends, and has suborned him to stir up a rebellion while pretending to be that Mortimer, so that York can gauge public reaction to the Yorkist claim to the crown. York envisages that once Cade has done the dirty work, he will be able to return from Ireland with his army and mop things up.</scenedescription>

<line form="verse">By wicked means to frame our sovereign&#8217;s fall.</line>
<line form="verse">Smooth runs the water where the brook is deep,</line>
<line form="verse">And in his simple show he harbors treason.</line>

<line form="verse">My brain, more busy than the laboring spider,</line>
<line form="verse">Weaves tedious snares to trap mine enemies.</line>
<line form="verse">Well, nobles, well; &#8217;tis politicly done,</line>

<line form="verse">I take it kindly. Yet be well assur&#8217;d</line>
<line form="verse">You put sharp weapons in a madman&#8217;s hands.</line>
<line form="verse">Whiles I in Ireland nourish a mighty band,</line>
<line form="verse">I will stir up in England some black storm</line>

<line form="verse">John Cade of Ashford,</line>
<line form="verse">To make commotion, as full well he can,</line>
<line form="verse">Under the title of John Mortimer.</line>
<line form="verse">In Ireland have I seen this stubborn Cade</line>
<line form="verse">Oppose himself against a troop of kerns,</line>
<line form="verse">And fought so long, till that his thighs with darts</line>
<line form="verse">Were almost like a sharp-quill&#8217;d porpentine;</line>
<line form="verse">And in the end being rescued, I have seen</line>
<line form="verse">Him caper upright like a wild Morisco,</line>
<line form="verse">Shaking the bloody darts as he his bells.</line>
<line form="verse">Full often, like a shag-hair&#8217;d crafty kern,</line>
<line form="verse">Hath he conversed with the enemy,</line>
<line form="verse">And undiscover&#8217;d come to me again,</line>
<line form="verse">And given me notice of their villainies.</line>
<line form="verse">This devil here shall be my substitute;</line>
<line form="verse">For that John Mortimer, which now is dead,</line>
<line form="verse">In face, in gait, in speech, he doth resemble.</line>
<line form="verse">By this I shall perceive the commons&#8217; mind,</line>
<line form="verse">How they affect the house and claim of York.</line>
<line form="verse">Say he be taken, rack&#8217;d, and tortured,</line>
<line form="verse">I know no pain they can inflict upon him</line>
<line form="verse">Will make him say I mov&#8217;d him to those arms.</line>
<line form="verse">Say that he thrive, as &#8217;tis great like he will,</line>
<line form="verse">Why then from Ireland come I with my strength,</line>
<line form="verse">And reap the harvest which that rascal sow&#8217;d.</line>
<line form="verse">For Humphrey being dead, as he shall be,</line>

<scenetitle>Scene 2</scenetitle>
<scenelocation>Bury St. Edmund&#8217;s. A palace room of state.</scenelocation>
<scenepersonae>(Murderers, Suffolk, King, Queen, Cardinal, Somerset, Attendants, Warwick, Salisbury, Gloucester, Vaux, First Commoner)</scenepersonae>
<scenedescription>The murderers report to Suffolk that they have done their job and Gloucester is dead. The King and the court enter, prepared for Gloucester&#8217;s trial; when Suffolk, pretending shock, reports that he is dead, Henry faints. Awakening, he makes clear his suspicions of Suffolk&#8217;s guilt and his grief at his uncle&#8217;s death. Margaret protests, suggesting that she too might be accused of the Duke&#8217;s death, and laments her unhappy state. Warwick comes in, warning that the people have heard that Gloucester is dead and are rioting in response. Going in to see the body, he is convinced that Gloucester was murdered, and points to the various signs of his having been strangled. He openly accuses Suffolk and the Cardinal of murder. Warwick and Suffolk go out to fight, but the mob sets upon Suffolk instead, yelling for his blood, and he is forced to take refuge inside. Salisbury enters and brings the mob&#8217;s demand that Suffolk be banished; pretentious Suffolk sneers at the commoners, but the King banishes him all the same. Margaret tries to plead for Suffolk, but for once Henry loses his temper and orders her to keep her tongue. She curses him as he leaves, then takes her leave of Suffolk, both lamenting. She assures him she will work to bring him back, while he insists her presence is all he needs for happiness. News comes that the Cardinal is at point of death. The queen and Suffolk part as if to their deaths.</scenedescription>

<scenedescription>Suffolk and his accompanying gentlemen have been captured in a seafight with pirates. The others are ransomed by their captors, but Walter Whitmore, who has charge of Suffolk, lost an eye in the fight and is determined that his captive shall die in retaliation. Hearing Whitmore&#8217;s name of Walter (pronounced ‘water&#8217;), Suffolk is scared, reminded of the spirit&#8217;s prophecy, but reassures himself and haughtily identifies himself, believing his rank will save him. Unfortunately for him, he is loathed by the common people, and the Lieutenant vomits up that loathing on him before sending him off to die. Stubbornly proud, Suffolk remains scornful and arrogant, finally comparing himself to Julius Caesar and Pompey the Great as he is carried off. One of the ransomed gentlemen decides to take Suffolk&#8217;s body to the Queen.</scenedescription>

<scenedescription>Jack Cade harangues his mob of laborers, who follow him even though they do not believe his grandiose claims to be the proper heir to the throne. He proclaims the terms of his utopia, where all will be cheap and readily available and all lawyers will die. A clerk is brought in and condemned to death for confessing that he can read and write. When Cade hears that Sir Humphrey Stafford and his brother are heading the King&#8217;s troops against him, he quickly knights himself. The Staffords parley with him, mocking his claims of noble birth and accusing him of being in York&#8217;s pay. He denies this. As the people will not be calmed, the Staffords have them all proclaimed traitors and make ready to attack them.</scenedescription>

Hearing that Somerset, his excuse, has been imprisoned, York dismisses his army.

The Queen enters with Somerset, and York, seeing his enemy at liberty despite of promises, bursts out at the King, denying his title and claiming the throne. Somerset arrests him for high treason, but York calls for his sons as bail. The Queen sends for Clifford.  The York boys enter with their armies and Clifford with his, and both sides defy each other.
