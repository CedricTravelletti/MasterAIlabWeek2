<persname short="POR.">Portia</persname>
<persdescription>Portia is the daughter of Cato and the wife of Brutus. She is proud of both of these, and is the definition of a stoic Roman woman. Highly intelligent, she cannot be fobbed off by Brutus&#8217;s excuses, as she knows him too well. She insists on sharing all that she can of his life. She is worried about him and his intentions, and when Brutus leaves for the Capitol intent on killing Caesar, she is a nervous wreck. When civil war breaks out and she realizes the strength of Brutus&#8217;s enemy, she commits suicide.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="female">
<persname short="CAL.">Calphurnia</persname>
<persdescription>Calphurnia is Caesar&#8217;s wife. She is barren, which Caesar hopes will be cured during the race at Lupercal if Antony touches her as he passes by. She is disturbed by bad dreams the night before Caesar&#8217;s death, premonitory nightmares which cause her to cry out in fear in her sleep. Though she has never trusted in premonitions before, she attempts to keep Caesar from going to the Capitol, convinced that it would mean his death. She is partly successful, but Decius&#8217;s re-interpretation of her dream carries more force with Caesar, who leaves with his murderers.</persdescription>

</persaliases>
<persdescription>Messala is a messenger in Brutus&#8217;s army. He brings the news of the massacre of Senators perpetrated by the triumvirate.

<persdescription>Soothsayer warns Caesar of the Ides of March, without giving any further details, being thereby accounted a dreamer.

For this he is arrested and never heard from again.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="CIN.">Cinna</persname>
<persdescription>Cinna is one of the conspirators against Caesar. He has a distinct way of walking. He leaves one of the anonymous letters for Brutus, and is one of the more enthusiastic killers. An unfortunate poet with his name is torn to pieces by a mob instead of him.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="CIN. POET.">Cinna, a Poet</persname>
<persdescription>Cinna the Poet has the misfortune of having the same name as one of Caesar&#8217;s murderers, and of not being known for good writing. He is torn to pieces by a mob.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">

</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="MET.">Metellus Cimber</persname>
<persdescription>Metellus Cimber is one of the conspirators against Caesar. He suggests Ligarius as another possible member of their cause.

</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="DEC.">Decius Brutus</persname>
<persdescription>Decius Brutus is one of the conspirators against Caesar. He attends the meeting at Brutus&#8217;s house when they bind each other to the murder, and queries whether only Caesar should die. He goes to Caesar&#8217;s house to urge him to go to the Capitol, reinterpreting Calpurnia&#8217;s foreboding dream, claiming that the Senate intends to give Caesar a crown, and playing on his vanity. He is one of those who kneels to surround Caesar and prevent him from fleeing.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="LIG.">Caius Ligarius</persname>
<persdescription>Caius Ligarius is one of the conspirators against Caesar. He spoke well of Pompey and was mistreated by Caesar for doing so, which he bears against the dictator. Learning that Brutus is involved in the conspiracy, he visits him to be certain of his purpose, and on being reassured joins in with the others whole-heartedly.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="TREB.">Trebonius</persname>
<persdescription>Trebonius is one of the conspirators against Caesar. He attends the meeting at Brutus&#8217;s house when they bind themselves to the murder. He is charged with getting Antony out of the way prior to the deed, and witnesses his flight from the Capitol. He also presses a suit on Caesar that distracts the dictator from reading Artemidorus&#8217;s petition.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="CASCA.">Casca</persname>
<persdescription>Casca is a cynical Roman with no great taste for Caesar&#8217;s fooling over the crown. He disdains the mob and their poor oral hygiene as much as he disdains Cicero&#8217;s elitist erudition. His poise is shattered by the storm and eerie events of the night, and in that state is convinced by Cassius of the need for Caesar&#8217;s death. He agrees with the need to have Brutus on board for the sake of convincing the people of the justness of their cause. He at first wants Cicero to be asked to join as well, but Brutus quickly convinces him otherwise. He is the first to strike Caesar at the Capitol.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="CAS.">Cassius</persname>
<persdescription>Cassius is a noble Roman, and the mastermind behind Caesar&#8217;s assassination. He observes people and takes little enjoyment from life other than what allows for a sardonic smile. He is pettily jealous of Caesar for being, as he sees it, a weaker human being than he is himself, and despises those who make him out to be almost a god. He plays on Brutus&#8217;s honor and descent from the Brutus who freed Rome from monarchy to have him join him in murdering Caesar. Once he has succeeded in doing so, however, he quickly loses his place at the head of the conspiracy to Brutus. He agrees to Brutus&#8217;s willingness to let Antony live, and his later letting Antony speak to the crowd, but with deep misgivings. He and Brutus fall out further during the war over a series of miscommunications over financing, but they reconcile themselves. He considers himself a better soldier than Brutus, and his instinct not to bring the fight to the enemy is the right one, but again he allows Brutus&#8217;s arguments to sway him. He grows superstitious at the war goes on, despite his previous scoffing at omens. Convinced that all is lost when his army is beaten by Antony&#8217;s, and that Brutus has also been defeated, he has his bondman kill him, thus dying as he had promised to rather than be captured.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="BRU.">Marcus Brutus</persname>
<persdescription>Brutus is a noble Roman, descended from the Brutus who liberated Rome from the tyrannical monarchy of the Tarquins. He is greatly honored for his lineage and personal nobility by the people of Rome, and Caesar is particularly shocked to find him among those stabbing him to death. A logician, he is able to talk himself into anything, including the murder of Caesar, while never noticing how his logic forever betrays him. He desperately attempts to keep the conspiracy honorable, neither requiring an oath nor murdering anyone other than Caesar. Believing that everyone will be swayed by good logical argument, he thinks that the people of Rome will approve of the nobility of their act. He offers the mob of plebeians a prose logic-chopping to explain his acts, and at first carries the day, but Antony&#8217;s open emotionalism quickly overturns this. He falls out with Cassius during the war over misunderstandings about money, but is reconciled to him. He still offers strong logical reasons for bad decisions that will in the end cost them the war. He loves and admires his wife, a being at least as stoical and honorable as he. He plays the part of the stoical Roman well: when Messala brings him news of Portia&#8217;s death, he does not let on that he is already aware of it, leaving the messenger to wonder at the strength of his response. He disapproves of his father-in-law Cato&#8217;s suicide, but resolves to do the same if need be to avoid being captured. He is fond of his servants and treats them well, and enjoys music. At first frightened by Caesar&#8217;s ghost, he takes heart again, but its second appearance to him, at the battle of Philippi, convinces him that his life is at an end. Needing assistance to end his own life, he has a very difficult time finding anyone willing to help him. None of his old friends will, only a soldier he barely knows. In death, he is admired as being the only one of the conspirators to have joined in the deed for an idealistic reason.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="POP.">Popilius Lena</persname>
<persdescription>Popillius is a Senator of Rome. He knows that Cassius has something in mind at the Capitol, and wishes him luck, bringing about a moment of fear for the conspirators.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="PUB.">Publius</persname>
<persdescription>Publius is a Senator of Rome. An old man, he pushes Artemidorus aside when the latter tries to give his letter to Caesar. Present at the murder, he does not flee with the rest of the crowd, but remains in place in shock. He is sent out by the killers to tell the world that nobody else is threatened with harm.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="CIC.">Cicero</persname>
<persdescription>Cicero is a Senator of Rome. An older, gray-haired man, he is rather an elitist, he is highly intelligent, given to speaking Greek so that only the educated can understand him, dislikes being crossed by anyone, and will not join anything he has not himself begun, this last being the only reason he is not asked to join the conspiracy against Caesar. He possesses a strong reputation for wisdom among the population. He is put to death during the purges carried out by Octavius and Antony after Caesar&#8217;s death.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="LEP.">M. Aemilius Lepidus</persname>
<persdescription>Lepidus is a Senator of Rome. He is present at Caesar&#8217;s death, and flees from it. An excellent soldier if not the most intelligent of men, he becomes the third ruler of Rome along with Octavius and Antony after Caesar&#8217;s death. He acquiesces in his brother&#8217;s execution during the triumvirate&#8217;s takeover. His further adventures can be found in <persnameref>Antony and  Cleopatra</persnameref>.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="ANT.">Mark Antony</persname>
<persdescription>Mark Antony is Caesar&#8217;s closest companion. A young man much given to reveling, enjoying music and plays, he runs in the sacred race of the Feast of Lupercal, touching Calpurnia on the way in the hopes of curing her barrenness. A great upholder of obedience to Caesar, he is not as good a judge of men as his mentor, discounting Caesar&#8217;s opinion of Cassius. Brutus underestimates him severely, considering little more than an extension of Caesar. Antony manages to con the conspirators, particularly Brutus, into letting him speak to the crowd after the murder. He accepts to say nothing negative about the conspirators in his funeral oration, and circumvents this by his constant references to them as &#8216;honorable men&#8217;. In contrast to Brutus&#8217;s prose logic-chopping, he gives a shrewdly emotional speech to the crowd, showing them Caesar&#8217;s body and reading them his will, whipping them to a fury. He is ruthless enough to add his own nephew to the list of Romans to be purged once he, Octavius and Lepidus join forces to resist the conspirators. He has little use for Lepidus and does not appreciate Octavius&#8217;s lack of respect for his greater age and experience. Once Brutus is dead, he is willing to praise him for his idealism. His further adventures can be found in <persnameref>Antony and Cleopatra</persnameref>.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="OCT.">Octavius Caesar</persname>
<persdescription>Octavius is Caesar&#8217;s nephew. Called to Rome by his uncle, he is greeted on its outskirts by the news of Caesar&#8217;s death. Despite Antony&#8217;s warnings, he enters Rome before it is safe, and goes to Caesar&#8217;s house, where he meets Lepidus and Antony. He is not easily impressed, and refuses to let Antony take the main leadership role in the war against the conspirators, simply announcing what he intends to do and letting the other deal with the fact. This does not necessarily serve him well: he is not as great a general as Antony, and his force is defeated by Brutus&#8217;s at the battle of Philippi. He is defiant towards the conspirators, though willing to honor them once they are dead. He is proud of his family name. His further adventures can be found in <persnameref>Antony and Cleopatra</persnameref>.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="CAES.">Julius Caesar</persname>
<persdescription>Julius Caesar is a great general of Rome, who has recently won a civil war against Pompey and returns to Rome in triumph. He is beloved by many, almost to idolatry, and hated by some. He is somewhat old, not as physically powerful as he believes, deaf in the left ear, and subject to epileptic fits. He is also pompous and given to speaking of himself in the third person. He is hopeful that his wife&#8217;s barrenness may be cured during the Feast of Lupercal. A good leader of men, he has good instincts about them that he does not always listen to. He refuses to be crowned king when the crowd approves his refusal, despite an evident desire to accept the crown. He is swayed by his wife&#8217;s fears for a time, but the thought of receiving a crown, and appeals to his vanity &#8212; such as the thought that he might be considered a coward &#8212; convince him to go to the Capitol in spite of Calpurnia&#8217;s premonitions. He plays the role of Caesar to the hilt, insisting on his constancy, equanimity, and refusal to budge. He does not notice how he is surrounded when the conspirators kneel to prevent him from fleeing, and is shocked that Brutus is among the men stabbing him. He returns as a Ghost to warn Brutus that they will meet again at Philippi. Brutus takes his second appearance as a sign that his time is come.</persdescription>

<persdescription>Octavius&#8217;s Attendant is sent by his master to give Antony a message, and arrives at the Capitol to find him with Caesar&#8217;s body. He helps Antony carry Caesar&#8217;s body to the Forum, where he witnesses Antony&#8217;s speech before returning to Octavius to tell him which way the wind is blowing. He returns to Antony to tell him where to find Octavius, and of the conspirators&#8217; flight.</persdescription>

<persdescription>A Cobbler leaves his shop to go see Caesar&#8217;s triumph, and takes the whole day off. He encourages others to do the same.

<persaliases>
	<persname short="ALL PLEBEIANS.">All Plebeians</persname>
</persaliases>
<persdescription>The First Plebeian chooses to listen to Brutus when the latter comes forward to explain his murdering Caesar. He is easily convinced that Caesar was a tyrant, but Antony&#8217;s speech causes him some doubts. He is soon converted to Antony&#8217;s cause by the sight of Caesar&#8217;s body, and is the first to suggest arson, calling on his fellows to burn the conspirators&#8217; houses with torches lit at Caesar&#8217;s pyre once they have honorably immolated the corpse. He knows that Cinna is the name of one of the conspirators, and helps to tear to pieces the first man of that name he and his companions come across.</persdescription>

</persaliases>
<persdescription>The Third Plebeian knows Brutus to be noble, and soon wishes to have him in charge of Rome. By calling for Brutus to be the new Caesar, he both offers evidence that the conspirators&#8217; fears of Caesar&#8217;s dictatorship were founded and that he has completely mistaken Brutus&#8217;s point. Knowing Antony to be noble, he is convinced by his speech as well. Joining the revengeful mob, he helps tear Cinna the poet to pieces before telling the others exactly which houses to burn down.</persdescription>

</persaliases>
<persdescription>The Fourth Plebeian is at first convinced by Brutus&#8217;s explanation for the murder of Caesar, calling for a statue to be raised to the murderer, but he is willing to listen to Antony. The latter&#8217;s speech causes him some doubts, and he is soon fully convinced that the conspirators were unworthy murderers. He is emotional, moved by the sight of Antony&#8217;s tears and pledging to die for him. He joins the rampaging mob. He is not a fan of poetry.</persdescription>

<persdescription>The Fifth Plebeian is convinced by Brutus&#8217;s speech explaining the murder of Caesar and believes that the murderer will have all of Caesar&#8217;s qualities and none of his vices. He is then quickly convinced by Antony&#8217;s speech that this opinion is wrong. He remembers that Caesar refused to take a crown the day before, and is insistent on hearing the will. He helps to foment the mob&#8217;s rampage.</persdescription>

<scenepersonae>(Flavius, Murellus, Commoners)</scenepersonae>
<scenedescription>Rome is filled with celebrating commoners taking a day off work to go see Caesar&#8217;s triumphant return from the civil wars. The tribunes Flavius and Murellus reproach them and order them to get back to work, accusing them of hypocrisy for celebrating the man who destroyed Pompey, their former idol. Flavius suggests that they go about tearing down the decorations set up for Caesar&#8217;s return. Murellus, more cautious, is uncertain whether they have the right too, as it is a religious feast day, but Flavius insists that the odds of Caesar growing too proud is great enough to take the risk.</scenedescription>

<scenelocation>Rome. A public place.</scenelocation>
<scenepersonae>(Caesar, Antony, Calphurnia, Portia, Decius, Cicero, Brutus, Cassius, Casca, Citizens, Soothsayer, Murellus, Flavius)</scenepersonae>
<scenedescription>Caesar and his suite enter. Antony is dressed running the Lupercal race. Caesar reminds him to touch Calphurnia as he runs, as this may cure her barrenness. A soothsayer cries out and warns Caesar to beware the Idea of March, but the great man pays him no heed. Cassius talks to Brutus when the latter chooses not to view the races. He has noticed that Brutus is not happy of late. Cassius reminds him that his ancestor freed Rome from the tyranny of the monarchy. Brutus, who loves Caesar, nevertheless fears that the mob might acclaim him king, which he could not stand; Cassius, on the other hand, is sharply envious of Caesar&#8217;s elevation, pointing out that he is only a man, in many ways a weak man, but is being turned into a god by the people. Caesar leaves the forum and admits to Antony that he is weary of Cassius. Casca tells Cassius and Brutus how Caesar was offered a crown but, to the people&#8217;s delight, rejected it, though it seemed clear he hoped they would encourage him to take it, and fell down in a fit. They arrange to meet again the next day; Casca mentions that Flavius and Murellus have been arrested. Cassius sees that he will have to do more to make Brutus take action, and plans to send him letters written in various hands urging him to take down Caesar.</scenedescription>

<line form="verse">And stemming it with hearts of controversy;</line>
<line form="verse">But ere we could arrive the point propos&#8217;d,</line>

<line form="verse">Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder</line>

<line form="verse">Mark him, and write his speeches in their books,</line>
<line form="verse">Alas, it cried, &#8220;Give me some drink, Titinius,&#8221;</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CASCA.</speaker>
<line form="prose">I can as well be hang&#8217;d as tell the manner of it: it was mere foolery, I did not mark it. I saw Mark Antony offer him a crown&#8212;yet &#8217;twas not a crown neither, &#8217;twas one of these coronets&#8212;and as I told you, he put it by once; but for all that, to my thinking, he would fain have had it. Then he offer&#8217;d it to him again; then he put it by again; but, to my thinking, he was very loath to lay his fingers off it. And then he offer&#8217;d it the third time; he put it the third time by; and still as he refus&#8217;d it, the rabblement howted, and clapp&#8217;d their chopp&#8217;d hands, and threw up their sweaty night-caps, and utter&#8217;d such a deal of stinking breath because Caesar refus&#8217;d the crown, that it had, almost, chok&#8217;d Caesar, for he swounded, and fell down at it; and for mine own part, I durst not laugh, for fear of opening my lips and receiving the bad air.</line>
</speech>

<line form="prose">But soft I pray you; what, did Caesar swound?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CASCA.</speaker>

<line form="verse">And honest Casca, we have the falling sickness.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CASCA.</speaker>
<line form="prose">I know not what you mean by that, but I am sure Caesar fell down. If the tag-rag people did not clap him and hiss him, according as he pleas&#8217;d and displeas&#8217;d them, as they use to do the players in the theatre, I am no true man.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BRU.</speaker>
<line form="verse">What said he when he came unto himself?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CASCA.</speaker>
<line form="prose">Marry, before he fell down, when he perceiv&#8217;d the common herd was glad he refus&#8217;d the crown, he pluck&#8217;d me ope his doublet, and offer&#8217;d them his throat to cut. And I had been a man of any occupation, if I would not have taken him at a word, I would I might go to hell among the rogues. And so he fell. When he came to himself again, he said, if he had done or said any thing amiss, he desir&#8217;d their worships to think it was his infirmity. Three or four wenches, where I stood, cried, &#8220;Alas, good soul!&#8221; and forgave him with all their hearts. But there&#8217;s no heed to be taken of them; if Caesar had stabb&#8217;d their mothers, they would have done no less.</line>

But those that understood him smil&#8217;d at one another, and shook their heads; but, for mine own part, it was Greek to me. I could tell you more news too. Murellus and Flavius, for pulling scarfs off Caesar&#8217;s images, are put to silence. Fare you well. There was more foolery yet, if I could remember it.</line>

<scenepersonae>(Brutus, Lucius, Cassius, Casca, Decius, Cinna, Metellus, Trebonius, Portia, Caius Ligarius)</scenepersonae>
<scenedescription>Sleepless, Brutus considers that he has no good reason to be rid of Caesar other than the likelihood that he will do something tyrannous, though he never has as yet, and that the only way to be rid of him is to kill him. His servant Lucius brings him yet another anonymous letter found in an odd place, again inciting Brutus to rise up against Caesar. He resolves that he will. The other conspirators arrive, and agree that they are all there for the same purpose. Many of them want to add Cicero to their number, but Brutus refuses, arguing that he will insist on leading. Brutus also insists that they kill only Caesar, so that they will not appear to be carrying out a bloodthirsty coup, but rather a necessary surgery. Cassius in the end agrees, but still thinks Antony should be killed as well. Decius Brutus promises to make sure that Caesar goes to the Capitol that day. The conspirators leave, waiting to meet again at the time of the assassination. Brutus&#8217;s wife Portia, who has been worried by her husband&#8217;s concerned looks and insomnia, asks him what the matter is; he promises to tell her later. Caius Ligarius, with a handkerchief hiding his face, comes to assure Brutus that he will join the conspiracy.</scenedescription>

<line form="verse">It must be by his death; and for my part,</line>

<line form="verse">How that might change his nature, there&#8217;s the question.</line>
<line form="verse">It is the bright day that brings forth the adder,</line>

<line form="verse">Th&#8217; abuse of greatness is when it disjoins</line>
<line form="verse">Remorse from power; and to speak truth of Caesar,</line>
<line form="verse">I have not known when his affections sway&#8217;d</line>
<line form="verse">More than his reason. But &#8217;tis a common proof</line>
<line form="verse">That lowliness is young ambition&#8217;s ladder,</line>
<line form="verse">Whereto the climber-upward turns his face;</line>
<line form="verse">But when he once attains the upmost round,</line>
<line form="verse">He then unto the ladder turns his back,</line>
<line form="verse">Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees</line>
<line form="verse">By which he did ascend. So Caesar may;</line>
<line form="verse">Then lest he may, prevent. And since the quarrel</line>
<line form="verse">Will bear no color for the thing he is,</line>
<line form="verse">Fashion it thus: that what he is, augmented,</line>
<line form="verse">Would run to these and these extremities;</line>
<line form="verse">And therefore think him as a serpent&#8217;s egg,</line>

<scenedescription>Caesar&#8217;s sleep has been disturbed by the storm and his wife Calphurnia&#8217;s bad dreams. He calls for the priests to make sacrifices to see what sort of a day it will be. Calphurnia begs him not to go to the Capitol, terrified by the omen-ridden dreams she has had. The priests report back that they are unable to read anything in the entrails today, and recommend that he stay home. He agrees to do so. Decius Brutus arrives and convinces him to go, first reinterpreting Calphurnia&#8217;s dream to give it a happy meaning, and secondly implying that Caesar will be a coward to stay. </scenedescription>

<scenedescription>Caesar points out to the Soothsayer that it is the Ides of March, but the Soothsayer remind him that they are not yet over. Artemidorus attempts to give his letter to Caesar, but the latter insists that since it concerns him, he will deal with it last. The conspirators slowly surround Caesar, and at an opportune moment stab him to death. The bystanders flee in terror. Caesar&#8217;s last thought is horror at the realization that Brutus is one of the conspirators. The conspirators bathe their hands in Caesar&#8217;s blood, hoping to make it a holy act. A messenger from Antony asks to be allowed to approach in safety, promising to pledge allegiance to Brutus if he can give a good reason for Caesar&#8217;s death. Cassius is uncertain, but Brutus is sure he will be able to win Antony over. Antony enters and shakes hands with the conspirators, agreeing to wait until they have calmed the commoners down before anything else happens. Antony cannot keep himself from praising Caesar a bit too much for present company. He asks permission to deliver Caesar&#8217;s funeral oration; Brutus agrees, since he plans to explain the murder first and thus imagines that all will be safe. Cassius grows ever more worried. Left alone with the corpse, Antoyn speaks to Caesar, begging his pardon for being so gentle but promising revenge. He sends a message to Caesar&#8217;s nephew Octavius, who is outside Rome, warning him not to enter yet, as it is not safe. He carries Caesar&#8217;s corpse to the Forum.</scenedescription>

<scenedescription>In precise, legalistic prose, Brutus explains to the mob why he killed Caesar, explaining that he did it for the sake of freedom and equality, and that he loves Rome more than he did Caesar. The mob approves. Then Antony comes to give Caesar&#8217;s funeral speech, a perfectly-tuned, fiery, rabble-rousing piece that undoes all that Brutus has accomplished and whips the mob into a rage, sending them rioting to kill all the conspirators they can find. By this point Brutus and Cassius have fled from Rome; Antony goes to meet Octavius and Lepidus.</scenedescription>

If there be any in this assembly, any dear friend of Caesar&#8217;s, to him I say, that Brutus&#8217; love to Caesar was no less than his. If then that friend demand why Brutus rose against Caesar, this is my answer: Not that I lov&#8217;d Caesar less, but that I lov&#8217;d Rome more. Had you rather Caesar were living, and die all slaves, than that Caesar were dead, to live all freemen? As Caesar lov&#8217;d me, I weep for him; as he was fortunate, I rejoice at it; as he was valiant, I honor him; but, as he was ambitious, I slew him. There is tears for his love; joy for his fortune; honor for his valor; and death for his ambition. Who is here so base that would be a bondman? If any, speak, for him have I offended. Who is here so rude that would not be a Roman? If any, speak, for him have I offended. Who is here so vile that will not love his country? If any, speak, for him have I offended.

<scenedescription>Cassius reproves Brutus for paying no attention to his letters begging for mercy on a friend; Brutus accuses him of taking bribes. Brutus cannot abide this, as it ruins the image of the conspirators as noble, ethical men, which he thinks their strongest point. The two quarrel bitterly, Cassius pointing out that he is the more experienced soldier. In the end they are reconciled. Brutus tells Cassius that Portia has committed suicide, and that his grief is only one of the cares pressing on him and making him short-tempered. They hear that the triumvirate has put to death possibly as many as a hundred senators. Other news informs them that the enemy is gathering at Philippi; Cassius would rather not fight there, but Brutus insists. Brutus has Lucius play him some music, but the servant is exhausted and falls asleep. The Ghost of Caesar appears, naming itself as Brutus&#8217;s evil spirit, and tells him that they will meet again at Philippi. Brutus seeks to see whether anybody else saw the ghost, but no-one has.</scenedescription>

<scenepersonae>(Octavius, Antony, Messenger, Brutus, Cassius, Lucilius, Titinius, Messala)</scenepersonae>
<scenedescription>Octavius and Antony are not the best of partners for a battle, having deeply divergent opinions on matters. Octavius simply refuses to do as Antony asks, and calmly takes the part of the battle that he chooses. Cassius, Brutus and their armies enter, and the leaders taunt each other. The cynical Cassius is starting to believe in ill omens, and is worried about the outcome of the battle. Brutus and Cassius say farewell to each other, well aware that if they lose they will never see one another again. They discuss whether, if beaten, they will kill themselves.</scenedescription>
