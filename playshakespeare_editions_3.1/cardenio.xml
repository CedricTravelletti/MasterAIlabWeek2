<STAGEDIR>Enter the new Usurping Tyrant, the nobles of his faction, Memphonius, Sophonirus, Helvetius, with others; the right heir Govianus, deposed. A sennet.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TYR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thus high, my lords, your powers and constant loves</LINE>
<LINE>Hath fixed our glories like unmov&#8217;d stars</LINE>
<LINE>That know not what it is to fall or err.</LINE>
<LINE>We&#8217;re the kingdom&#8217;s love, and he that was</LINE>
<LINE>Flattered awhile, so stands before us now</LINE>
<LINE>Readier for doom than dignity.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GOV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">So much</LINE>
<LINE>Can the adulterate friendship of mankind,</LINE>
<LINE>False Fortune&#8217;s sister, bring to pass on kings, And lay usurpers sunning in their glories Like adders in warm beams.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TYR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">There was but one</LINE>
<LINE>In whom my heart took pleasure (amongst women), One in the whole creation, and in her You dared to be my rival! Was&#8217;t not bold? Now we are king, she'll leave the lower path And find the way to us. Helvetius! It is thy daughter. Happier than a king And far above him, for she kneels to thee Whom we have kneeled to, richer in one smile That came from her than she in all thy blessings! If thou be&#8217;st proud, thou art to be forgiven;</LINE>
<LINE>It is no deadly sin in thee. While she lives,</LINE>
<LINE>High lust is not more natural to youth</LINE>
<LINE>Than that to thee. Be not afraid to die in&#8216;t;</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis but the sign of joy. There is no gladness</LINE>
<LINE>But has a pride it lives by. That&#8217;s the oil</LINE>
<LINE>That feeds it into flames. Let her be sent for</LINE>
<LINE>And honorably attended, as beseems</LINE>
<LINE>Her that we make our queen. My lords Memphonius</LINE>
<LINE>And Sophonirus, take into your care</LINE>
<LINE>The royal business of my heart. Conduct her</LINE>
<LINE>With a respect equal with that to us.</LINE>
<LINE>If more, it shall be pardoned; so still err,</LINE>
<LINE>You honour us, but ourself honours her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MEMP.</SPEAKER>
<STAGEDIR>Aside.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Strange fortune! Does he make his queen of her?</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit Memphonius.</STAGEDIR>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SOPH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have a wife; would she were so preferred! I could be but her subject; so I&#8217;m now:</LINE>
<LINE>I allow her her one friend to stop her mouth</LINE>
<LINE>And keep her quiet, gi' him his table free,</LINE>
<LINE>And the huge feeding of his great stone horse</LINE>
<LINE>On which he rides in pomp about the city</LINE>
<LINE>Only to speak to gallants in bay-windows.</LINE>
<LINE>Marry, his lodging he pays dearly for;</LINE>
<LINE>He gets me all my children; there I save by&#8216;t.</LINE>
<LINE>Besides I draw my life out by the bargain</LINE>
<LINE>Some twelve years longer than the times appointed;</LINE>
<LINE>When my young prodigal gallant kicks up&#8217;s heels</LINE>
<LINE>At one-and-thirty, and lies dead and rotten</LINE>
<LINE>Some five-and-forty years before I&#8217;m coffined.</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis the right way to keep a woman honest:</LINE>
<LINE>One friend is barricado to a hundred</LINE>
<LINE>And keeps &#8216;em out. Nay more, a husband&#8217;s sure</LINE>
<LINE>To have his children all of one man&#8217;s getting,</LINE>
<LINE>And he that performs best can have no better.</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;m e&#8217;en as happy then that save a labour.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit Sophonirus.</STAGEDIR>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TYR.</SPEAKER>
<STAGEDIR>To Helvetius.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Thy honours with thy daughter&#8217;s love shall rise. I shall read thy deservings in her eyes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O may they be eternal books of pleasure</LINE>
<LINE>To show you all delight!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GOV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The loss of her sits closer to my heart Than that of kingdom or the whorish pomp Of this world&#8217;s titles, that with flattery swells us And makes us die like beasts fat for destruction.</LINE>
<LINE>But when she turns her head by chance and sees The fortunes that are my companions,</LINE>
<LINE>She'll snatch her eyes off and repent the looking.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TYR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis well advised: we doom thee, Govianus, To banishment forever from our kingdom.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GOV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What could be worse to one whose heart is locked Up in another&#8217;s bosom! Banishment!</LINE>
<LINE>And why not death? Is that too easy for me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TYR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But that the world would call our way to dignity</LINE>
<LINE>A path of blood, it should be the first act in all our reign.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GOV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She&#8217;s lost forever!</LINE>
<LINE>To Nobles Farewell, virtuous men, Too honest for your greatness. Now y&#8217;are mightier Than when we knew the kingdom; your style&#8217;s heavier.</LINE>
<LINE>Then, ponderous nobility, farewell!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. NOBLE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">How&#8217;s that, sir?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GOV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Weighty and serious!â€”O, sir, is it you?</LINE>
<LINE>When your discretion sucked; is&#8216;t come from nurse yet?</LINE>
<LINE>You seem to be a scholar; you were born better.</LINE>
<LINE>You have good lands; that&#8217;s the best grounds of learning.</LINE>
<LINE>If you can conster but your doctor&#8217;s bill,</LINE>
<LINE>Pierce your wife&#8217;s waiting-women, and decline your tenants</LINE>
<LINE>Till they're all beggars with new fines and rackings,</LINE>
<LINE>Y'are scholar good enough for a lady&#8217;s son</LINE>
<LINE>That&#8217;s born to living. If you list to read,</LINE>
<LINE>Ride but to th' city and bestow your looks</LINE>
<LINE>On the court library, the mercers&#8217; books;</LINE>
<LINE>They&#8217;ll quickly furnish you: do but entertain</LINE>
<LINE>A tailor for your tutor to expound</LINE>
<LINE>All the hard stuff to you, by what name and title</LINE>
<LINE>Soever they be called.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. NOBLE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">I thank you, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GOV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis happy you have learnt so much manners, Since you have so little wit. Fare you well, sir!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TYR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let him be stayed awhile.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. NOBLE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="9">Stay!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. NOBLE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">You must stay, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GOV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He&#8217;s not so honest, sure, to change his mind, Revoke his doom. Hell has more hope on him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TYR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We have not ended yet; the worst part&#8217;s coming: Thy banishment were gentle were that all. But t'afflict thy soul, before thou goest Thou shalt behold the heaven that thou must lose In her that must be mine. Then to be banished, then to be deprived, Shows the full torment we provide for thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GOV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here&#8217;s a right tyrant now; he will not bate me Th'affliction of my soul; he'll have all parts Suffer together.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter the Nobles with the Lady clad in black.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Now I see my loss; I never shall recover&#8216;t; my mind&#8217;s beggared.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TYR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Black! Whence risse that cloud? Can such a</LINE>
<LINE>thing be seen</LINE>
<LINE>In honour&#8217;s glorious day, the sky so clear?</LINE>
<LINE>Why mourns the kingdom&#8217;s mistress? Does she come</LINE>
<LINE>To meet advancement in a funeral garment?</LINE>
<LINE>Back! She forgot herself. 'Twas too much joy</LINE>
<LINE>That bred this error, and we heartily pardon&#8217;t.</LINE>
<LINE>To the attending Nobles Go, bring me her hither like an illustrious bride With her best beams about her. Let her jewels Be worth ten cities; that beseems our mistress, And not a widow&#8217;s case, a suit to weep in.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am not to be altered.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TYR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">How!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">I have a mind</LINE>
<LINE>That must be shifted ere I cast off these, Or else I shall wear strange colours. 'Tis not titles, Nor all the bastard honours of this frame That I am taken with. I come not hither</LINE>
<LINE>To please the eye of glory, but of goodness;</LINE>
<LINE>And that concerns not you, sir; you're for greatness I dare not deal with you: I have found my match, And I will never lose him.</LINE>
<LINE>Looks at Govianus</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GOV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If there be man Above a king in fortunes, read my story</LINE>
<LINE>And you shall find him there. Farewell, poor kingdom!</LINE>
<LINE>To the Tyrant Take it to help thee; thou hast need on&#8217;t now. I see thee in distress, more miserable Than some thou lay&#8217;st taxations on, poor subjects! Th'art all beset with storms, more overcast</LINE>
<LINE>Than ever any man that brightness flattered.</LINE>
<LINE>Tis only wretchedness to be there with thee, And happiness to be here.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TYR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Sure some dream crowned me.</LINE>
<LINE>If it were possible to be less than nothing, I wake the man you seek for. There&#8217;s the kingdom Within yon valley fixed, while I stand here</LINE>
<LINE>Kissing false hopes upon a frozen mountain, Without the confines. I am he that&#8217;s banished. The king walks yonder, chose by her affection, Which is the surer side, for where she goes</LINE>
<LINE>Her eye removes the court. What is he here</LINE>
<LINE>Can spare a look? They're all employed on her. Helvetius! Thou art not worth the waking neither; I lose but time in thee. Go sleep again: Like an old man, thou can&#8217;st do nothing;</LINE>
<LINE>Thou tak&#8217;st no pains at all to earn thine honours</LINE>
<LINE>Which way shall we be able to pay thee</LINE>
<LINE>To thy content, when we receive not ours?</LINE>
<LINE>The master of the work must needs decay</LINE>
<LINE>When he wants means, and sees his servant play.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">To the Lady</LINE>
<LINE>Have I bestowed so many blessings on thee,</LINE>
<LINE>And do they all return to me in curses? Is that the use I ha&#8217; for &#8216;em? Be not to me A burden ten times heavier than my years! Thou'd&#8217;st wont to be kind to me and observe</LINE>
<LINE>What I thought pleasing. Go, entreat the king!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will do more for you, sir; y&#8217;are my father; I&#8217;ll kiss him, too.</LINE>
<LINE>She kisses Govianus</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">How am I dealt withal?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why that&#8217;s the usurper, sir; this is the king. I happened lighter than you thought I had.</LINE>
<LINE>And were all kingdoms of the earth his own,</LINE>
<LINE>As sure as this is not, and this dear gentleman</LINE>
<LINE>As poor as virtue and almost as friendless,</LINE>
<LINE>I would not change this misery for that sceptre</LINE>
<LINE>Wherein I had part with him. Sir, be cheerfiil.</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis not the reeling fortune of great state</LINE>
<LINE>Or low condition that I cast mine eye at. It is the man I seek; the rest I lose As things unworthy to be kept or noted. Fortunes are but the outsides of true worth.</LINE>
<LINE>It is the mind that sets his master forth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TYR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Has there so many bodies been hewn down Like trees in progress, to cut out a way That was ne&#8217;er known, for us and our affections, And is our game so crossed? There stands the first Of all her kind that ever refused greatnessâ€”</LINE>
<LINE>A woman to set light by sovereignty! What age can bring her forth, and hide that book? 'Tis their desire most commonly to rule More than their part comes toâ€”sometimes their husbands.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis in your power, my lord, to force her to you</LINE>
<LINE>And pluck her from his arms.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TYR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Thou talk&#8217;st unkindly.</LINE>
<LINE>That had been done before thy thought begot it If my affection could be so hard-hearted To stand upon such payment. It must come</LINE>
<LINE>Gently and kindly, like a debt of love,</LINE>
<LINE>Or &#8216;tis not worth receiving.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GOV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Now usurper,</LINE>
<LINE>I wish not happier freedom than the banishment That thou hast laid upon me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TYR.</SPEAKER>
<STAGEDIR>Aside.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>O, he kills me</LINE>
<LINE>At mine own weapon! 'Tis I that live in exile. Should she forsake the land, I&#8217;ll feign some cause</LINE>
<LINE>Far from the grief itself to call it back.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>To Govianus.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>That doom of banishment was but lent to thee To make a trial of thy factious spirit, Which flames in thy desire. Thou wouldst be gone. There is some combination betwixt thee</LINE>
<LINE>And foreign plots; thou hast some powers to raise, Which, to prevent, thy banishment we revoke,</LINE>
<LINE>Confine thee to thy house nearest our court, And place a guard about thee. Lord Memphonius, See it effected.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MEMP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>With best care, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GOV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Confine me? Here&#8217;s my liberty in mine arms; I wish no better to bring me content. Love&#8217;s best freedom is close prisonment!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt Lady and Govianus.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TYR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Methinks the day e&#8217;en darkens at her absence.</LINE>
<LINE>I stand as in a shade, when a great cloud</LINE>
<LINE>Muffles the sun, whose beams shine afar off On tow'rs and mountains; But I keep the valleys, The place that is last served.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TYR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your reason, sir?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your grace is mild to all but your own bosom. They should have both been sent to several prisons, And not committed to each other&#8217;s arms. There&#8217;s a hot durance! He'll ne&#8217;er wish more freedom!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TYR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis true; let &#8216;em be both forced back. Stay, we command you!</LINE>
<LINE>Thou talk&#8217;st not like a statesman. Had my wrath Took hold of such extremity at first, They'd lived suspectful still, warned by their fears; Where, now that liberty makes &#8216;em more secure, I&#8217;ll take &#8216;em at my pleasure. It gives thee Freer access to play the father for us, And ply her to our will.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Mass, so it does.</LINE>
<LINE>Let a man think on&#8217;t twice, your grace hath happened Upon a strange way, yet it proves the nearest.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TYR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, more to vex his soul, give command straight</LINE>
<LINE>They be divided into several rooms,</LINE>
<LINE>Where he may only have a sight of her To his mind&#8217;s torment, but his arms and lips Locked up like felons from her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Now you win me.</LINE>
<LINE>I like that cruelty passing well, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TYR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Give order with all speed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Though I be old,</LINE>
<LINE>I need no spur, my lord; honour pricks me. I do beseech your grace look cheerfully. You shall not want content if it be locked In any blood of mine. The key&#8217;s your own. You shall command the words.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TYR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Say&#8217;st thou so, sir?</LINE>
<LINE>I were ingrateful then, should I see thee Want honour, that provides content for me.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pray, sir, confine your thoughts and excuse me.</LINE>
<LINE>Methinks the deposed king your brother&#8217;s sorrow Should find you business enough.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE offset="5">How, Votarius!</LINE>
<LINE>Sorrow for him? Weak ignorance talks not like thee. Why, he was never happier.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>H&#8217;as lost the kingdom, but his mind&#8217;s restored.</LINE>
<LINE>Which is the larger empire, prithee tell me.</LINE>
<LINE>Dominions have their limits; the whole earth Is but a prisoner, nor the sea her jailor, That with a silver hoop locks in her body.</LINE>
<LINE>They're fellow prisoners, though the sea looks bigger</LINE>
<LINE>Because he is in office and pride swells him.</LINE>
<LINE>But the unbounded kingdom of the mind</LINE>
<LINE>Is as unlimitable as heaven, that glorious court of spirits,</LINE>
<LINE>All honest courtiers!</LINE>
<LINE>Sir, if thou lov&#8217;st me, turn thine eye to me,</LINE>
<LINE>And look not after him that needs thee not.</LINE>
<LINE>My brother&#8217;s well attended; peace and pleasure</LINE>
<LINE>Are never from his sight. He has his mistress.</LINE>
<LINE>She brought those servants and bestowed them on him.</LINE>
<LINE>But who brings mine?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Had you not both long since</LINE>
<LINE>By a kind, worthy lady, your chaste wife?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That&#8217;s it that I take pains with thee to be sure of. What true report can I send to my soul Of that I know not? We must only think</LINE>
<LINE>Our ladies are good people, and so live with &#8216;em:</LINE>
<LINE>A fine security for them! Our own thoughts Make the best fools of us; next to them, our wives.</LINE>
<LINE>But say she&#8217;s all chaste, yet is that her goodness?</LINE>
<LINE>What labour is&#8216;t for a woman to keep constant</LINE>
<LINE>That&#8217;s never tried or tempted? Where&#8217;s her fight?</LINE>
<LINE>The war&#8217;s within her breast, her honest anger</LINE>
<LINE>Against the impudence of flesh and hell:</LINE>
<LINE>So let me know the lady of my rest,</LINE>
<LINE>Or I shall never sleep well. Give not me</LINE>
<LINE>The thing that is thought good, but what&#8217;s approved so:</LINE>
<LINE>So wise men choose. O, what a lazy virtue Is chastity in a woman if no sin Should lay temptation to&#8217;t! Prithee, set to her And bring my peace along with thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">You put to me</LINE>
<LINE>A business that will do my words more shame Than ever they got honour among women. Lascivious courtings among sinful mistresses Come ever seasonably, please best. But let the boldest ruffian touch the ear Of modest ladies with adulterous sounds, Their very looks confound him and force grace Into that cheek where impudence sets her seal. That work is never undertook with courage That makes his master blush. However, sir, What profit can return to you by knowing That which you do already, with more toil? That a man needs, in having a rich diamond, Put it between a hammer and an anvil, And not believing the true worth and value, Break it in pieces to find out the goodness, And in the finding lose it? Good sir, think on&#8217;t! Nor does it taste of wit to try their strengths That are created sickly, nor of manhood. we ought not to put blocks in women&#8217;s ways, For some too often fall upon plain ground. Let me dissuade you, sir!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Have I a friend?</LINE>
<LINE>And has my love so little interest in him That I must trust some stranger with my heart, And go to seek him out?</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Nay, hark you, sir!</LINE>
<LINE>I am so jealous of your weaknesses, That rather than you should lie prostituted Before a stranger&#8217;s triumph, I would venture A whole hour&#8217;s shaming for you.</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll put him off with somewhat; guile in this Falls in with honest dealing. O, who could move Adultery to yon face! So rude a sin May not come near the meekness of her eye. My client&#8217;s cause looks so dishonestly I&#8217;ll ne&#8217;er be seen to plead in&#8216;t.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>WIFE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Was my lord</LINE>
<LINE>Seen lately here?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">He&#8217;s newly walked forth, lady.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WIFE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How was he attended?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Faith, I think with none, madam.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WIFE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That sorrow for the king his brother&#8217;s fortune</LINE>
<LINE>Prevails too much with him, and leads him strangely From company and delight.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOT.</SPEAKER>
<STAGEDIR>Aside.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>How she&#8217;s beguiled in him!</LINE>
<LINE>There&#8217;s no such natural touch, search all his bosom.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Aloud.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>That grief&#8217;s too bold with him indeed, sweet madam. And draws him from the pleasure of his time,</LINE>
<LINE>But &#8216;tis a business of affection</LINE>
<LINE>That must be done. we owe a pity, madam,</LINE>
<LINE>To all men&#8217;s misery, but especially</LINE>
<LINE>To those afflictions that claim kindred of us.</LINE>
<LINE>We&#8217;re forced to feel &#8216;em: all compassion else</LINE>
<LINE>Is but a work of charity, this, of nature, And ties our pity in a bond of blood.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WIFE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yet, sir, there is a date set to all sorrows. Nothing is everlasting in this world. Your counsel will prevail: persuade him, good sir, To fall into life&#8217;s happiness again, And leave the desolate path. I want his company: He walks at midnight in thick shady [dark] woods Where scarce the moon is starlight. I have watched him In silver nights when all the earth was dressed Up like a virgin in white innocent beams; Stood in my window cold and thinly clad T'observe him through the bounty of the moon That liberally bestowed her graces on me. And when the morning dew began to fall, Then was my time to weep. H&#8217;as lost his kindness, Forgot the way of wedlock, and become A stranger to the joys and rites of love. He&#8217;s not so good as a lord ought to be. Pray tell him so from me, sir. Exit Wife</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">That will I, madam.</LINE>
<LINE>How must I dress a strange dish for his humour.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Anselmus from his hiding place.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANS.</SPEAKER>
<STAGEDIR>Aside.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Call you this courting? Life, not one word near it! There was no syllable but was twelve score off. My faith, hot temptation! Woman&#8217;s chastity</LINE>
<LINE>In such a conflict had great need of one</LINE>
<LINE>To keep the bridge. 'Twas dangerous for the time.</LINE>
<LINE>Why, what fantastic faiths are in these days</LINE>
<LINE>Made without substance! Whom should a man trust</LINE>
<LINE>In matters about love?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Anselmus comes forward.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Mass, here he comes, too!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How now, Votarius! What&#8217;s the news for us?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You set me to a task, sir, that will find Ten ages work enough, and then unfinished. Bring sin before her! Why, it stands more quaking Than if a judge should frown on&#8217;t. Three such fits Would shake it into goodness, and quite beggar</LINE>
<LINE>The under-kingdom. not the art of man, Woman or devilâ€”</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">O, peace, man! Prithee, peace!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Can make her fit for lust.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Yet again, sir?</LINE>
<LINE>Where lives that mistress of thine, Votarius,</LINE>
<LINE>That taught thee to dissemble? I&#8216;d fain learn;</LINE>
<LINE>She makes good scholars.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">How, my lord!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou art the son of falsehood. Prithee, leave me. How truly constant, charitable, and helpful Is woman unto woman in affairs</LINE>
<LINE>That touch affection and the peace of spirit;</LINE>
<LINE>But man to man, how crooked and unkind; I thank my jealousy I heard thee all, For I heard nothing; now thou'it sure I did.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now by this light, then, wipe but off this score,</LINE>
<LINE>Since y&#8217;are so bent, and if I ever run</LINE>
<LINE>In debt again to falsehood and dissemblance,</LINE>
<LINE>For want of better means, tear the remembrance of me</LINE>
<LINE>From your best thoughts.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For thy vow&#8217;s sake, I pardon thee</LINE>
<LINE>Thy oath is now sufficient watch itself</LINE>
<LINE>Over thy actions. I discharge my jealousy:</LINE>
<LINE>I ha&#8217; no more use for&#8216;t now. To give thee way</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll have an absence made purposely for thee, And presently take horse. I&#8217;ll leave behind me An opportunity that shall fear no starting. Let thy pains deserve it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am bound to&#8217;t.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For a small time, farewell then. Hark thee!</LINE>
<LINE>Anselmus whispers in his ear</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O good sir!</LINE>
<LINE>It will do wondrous well.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit Anselmus.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>What a wild seed Suspicion sows in him, and takes small ground for&#8216;t! But happy were this lord if he would leave</LINE>
<LINE>To tempt his fate and be resolved he were so!</LINE>
<LINE>He would be but too rich.</LINE>
<LINE>Man has some enemy still that keeps him back</LINE>
<LINE>In all his fortunes, and his mind is his,</LINE>
<LINE>And that&#8217;s a mighty adversary. I had rather</LINE>
<LINE>Have twenty kings my enemies than that part;</LINE>
<LINE>For let me be at war with earth and hell So that be friends with me! I ha&#8217; sworn to make A trial of her faith. I must put on A courtier&#8217;s face and do&#8216;t; mine own will shame me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Wife.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WIFE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This is most strange of all! How one distraction Seconds another!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What&#8217;s the news, sweet madam?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WIFE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>H&#8217;as took his horse, but left his leave untaken. What should I think on&#8217;t, sir? Did ever lord Depart so rudely from his lady&#8217;s presence?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Did he forget your lip?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WIFE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That nobleness remembers.</LINE>
<LINE>He forgot all</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I&#8217;m ashamed on him.</LINE>
<LINE>Let me help, madam, to repair his manners, And mend that unkind fault.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WIFE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir! Pray, forbear!</LINE>
<LINE>You forget worse than he.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOT.</SPEAKER>
<STAGEDIR>Aside.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>So virtue save me,</LINE>
<LINE>I have enough already.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WIFE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tis himself</LINE>
<LINE>Must make amends, good sir, for his own faults.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOT.</SPEAKER>
<STAGEDIR>Aside.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>I would he'd do&#8216;t then, and ne&#8217;er trouble mein&#8216;t.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Aloud.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>But, madam, you perceive he takes the course</LINE>
<LINE>To be far off from that. He&#8217;s rode from home,</LINE>
<LINE>But his unkindness stays, and keeps with you.</LINE>
<LINE>Let whose will please his wife; he rides his horse;</LINE>
<LINE>That&#8217;s all the care he takes. I pity you, madam;</LINE>
<LINE>Y'ave an unpleasing lord. Would &#8216;twere not so.</LINE>
<LINE>I should rejoice with you.</LINE>
<LINE>You're young, the very spring&#8217;s upon you now.</LINE>
<LINE>The roses on your cheeks are but new blown.</LINE>
<LINE>Take you together, y&#8217;are a pleasant garden</LINE>
<LINE>Where all the sweetness of man&#8217;s comfort breathes.</LINE>
<LINE>But what is it to be a work of beauty</LINE>
<LINE>And want the heart that should delight in you?</LINE>
<LINE>You still retain your goodness in yourself,</LINE>
<LINE>But then you lose your glory, which is all.</LINE>
<LINE>The grace of every benefit is the use,</LINE>
<LINE>And is&#8216;t not pity you should want your grace?</LINE>
<LINE>Look you like one whose lord should walk in groves</LINE>
<LINE>About the peace of midnight? Alas, madam,</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis to me wondrous how you should spare the day</LINE>
<LINE>From amorous clips, much less the general season</LINE>
<LINE>When all the world&#8217;s a gamester!</LINE>
<LINE>That face deserves a friend of heart and spirit,</LINE>
<LINE>Discourse, and motion, indeed such a one That should observe you, madam, without ceasing, And not a weary lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WIFE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Sure I was married, sir,</LINE>
<LINE>In a dear year of love, when scarcity And famine of affection vexed poor ladies, Which makes my heart so needy. It ne&#8217;er knew Plenty of comfort yet.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Why, that&#8217;s your folly,</LINE>
<LINE>To keep your mind so miserably, madam. Change into better times; I&#8217;ll lead you to &#8216;em. What bounty shall your friend expect for his?</LINE>
<LINE>O you that can be hard to your own heart,</LINE>
<LINE>But would you use your friend&#8217;s? If I thought kindly, I&#8216;d be the man myself to serve your pleasure.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WIFE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Now, sir!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, and ne&#8217;er miss you, too. I&#8216;d not come sneaking Like a retainer once a week or so To show myself before you for my livery; I&#8216;d follow business like a household servant, Carry my work before me, and dispatch Before my lord be up, and make no words on&#8217;tâ€” The sign of a good servant.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WIFE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">'Tis not friendly done, sir,</LINE>
<LINE>To take a lady at advantage thus: Set all her wrongs before her, and then tempt her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOT.</SPEAKER>
<STAGEDIR>Aside.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Heart! I grow fond myself! 'Twas well</LINE>
<LINE>she waked me</LINE>
<LINE>Before the dead sleep of adultery took me; 'Twas stealing on me. Up, you honest thoughts, And keep watch for your master! I must hence.</LINE>
<LINE>I do not like my health; &#8216;t'as a strange relish.</LINE>
<LINE>Pray heaven I plucked mine eyes back time enough! I&#8217;ll never see her more. I praised the garden But little thought a bed of snakes lay hid in&#8216;t.</LINE>
<LINE>He prepares to leave</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WIFE.</SPEAKER>
<STAGEDIR>Aside.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>I know not how I am! I&#8217;ll call my womanâ€” Stay, for I fear thou'rt too far gone already.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOT.</SPEAKER>
<STAGEDIR>Aside.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll see her but once more. Do thy worst, love!</LINE>
<LINE>Thou art too young, fond boy, to master me.</LINE>
<LINE>He returns to the Wife I come to tell you, madam, and that plainly I&#8217;ll see your face no more. Take&#8216;t how you please.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WIFE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You will not offer violence to me, sir,</LINE>
<LINE>In my lord&#8217;s absence! What does that touch you If I want comfort?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Will you take your answer?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WIFE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is not honest in you to tempt woman:</LINE>
<LINE>When her distresses takes away her strength, How is she able to withstand her enemy?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would fain leave your sight and I could possible.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WIFE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What is&#8216;t to you, good sir, if I be pleased</LINE>
<LINE>To weep myself away, and run thus violently Into the arms of death, and kiss destruction? Does this concern you now?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Ay, marry, does it!</LINE>
<LINE>What serve these arms for but to pluck you back, These lips but to prevent all other tasters,</LINE>
<LINE>And keep that cup of nectar for themselves?</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Aside.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Heart, I&#8217;m beguiled again! Forgive me, heav&#8217;n, My lips have been naught with her! Sin&#8217;s mere</LINE>
<LINE>witchcraft.</LINE>
<LINE>Break all the engines of life&#8217;s frame in pieces, I will be master once, and whip the boy</LINE>
<LINE>Home to his mother&#8217;s lap. Face, fare thee well!</LINE>

<LINE>And he shall never come so near again; I&#8217;ll have my frailty watched over. Henceforward I&#8217;ll no more trust it single. It betrays me</LINE>

<LINE>When glory is set for thee and thy seed,</LINE>
<LINE>Advancement for thy father, beside joy</LINE>
<LINE>Able to make a latter spring in me</LINE>
<LINE>In this my fourscore summer, and renew me</LINE>
<LINE>With a reversion yet of heat and youth!</LINE>
<LINE>But the dejection of thy mind and spirit</LINE>
<LINE>Makes me, thy father, guilty of a fault</LINE>
<LINE>That draws thy birth in question, and e&#8217;en wrongs</LINE>
<LINE>Thy mother in her ashes, being at peace</LINE>
<LINE>With heaven and man. Had not her life and virtues</LINE>
<LINE>Been seals unto her faith, I should think thee now</LINE>
<LINE>The work of some hired servant, some house-tailor,</LINE>
<LINE>And no one part of my endeavor in thee.</LINE>
<LINE>Had I neglected greatness, or not rather</LINE>
<LINE>Pursued almost to my eternal hazard,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou'dst ne&#8217;er been a lord&#8217;s daughter.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thy very seed will curse thee in thy age When they shall hear the story of thy weakness: How in thy youth thy fortunes tendered thee A kingdom for thy servant, which thou left&#8217;st Basely to serve thyself. What does thou in this But merely cozen thy posterity Of royalty and succession, and thyself Of dignity present?</LINE>

<SPEAKER>LADY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Sir, your king did well</LINE>
<LINE>'Mongst all his nobles to pick out yourself And send you with these words. His politic grace Knew what he did, for well he might imagine None else should have been heard:</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Had I been</LINE>
<LINE>They'd had their answer</LINE>
<LINE>Before the question had been half-way through. But, dearest sir, I owe to you a reverence, A debt which both begins and ends with life, Never till then discharged; &#8216;tis so long-lasting Yet could you be more precious than a father, Which, next a husband, is the richest treasure Mortality can show us, you should pardon me (And yet confess too that you found me kind) To hear your words, though I withstood your mind.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Say you so, daughter? Troth, I thank you kindly, I am in hope to rise well by your means, or you to rise yourself. We&#8217;re both beholding to you. Well, since I cannot win you, I commend you; I praise your constancy and pardon you. Take Govianus to you, make the most of him; Pick out your husband there, so you'll but grant me One light request that follows.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Heaven forbid else, sir!</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Give me the choosing of your friend, that&#8217;s all.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How, sir, my friend! A light request indeed! Somewhat too light, sir, either for my wearing or your own gravity, and you look on&#8217;t well!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pish! Talk like a courtier, girl, not like a fool! Thou know&#8217;st the end of greatness, and hast wit Above the flight of twenty feathered mistresses That glister in the sun of princes&#8217; favors. Thou hast discourse in thee fit for a king&#8217;s fellowship, A princely carriage and astonishing presence. What should a husband do with all this goodness? Alas, one end on&#8217;t is too much for him, Nor is it fit a subject should be master Of such a jewel. 'Tis in the king&#8217;s power To take it for the forfeit; but I come To bear thee gently to his bed of honours, All force forgotten. The king commends him to thee With more than the humility of a servant,</LINE>
<LINE>That since thou wilt not yield to be his queen, Be yet his mistress. He shall be content with that or nothing; he shall ask no more And with what easiness that is performed Most of your women know. Having a husband, That kindness costs thee nothing: y'ave that in All over and above to your first bargain, And that&#8217;s a brave advantage for a woman If she be wise, as I suspect not thee. And having youth, and beauty, and a husband, Thou&#8217;st all the wish of woman. Take thy time, then; Make thy best market.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Can you assure me, sir,</LINE>
<LINE>Whether my father spake this? Or some spirit Of evil-wishing that has for a time Hired his voice of him to beguile me that way,</LINE>
<LINE>Presuming on his power and my obedience? I&#8216;d gladly know, that I might frame my answer According to the speaker.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">How now, baggage!</LINE>
<LINE>Am I in question with thee? Does thy scorn cast So thick an ignorance before thine eyes</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Govianus, discharging a pistol</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GOV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">The more monstrous he!</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Helvetius falls.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Art down but with the bare voice of my fury? Up, ancient sinner! Thou'it but mocked with death. I missed thee purposely; thank this dear creature.</LINE>
<LINE>O, hadst thou been anything beside her father I&#8216;d made a fearful separation on thee. I would have sent thy soul to a darker prison Than any made of clay, and thy dead body</LINE>
<LINE>As a token to the lustful king thy master.</LINE>
<LINE>Art thou struck down so soon with the short sound Of this small earthen instrument, and dost thou So little fear th' eternal noise of hell?</LINE>
<LINE>What&#8217;s she? Does she not bear thy daughter&#8217;s name?</LINE>
<LINE>How stirs thy blood, sir? Is there a dead feeling</LINE>
<LINE>Of all things fatherly and honest in thee?</LINE>
<LINE>Say thou couldst be content, for greatness&#8217; sake,</LINE>
<LINE>To end the last act of thy life in panderism</LINE>
<LINE>(As you perhaps will say your betters do),</LINE>
<LINE>Must it needs follow that unmanly sin</LINE>
<LINE>Can work upon the weakness of no woman</LINE>
<LINE>But her whose name and honour natural love</LINE>
<LINE>Bids thee preserve more charily than eyesight,</LINE>
<LINE>Health, or thy senses? Can promotion&#8217;s thirst</LINE>
<LINE>Make such a father? Turn a grave old lord</LINE>
<LINE>To a white-headed squire? Make him so base</LINE>
<LINE>To buy his honours with his daughter&#8217;s soul</LINE>
<LINE>And the perpetual shaming of his blood?</LINE>
<LINE>Hast thou the leisure, thou forgetful man,</LINE>
<LINE>To think upon advancement at these years?</LINE>
<LINE>What wouldst thou do with greatness? Dost thou hope</LINE>
<LINE>To fray death with&#8216;t? Or hast thou that conceit</LINE>
<LINE>That honour will restore thy youth again?</LINE>
<LINE>Thou art but mocked, old fellow! Tis not so;</LINE>
<LINE>Thy hopes abuse thee. Follow thine own business</LINE>
<LINE>And list not to the sirens of the world.</LINE>
<LINE>Alas, thou hadst more need kneel at an altar</LINE>
<LINE>Than to a chair of state,</LINE>
<LINE>And search thy conscience for thy sins of youth;</LINE>
<LINE>That&#8217;s work enough for age; it needs no greater.</LINE>
<LINE>Thou'it called within. Thy very eyes look inward</LINE>
<LINE>To teach thy thoughts the way, and thy affections.</LINE>
<LINE>But miserable notes that conscience sings</LINE>
<LINE>That cannot truly pray, for flattering kings.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This was well searched indeed, and without</LINE>
<LINE>favoring.</LINE>
<LINE>Blessing reward thee! Such a wound as mine Did need a pitiless surgeon. Smart on, soul! Thou&#8217;lt feel the less hereafter. Sir, I thank you. I ever saw my life in a false glass</LINE>
<LINE>Until this friendly hour. With what fair faces</LINE>
<LINE>My sins would look on me! But now truth shows &#8216;em, How loathsome and how monstrous are their forms!</LINE>
<LINE>Be you my king and master still! Henceforward My knee shall know no other earthly lord,</LINE>
<LINE>Well may I spend this life to do you service,</LINE>
<LINE>That sets my soul in her eternal way.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>All&#8217;s gone; there&#8217;s nothing but the prodigal left</LINE>
<LINE>I have played away my soul at one short game</LINE>
<LINE>Where e&#8217;en the winner loses. Pursuing sin, how often did I shun thee! How swift art thou afoot, beyond man&#8217;s goodness, Which has a lazy pace! So was I catched. A curse upon the cause! Man in these days Is not content to have his lady honest And so rest pleased with her without more toil, But he must have her tried, forsooth, and tempted. And when she proves a queen then he lies quiet: Like one that has a watch of curious making, Thinking to be more cunning than the workman, Never gives over tampering with the wheels Till either spring be weakened, balance bowed, Or some wrong pin put in, and so spoils all. How could I curse myself! Most business else Delight in the dispatch, that&#8217;s the best grace to&#8217;t; Only this work of blind, repented lust Hangs shame and sadness on his master&#8217;s cheek, Yet wise men take no warning.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter Wife.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Nor can I now;</LINE>
<LINE>Her very sight strikes my repentance backward;</LINE>
<LINE>It cannot stand against her. Chamber thoughts And words that have sport in &#8216;em, they're for ladies.</LINE>

<LINE>His very name shoots like a fever through me.</LINE>
<LINE>Now hot, now cold. Which cheek shall I turn toward him,</LINE>
<LINE>For fear he should read guiltiness in my looks? I would he would keep from home like a wise man; 'Tis no place for him now. I would not see him Of any friend alive! It is not fit</LINE>
<LINE>We two should come together; we have abused</LINE>
<LINE>Each other mightily: he used me ill To employ me thus, and I ha&#8217; used him worse! I&#8217;m too mUch even with him.</LINE>

<LINE>O, there&#8217;s a kiss! Methinks my lord</LINE>
<LINE>might taste Dissimulation rank in&#8216;t, if he had wit. He takes but of the breath of his friend&#8217;s lip. A second kiss is hers, but that she keeps For her first friend. we women have no cunning.</LINE>

<LINE>Alas, sir, would you have me work by wonders,</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEAKER>ANS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I see by this thou didst not try her thoroughly.</LINE>

<LINE>To his Wife My worthy lady, freely I confess</LINE>
<LINE>To thy wronged heart. My passion had alate</LINE>

<LINE>This comes like physic when the party&#8217;s dead.</LINE>
<LINE>Flows kindness now, when &#8216;tis so ill-deserved? This is the fortune still. Well, for this trick I&#8217;ll save my husband and his friend a labour; I&#8217;ll never marry as long as I&#8217;m honest,</LINE>
<LINE>For commonly queens have the kindest husbands.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exit Leonella; manet Votarius.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do not like his company now; &#8216;tis irksome; His eye offends me. Methinks &#8216;tis not kindly we two should live together in one house. And &#8216;tis impossible to remove me hence.</LINE>
<LINE>I must not give way first. She&#8217;s my mistress,</LINE>
<LINE>And that&#8217;s a degree kinder than a wife.</LINE>
<LINE>Women are always better to their friends</LINE>
<LINE>Than to their husbands, and more true to them.</LINE>
<LINE>Then let the worst give place, whom she'as least need on</LINE>
<LINE>He that can best be spared, and that&#8217;s her husband.</LINE>
<LINE>I do not like his overboldness with her;</LINE>
<LINE>He&#8217;s too familiar with the face I love.</LINE>
<LINE>I fear the sickness of affection.</LINE>
<LINE>I feel a grudging on&#8217;t; I shall grow jealous</LINE>
<LINE>E&#8217;en of that pleasure which she has by law,</LINE>
<LINE>I shall go near with her.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter Bellarius, passing over the stage.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Life, &#8216;tis Bellarius, my rank enemy!</LINE>
<LINE>Mine eye snatched so much sight of him. What&#8217;s his business?</LINE>
<LINE>His face half-darkened, stealing through the house</LINE>
<LINE>With a whoremaster&#8217;s pace. I like it not!</LINE>
<LINE>This lady will be served like a great woman,</LINE>
<LINE>With more attendants, I perceive, than one.</LINE>
<LINE>She has her shift of friends. Mine enemy one!</LINE>
<LINE>Do we both shun each other&#8217;s company</LINE>
<LINE>In all assemblies public, at all meetings,</LINE>
<LINE>And drink to one another in one mistress? My very thought&#8217;s my poison. Tis high time To seek for help. Where is our head physician,</LINE>
<LINE>A doctor of my making and that lecher&#8217;s?</LINE>
<LINE>O, woman! When thou once leav&#8217;st to be good,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou car&#8217;st not who stands next thee. Every sin</LINE>
<LINE>Is a companion for thee, for thy once-cracked honesty</LINE>
<LINE>Is like the breaking of whole money;</LINE>

But how has rashness and my jealousy used me: Out of my vengeance to mine enemy Confessed her yielding! I have locked myself From mine own liberty with that key. Revenge Does no man good but to his greater harm. Suspect and malice, like a mingled cup, Made me soon drunk. I knew not what I spoke, And that may get me pardon.</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>O no, my lord, not he spoke no such word.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Aside.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll say as he would ha&#8216;t, for I&#8216;d be loath</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SOPH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O my lord, as plain as my wife&#8217;s tongue,</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Why, that&#8217;s my daughter!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TYR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, is it so? Have you unlocked your memory? What says she to us?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Nothing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TYR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">How thou tempt&#8217;st us!</LINE>
<LINE>What didst thou say to her, being sent from us?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>More than was honest, yet it was but little.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TYR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How cruelly thou work&#8217;st upon our patience, Having advantage 'cause thou art her father!</LINE>
<LINE>But be not bold too far: if duty leave thee,</LINE>
<LINE>Respect will fall from us.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Have I kept life</LINE>
<LINE>So long till it looks white upon my head, Been threescore years a courtier, and a flatterer not above threescore hours, which time&#8217;s repented Amongst my greatest follies, and am I at these days</LINE>
<LINE>Fit for no place but bawd to mine own flesh? You'll prefer all your old courtiers to good services. If your lust keep but hot some twenty winters, we are like to have a virtuous world of wives, Daughters and sisters, besides kinswomen</LINE>
<LINE>And cousin-Germans removed up and down, Where'er you please to have &#8216;em! Are white hairs A colour fit for pandars and flesh-brokers, Which are the honoured ornaments of age,</LINE>
<LINE>To which e&#8217;en kings owe reverence as they're men</LINE>
<LINE>And greater in their goodness than their greatness? And must I take my pay all in base money? I was a lord born, set by all court grace, And am I thrust now to a squire&#8217;s place?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TYR.</SPEAKER>
<STAGEDIR>Aside.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>How comes the moon to change so in this man,</LINE>
<LINE>That was at full but now in all performance, And swifter than my wishes? I beshrew that virtue that busied herself with him: she might have found Some other work. The man was fit for me</LINE>
<LINE>Before she spoiled him. She has wronged my heart in&#8216;t</LINE>
<LINE>And marred me a good workman. Now his art fails him,</LINE>
<LINE>What makes the man at court? This is no place</LINE>
<LINE>For fellows of no parts. He lives not here</LINE>
<LINE>That puts himself from action when we need him.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>To Helvetius.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>I take off all thy honours and bestow &#8216;em</LINE>
<LINE>On any of this rank that will deserve &#8216;em.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SOPH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, that&#8217;s I. Trouble your grace no further. I&#8217;ll undertake to bring her to your bed With some ten words. Marry, they're special charms; No lady can withstand &#8216;em. A witch taught me &#8216;em</LINE>
<LINE>If you doubt me, I&#8217;ll leave my wife in pawn For my true loyalty, and your majesty May pass away the time till I return. I have a care in all things.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TYR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">That may thrive best</LINE>
<LINE>Which the least hope looks after; but, however,</LINE>
<LINE>Force shall help nature: I&#8217;ll be too sure now.</LINE>
<LINE>Thy willingness may be fortunate; we employ thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SOPH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then I&#8217;ll go fetch my wife, and take my journey.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TYR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Stay! We require no pledge; we think thee honest.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SOPH.</SPEAKER>
<STAGEDIR>Aside.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Troth, the worse luck for me! We</LINE>
<LINE>had both been made by&#8216;t: It was the way to make my wife great, too.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TYR.</SPEAKER>
<STAGEDIR>To Helvetius.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll teach you to be wide and</LINE>
<LINE>strange to me!</LINE>
<LINE>Thou'lt feel thyself light shortly. I&#8217;ll not leave thee A title to put on but the bare name</LINE>
<LINE>That men must call thee by, and know thee miserable.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis miserable, king, to be of thy making and leave a better workman. If thy honours only keep life in baseness, take &#8216;em to thee And give &#8216;em to the hungry; there&#8217;s one gapes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SOPH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>One that will swallow you, sir, for that jest.</LINE>
<LINE>And all your titles after.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">The devil follow &#8216;em!</LINE>
<LINE>There&#8217;s room enough for him too. Leave me, thou king,</LINE>
<LINE>As poor as truth&#8212;the gentlewoman I now serve</LINE>
<LINE>And never will forsake her for her plainnessâ€”</LINE>
<LINE>That shall not alter me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>Bear that old fellow to our castle prisoner. Give charge he be kept close.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Close prisoner,</LINE>
<LINE>Why, my heart thanks thee. I shall have more time And liberty to virtue in one hour</LINE>
<LINE>Than all these threescore years I was a courtier. So by imprisonment I sustain great loss; Heaven opens to that man the world keeps close.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit Helvetius, with Guard.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SOPH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But I&#8217;ll not go to prison to try that.</LINE>
<LINE>Give me the open world; there&#8217;s a good air.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TYR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would fain send death after him, but I dare not. He knows I dare not; that would give just cause Of her unkindness everlasting to me. His life may thank his daughter. Sophonirus,</LINE>
<LINE>Here, take this jewel, bear it as a token</LINE>
<LINE>To our heart&#8217;s saint. 'Twill do thy words no harm;</LINE>
<LINE>Speech may do much, but wealth&#8217;s a greater charm</LINE>
<LINE>Than any made of words. And, to be sure,</LINE>
<LINE>If one or both should fail, I provide farther.</LINE>
<LINE>Call forth those resolute fellows whom our clemency</LINE>
<LINE>Saved from a death of shame in time of war</LINE>
<LINE>For field offences; give &#8216;em charge from us</LINE>
<LINE>They arm themselves with speed, beset the house</LINE>
<LINE>Of Govianus round, that if thou fail&#8217;st,</LINE>
<LINE>Or stay&#8217;st beyond the time thou leav&#8217;st with them,</LINE>
<LINE>They may with violence break in themselves And seize her for our use.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt Tyrant and his court. Manet Sophonirus.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SOPH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">They're not so saucy</LINE>
<LINE>To seize her for their own, I hope, As there are many knaves will begin first</LINE>
<LINE>And bring their lords the bottom. I have been served so</LINE>
<LINE>A hundred times myself by a scurvy page That I kept once but my wife loved him, And I could not help it</LINE>

<SPEAKER>LADY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Never more dearly welcome!</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Govianus runs at her, and falls by the way in a swound.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Alas, sir!</LINE>
<LINE>My lord! My love! O, thou poor-spirited man!</LINE>
<LINE>He&#8217;s gone before me. Did I trust to thee,</LINE>
<LINE>And has thou served me so? Left all the work</LINE>
<LINE>Upon my head, and stole away so smoothly?</LINE>
<LINE>There was not equal suffering shown in this;</LINE>
<LINE>And yet I cannot blame thee. Every man</LINE>
<LINE>Would seek his rest. Eternal peace sleep with thee!</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>She takes up the sword of Govianus.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Thou art my servant now. Come, thou hast lost A fearful master, but art now preferred Unto the service of a resolute lady, One that knows how to employ thee and scorns death As much as great men fear it. Where&#8217;s hell&#8217;s ministers?</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>A great knocking.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>The tyrant&#8217;s watch and guard? 'Tis of much worth When with this key the prisoner can slip forth.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>The Lady kills herself. A great knock again.</STAGEDIR>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GOV.</SPEAKER>
<STAGEDIR>Awakening.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>How now! What noise is this? I heard doors</LINE>
<LINE>beaten.</LINE>
<LINE>Where are my servants? Let men knock so loud Their master cannot sleep!</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Within.</STAGEDIR> 
<LINE>And we'll break in, my lord!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GOV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Ha! Where&#8217;s my sword?</LINE>
<LINE>I had forgot my business. O, &#8216;tis done, And never was beholding to my hand! Was I so hard to thee? So respectless of thee</LINE>
<LINE>To put all this to thee, why, it was more than I was able to perform myself with all the courage that I could take to me. It tired me. I was fain to fall and rest; And hast thou, valiant woman, overcome Thy honour&#8217;s enemies with thine own white hand, Where virgin-victory sits, all without help? Eternal praise go with thee! Spare not now; Make all the haste you can. I&#8217;ll plant this bawd Against the door, the fittest place for him, That when with ungoverned weapons they rush in, Blinded with fury, they may take his death Into the purple number of their deeds, And wipe it off from mine. He places the corpse ofSophonirus against the door. A knocking within</LINE>
<LINE>How now, forbear!</LINE>
<LINE>My lord&#8217;s at hand!</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Within.</STAGEDIR> 
<LINE>I hope the king&#8217;s officers are above &#8216;em all.</LINE>

<LINE>We have no eyes to pierce through inch boards &#8216;twas his own folly; the king must be served,</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Seeing the Lady&#8217;s body.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>My lord! What&#8217;s she?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GOV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Let me see!</LINE>
<LINE>What should she be? Now I remember her.</LINE>
<LINE>O, she was a worthy creature</LINE>
<LINE>Before destruction grew so inward with her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. FEL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, for her worthiness, that&#8217;s no work of ours. You have a lady, sir; the king commands her</LINE>
<LINE>To court with speed, and we must force her thither.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GOV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alas, she'll never strive with you; she was born e&#8217;en with the spirit of meekness. Is&#8216;t for the king?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. FEL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For his own royal and most gracious lust, or let me ne&#8217;er be trusted.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. FEL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Spoke like an honest subject, by my troth.</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8216;d do the like myself to serve my prince. Where is she, sir?</LINE>

<LINE offset="5">Look but upon yon face,</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>How came this, sir?</LINE>
<LINE>The king must know.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GOV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">From yon old fellow&#8217;s prattling.</LINE>
<LINE>All your intents he revealed largely to her,</LINE>
<LINE>And she was troubled with a foolish pride To stand upon her honour, and so died. 'Twas a strange trick of her. Few of your ladies</LINE>
<LINE>In ordinary will believe it. They abhor it.</LINE>
<LINE>They&#8217;ll sooner kill themselves with lust than for it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. FEL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We have done the king good service to kill him. More than we were aware on; but this news Will make a mad court. 'Twill be a hard office To be a flatterer now. His grace will run</LINE>
<LINE>Into so many moods there'll be no finding on him:</LINE>
<LINE>As good seek a wild hare without a hound now.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Speaks to corpse of Sophonirus.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>A vengeance of your babbling! These old fellows</LINE>
<LINE>Will harken after secrets as their lives,</LINE>
<LINE>But keep &#8216;em in e&#8217;en as they keep their wives.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GOV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">What a comfort &#8216;tis</LINE>
<LINE>To see &#8216;em gone without her! Faith, she told me Her everlasting sleep would bring me joy, Yet I was still unwilling to believe her, Her life was so sweet to me: like some man</LINE>
<LINE>In time of sickness that would rather wish</LINE>
<LINE>(To please his fearful flesh) his former health</LINE>
<LINE>Restored to him than death; when, after trial,</LINE>
<LINE>If it were possible, ten thousand worlds</LINE>
<LINE>Could not entice him to return again</LINE>
<LINE>And walk upon the earth from whence he flew;</LINE>
<LINE>So stood my wish, joyed in her life and breath,</LINE>
<LINE>Now gone, there is no heav&#8217;n but after death.</LINE>
<LINE>Come, thou delicious treasure of mankind:</LINE>
<LINE>To him that knows what virtuous woman is,</LINE>
<LINE>And can discreetly love her. The whole world</LINE>
<LINE>Yields not a jewel like her, ransack rocks</LINE>
<LINE>And caves beneath the deep. O, thou fair spring</LINE>
<LINE>Of honest and religious desires,</LINE>
<LINE>Fountain of weeping honour, I will kiss thee</LINE>
<LINE>After death&#8217;s marble lip! Thou'rt cold enough</LINE>
<LINE>To lie entombed now by my father&#8217;s side</LINE>
<LINE>Without offense in kindred. There I&#8217;ll place thee</LINE>
<LINE>With one I loved the dearest next to thee.</LINE>
<LINE>Help me to mourn, all that love chastity.</LINE>

<LINE>I'faith, &#8216;twas strangely done, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I confess it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WIFE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is that enough to help it, sir? 'Tis easy to draw a lady&#8217;s honour in suspicion,</LINE>
<LINE>But not so soon recovered and confirmed</LINE>
<LINE>To the first faith again from whence you brought it. Your wit was fetched out about other business, or such forgetfulness had never seized you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Twas but an overflowing, a spring tide</LINE>
<LINE>In my affection, raised by too much love;</LINE>
<LINE>And that&#8217;s the worst words you can give it, madam.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WIFE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Jealous of me!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Life, you'd a' sworn yourself, madam,</LINE>
<LINE>Had you been in my body, and changed cases, To see a fellow with a guilty pace</LINE>
<LINE>Glide through the room, his face three-quarters nighted,</LINE>
<LINE>As if a deed of darkness had hung on him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WIFE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I tell you twice, &#8216;twas my bold woman&#8217;s friend. He&#8217;ll take her impudence!</LINE>

<LINE>Y'ave done too late, sir. Who shall do the rest now?</LINE>
<LINE>Confessed me yielding! Was thy way too free?</LINE>
<LINE>Why, didst thou long to be restrained? Pray, speak, sir!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A man cannot cozen you of the sin of weakness, Or borrow it of a woman for one hour, But how he&#8217;s wondered at. Where, search your lives, we shall ne&#8217;er find it from you; we can suffer you</LINE>
<LINE>To play away our days in idleness, And hide your imperfections with our loves, Or the most part of you would appear strange creatures; And now &#8216;tis but our chance to make an offer,</LINE>
<LINE>And snatch at folly, running, yet to see</LINE>
<LINE>How earnest y&#8217;are against us, as if we had robbed you Or the best gift your natural mother left you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WIFE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis worth a kiss, i&#8217;faith, and thou shalt ha&#8216;t,</LINE>
<LINE>Were there not one more left for my lord&#8217;s supper. And now, sir, I've bethought myself.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">I&#8217;ll say so too,</LINE>
<LINE>To give you encouragement and advance your virtues 'Tis not good always to keep down a woman.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WIFE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, sir, since y'ave begun to make my lord A doubtful man of me, keep on that course, And ply his faith still with that poor belief That I&#8217;m inclining unto wantonness. Take heed you pass no further now.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Why, dost think</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll be twice mad together in one moon? That were too much for any freeman&#8217;s son After his father&#8217;s funeral.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WIFE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Well, then thus, sir,</LINE>
<LINE>Upholding still the same, as being emboldened</LINE>
<LINE>By some loose glance of mine, you shall attempt</LINE>
<LINE>(After y'ave placed my lord in some near closet) To thrust yourself into my chamber rudely, As if the game went forward to your thinking, Then leave the rest to me. I&#8217;ll so reward thee</LINE>
<LINE>With bitterness of wordsâ€”but prithee pardon &#8216;emâ€”</LINE>
<LINE>My lord shall swear me into honesty</LINE>
<LINE>Enough to serve his mind all his life after.</LINE>
<LINE>Nay, for a need, I&#8217;ll draw some rapier forth,</LINE>
<LINE>That shall come near my hand as &#8216;twere by chance,</LINE>
<LINE>And set a lively face upon my rage,</LINE>
<LINE>But fear thou nothing. I too dearly love thee</LINE>
<LINE>To let harm touch thee.</LINE>

<LINE>How come you by such impudence alate, minion?</LINE>
<LINE>Y'are not content to entertain your playfellow</LINE>
<LINE>In your own chamber closely, which I think</LINE>
<LINE>Is large allowance for a lady&#8217;s woman.</LINE>
<LINE>There&#8217;s many a good knight&#8217;s daughter is in service</LINE>
<LINE>And cannot get such favor of her mistress</LINE>
<LINE>But what she has by stealth; she and the chambermaid</LINE>

<LINE>O, the wrongs</LINE>
<LINE>That ladies do their honours when they make Their slaves familiar with their weaknesses! They're ever thus rewarded for that deed; They stand in fear e&#8217;en of the groom they feed. I must be forced to speak my woman fair now, And be first friends with her. Nay, all too little. She may undo me at her pleasure else; She knows the way so well, myself not better, My wanton folly made a key for her To all the private treasure of my heart; She may do what she list.</LINE>

<LINE>One thing I had forgot; I prithee, wench,</LINE>
<LINE>Steal to Votarius closely, and remember him To wear some privy armour then about him, That I may feign a fury without fear.</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<SPEAKER>WIFE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">See now, I chid thee</LINE>
<LINE>When I least thought upon thee: thou'rt my best hand.</LINE>
<LINE>I cannot be without thee. Thus then, sirrah:</LINE>
<LINE>To bear away suspicion from the thoughts</LINE>
<LINE>Of ruder-list'ning servants about house,</LINE>
<LINE>I have advised Votarius at fit time</LINE>
<LINE>Boldly to force his way into my chamber,</LINE>
<LINE>The admittance being denied him, and the passage</LINE>
<LINE>Kept strict by thee, my necessary woman.</LINE>
<LINE>(La! There I should ha&#8217; missed thy help again!)</LINE>
<LINE>At which attempt I&#8217;ll take occasion</LINE>
<LINE>To dissemble such an anger that the world</LINE>
<LINE>Shall ever after swear us to their thoughts</LINE>
<LINE>As clear and free from any fleshly knowledge, As nearest kindred are, or ought to be, Or what can more express it, if that failed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>You know I&#8217;m always at your service, madam, But why some privy armour?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WIFE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Marry, sweetheart,</LINE>
<LINE>The best is yet forgotten; thou shalt hang A weapon in some corner of the chamber, Yonder, or thereâ€”</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Or anywhere. Why, i&#8217;faith, madam,</LINE>
<LINE>Do you think I&#8217;m to learn how to hang a weapon? As much as I&#8217;m uncapable of what follows,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She trusts me now to cast a mist, forsooth, Before the servants&#8217; eyes. I must remember</LINE>

<LINE>Into her chamber, when with feigned fury</LINE>
<LINE>And rapier drawn, which I must lay a purpose</LINE>
<LINE>Ready for her dissemblance, she will seem</LINE>

<LINE>Mark what I say to thee; forget of purpose That privy armour; do not bless his soul With so much warning, nor his hated body</LINE>

<LINE>Lay some empoisoned weapon next her hand,</LINE>
<LINE>That in that play he may be lost forever.</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8216;d have him kept no longer; away with him!</LINE>

Yet he preserved her body dead in honey And kept her long after her funeral. But I&#8217;ll unlock the treasure-house of art With keys of gold and bestow all on thee.

<LINE>Nor none she cares for.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TYR.</SPEAKER>
<STAGEDIR>Aside.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE offset="4">I am overmatched here.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GOV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A lower chamber with less noise were kindlier For her, poor woman, whatsoe'er she was.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TYR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But how if we be pleased to have it thus,</LINE>
<LINE>And thee well hired to do what we command?</LINE>
<LINE>Is not your work for money?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GOV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, my lord;</LINE>
<LINE>I would not trust at court and I could choose.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TYR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let but thy art hide death upon her face, That now looks fearfully on us, and but strive</LINE>
<LINE>To give our eye delight in that pale part</LINE>
<LINE>Which draws so many pities from these springs,</LINE>
<LINE>And thy reward for&#8216;t shall outlast thy end,</LINE>
<LINE>And reach to thy friend&#8217;s fortunes, and his friend.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GOV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Say you so, my lord? I&#8217;ll work out my heart then But I&#8217;ll show art enough.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TYR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">About it, then!</LINE>
<LINE>I never wished so seriously for health After long sickness.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GOV.</SPEAKER>
<STAGEDIR>Aside.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>A religious trembling shakes me by the hand, And bids me put by such unhallowed business, But revenge calls for&#8216;t, and it must go forward.</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis time the spirit of my love took rest; Poor soul, &#8216;tis weary, much abused and toiled.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Govianus paints the face of the body</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TYR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Could I now send for one to renew heat Within her bosom, that were a fine workman;</LINE>
<LINE>I should but too much love him. But alas,</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis as unpossible for living fire</LINE>
<LINE>To take hold there as for dead ashes to burn back again</LINE>
<LINE>Into those hard tough bodies whence they fell.</LINE>
<LINE>Life is removed from her now, as the warmth</LINE>
<LINE>Of the bright sun from us when it makes winter</LINE>
<LINE>And kills with unkind coldness. So is&#8216;t yonder; An everlasting frost hangs now upon her. And in such a season men will force A heat into their bloods with exercise</LINE>
<LINE>In spite of extreme weather, so shall we</LINE>
<LINE>By art force beauty on yon lady&#8217;s face; Though death sit frowning on&#8217;t a storm of hail To beat it off, our pleasure shall prevail.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GOV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TYR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Hast done so soon?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GOV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">That&#8217;s as your grace</LINE>
<LINE>Gives approbation.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TYR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">O, she lives again!</LINE>
<LINE>She'll presently speak to me. Keep her up; I&#8217;ll have her swoon no more; there&#8217;s treachery in&#8216;t. Does she not feel warm to thee?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GOV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Very little, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TYR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The heat wants cherishing then. Our arms and lips</LINE>
<LINE>Shall labour life into her. Wake, sweet mistress!</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>He kisses the lips of the body.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>'Tis I that call thee at the door of life. Ha! I talk so long to death, I&#8217;m sick myself. Methinks an evil scent still follows me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GOV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Maybe &#8216;tis nothing but the colour, sir, That I laid on.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TYR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Is that so strong?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GOV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Yes, faith, sir,</LINE>
<LINE>'Twas the best poison I could get for money.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Govianus throws off his disguise.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TYR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Govianus!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GOV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="3">O, thou sacrilegious villain!</LINE>
<LINE>Thou thief of rest, robber of monuments! Cannot the body after funeral</LINE>
<LINE>Sleep in the grave for thee? Must it be raised</LINE>
<LINE>Only to please the wickedness of thine eye?</LINE>
<LINE>Does all things end with death, and not thy lust?</LINE>
<LINE>Hast thou devised a new way to damnation,</LINE>
<LINE>More dreadful than the soul of any sin</LINE>
<LINE>Did ever pass yet between earth and hell?</LINE>
<LINE>Dost strive to be particularly plagued Above all ghosts beside? Is thy pride such</LINE>
<LINE>Thou scorn&#8217;st a partner in thy torments too?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TYR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What fury gave thee boldness to attempt</LINE>
<LINE>This deed? For which I&#8217;ll doom thee with a death</LINE>
<LINE>Beyond the Frenchmen&#8217;s tortures.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GOV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">I smile at thee.</LINE>
<LINE>Draw all the death that ever mankind suffered Unto one head, to help thine own invention, And make my end as rare as this thy sin,</LINE>
<LINE>And full as fearful to the eyes of women!</LINE>
<LINE>My spirit shall fly singing to his lodging</LINE>
<LINE>In midst of that rough weather. Doom me, Tyrant.</LINE>
<LINE>Had I feared death, I&#8216;d never appeared noble</LINE>
<LINE>To seal this act upon me, which e&#8217;en honours me</LINE>
<LINE>Unto my mistress&#8217; spirit. It loves me for&#8216;t.</LINE>
<LINE>I told my heart &#8216;twould prove destruction to&#8217;t.</LINE>
<LINE>Who, hearing &#8216;twas for her, charged me to do&#8216;t.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TYR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thy glories shall be shortened! Who&#8217;s within there?</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter the Ghost, in the same form as the Lady is dressed in the chair.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>I called not thee, thou enemy to firmness, Mortality&#8217;s earthquake!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GOV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Welcome to mine eyes</LINE>
<LINE>As is the day spring from the morning&#8217;s womb Unto that wretch whose nights are tedious!</LINE>
<LINE>As liberty to captives, health to labourers,</LINE>
<LINE>And life still to old people, never weary on&#8217;t;</LINE>
<LINE>So welcome art thou to me. The deed&#8217;s done,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou queen of spirits; he has his end upon him.</LINE>
<LINE>Thy body shall return to rise again,</LINE>
<LINE>For thy abuser falls, and has no power</LINE>
<LINE>To vex thee farther now.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LADY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">My truest love!</LINE>
<LINE>Life ever honoured here, and blessed above.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TYR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, if there be a hell for flesh and spirit, 'Us built within this bosom.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter Nobles.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>My lords, treason!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GOV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now death, I&#8217;m for thee. Welcome!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TYR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">Your king&#8217;s poisoned!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MEMP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The King of heaven be praised for&#8216;t!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TYR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">Lay hold on himâ€”</LINE>
<LINE>On Govianus!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MEMP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">E&#8217;en with the best loves</LINE>
<LINE>And truest hearts that ever subjects owed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TYR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How&#8217;s that? I charge you all, lay hands on him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MEMP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Look you, my lord, your will shall be obeyed:</LINE>
<LINE>Here comes another; we'll have his hand too.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Helvetius.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You shall have both mine, if that work go forward, Beside my voice and knee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TYR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">Helvetius!</LINE>
<LINE>Then my destruction was confirmed amongst &#8216;em;</LINE>
<LINE>Premeditation wrought it. O my torments!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Live Govianus long our virtuous king!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>A flourish.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TYR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That thunder strikes me dead.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>The Tyrant dies.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GOV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">I cannot better</LINE>
<LINE>Reward my joys than with astonished silence, For all the wealth of words is not of power</LINE>
<LINE>To make up thanks for you, my honoured lords!</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;m like a man plucked up from many waters, That never looked for help, and am here placed Upon this cheerful mountain, where prosperity</LINE>
<LINE>Shoots forth her richest beam.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MEMP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Long-injured lord,</LINE>
<LINE>The tyranny of his actions grew so weighty,</LINE>
<LINE>His life so viciousâ€”</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">To which this is witness-</LINE>
<LINE>Monster in sin!â€”this, the disquieted body Of my too resolute child in honour&#8217;s war.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MEMP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>â€”That he became as hateful to our mindsâ€”</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HELV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As death&#8217;s unwelcome to a house of riches,</LINE>
<LINE>Or what can more express it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GOV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Well, he&#8217;s gone;</LINE>
<LINE>And all the kingdom&#8217;s evils perish with him! And since the body of that virtuous lady Is taken from her rest, in memory</LINE>
<LINE>Of her admired mistress, &#8216;tis our will</LINE>
<LINE>It receive honour dead, as it took part</LINE>
<LINE>With us in all afflictions when it lived.</LINE>
<LINE>Here place her in this throne, crown her our queen,</LINE>
<LINE>The first and last that ever we make ours,</LINE>
<LINE>Her constancy strikes so much firmness in us.</LINE>
<LINE>That honour done, let her be solemnly borne Unto the house of peace from whence she came, As Queen of Silence.</LINE>
<LINE>The Spirit enters again and stays to go out with the body, as if it were attending it</LINE>
<LINE>O welcome, blessed spirit! Thou need&#8217;st not mistrust me; I have a care</LINE>
<LINE>As jealous as thine own. We'll see it done,</LINE>
<LINE>And not believe report; our zeal is such</LINE>
<LINE>We cannot reverence chastity too much.</LINE>
<LINE>Lead on! I would those ladies that fill honour&#8217;s rooms</LINE>
<LINE>Might all be borne so honest to their tombs.</LINE>
<LINE>Recorders or other solemn music plays them out.</LINE>
