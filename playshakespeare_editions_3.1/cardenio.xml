<speaker>TYR.</speaker>
<line>Thus high, my lords, your powers and constant loves</line>
<line>Hath fixed our glories like unmov&#8217;d stars</line>
<line>That know not what it is to fall or err.</line>
<line>We&#8217;re the kingdom&#8217;s love, and he that was</line>
<line>Flattered awhile, so stands before us now</line>
<line>Readier for doom than dignity.</line>

<speaker>GOV.</speaker>
<line offset="5">So much</line>
<line>Can the adulterate friendship of mankind,</line>
<line>False Fortune&#8217;s sister, bring to pass on kings, And lay usurpers sunning in their glories Like adders in warm beams.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TYR.</speaker>
<line offset="5">There was but one</line>
<line>In whom my heart took pleasure (amongst women), One in the whole creation, and in her You dared to be my rival! Was&#8217;t not bold? Now we are king, she'll leave the lower path And find the way to us. Helvetius! It is thy daughter. Happier than a king And far above him, for she kneels to thee Whom we have kneeled to, richer in one smile That came from her than she in all thy blessings! If thou be&#8217;st proud, thou art to be forgiven;</line>
<line>It is no deadly sin in thee. While she lives,</line>
<line>High lust is not more natural to youth</line>
<line>Than that to thee. Be not afraid to die in&#8216;t;</line>
<line>'Tis but the sign of joy. There is no gladness</line>
<line>But has a pride it lives by. That&#8217;s the oil</line>
<line>That feeds it into flames. Let her be sent for</line>
<line>And honorably attended, as beseems</line>
<line>Her that we make our queen. My lords Memphonius</line>
<line>And Sophonirus, take into your care</line>
<line>The royal business of my heart. Conduct her</line>
<line>With a respect equal with that to us.</line>
<line>If more, it shall be pardoned; so still err,</line>
<line>You honour us, but ourself honours her.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MEMP.</speaker>
<stagedir>Aside.</stagedir>
<line>Strange fortune! Does he make his queen of her?</line>
<stagedir>Exit Memphonius.</stagedir>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SOPH.</speaker>
<line>I have a wife; would she were so preferred! I could be but her subject; so I&#8217;m now:</line>
<line>I allow her her one friend to stop her mouth</line>
<line>And keep her quiet, gi' him his table free,</line>
<line>And the huge feeding of his great stone horse</line>
<line>On which he rides in pomp about the city</line>
<line>Only to speak to gallants in bay-windows.</line>
<line>Marry, his lodging he pays dearly for;</line>
<line>He gets me all my children; there I save by&#8216;t.</line>
<line>Besides I draw my life out by the bargain</line>
<line>Some twelve years longer than the times appointed;</line>
<line>When my young prodigal gallant kicks up&#8217;s heels</line>
<line>At one-and-thirty, and lies dead and rotten</line>
<line>Some five-and-forty years before I&#8217;m coffined.</line>
<line>'Tis the right way to keep a woman honest:</line>
<line>One friend is barricado to a hundred</line>
<line>And keeps &#8216;em out. Nay more, a husband&#8217;s sure</line>
<line>To have his children all of one man&#8217;s getting,</line>
<line>And he that performs best can have no better.</line>
<line>I&#8217;m e&#8217;en as happy then that save a labour.</line>

<speaker>TYR.</speaker>
<stagedir>To Helvetius.</stagedir>
<line>Thy honours with thy daughter&#8217;s love shall rise. I shall read thy deservings in her eyes.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>HELV.</speaker>
<line>O may they be eternal books of pleasure</line>
<line>To show you all delight!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GOV.</speaker>
<line>The loss of her sits closer to my heart Than that of kingdom or the whorish pomp Of this world&#8217;s titles, that with flattery swells us And makes us die like beasts fat for destruction.</line>
<line>But when she turns her head by chance and sees The fortunes that are my companions,</line>
<line>She'll snatch her eyes off and repent the looking.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TYR.</speaker>
<line>'Tis well advised: we doom thee, Govianus, To banishment forever from our kingdom.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GOV.</speaker>
<line>What could be worse to one whose heart is locked Up in another&#8217;s bosom! Banishment!</line>
<line>And why not death? Is that too easy for me?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TYR.</speaker>
<line>But that the world would call our way to dignity</line>
<line>A path of blood, it should be the first act in all our reign.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GOV.</speaker>
<line>She&#8217;s lost forever!</line>
<line>To Nobles Farewell, virtuous men, Too honest for your greatness. Now y&#8217;are mightier Than when we knew the kingdom; your style&#8217;s heavier.</line>
<line>Then, ponderous nobility, farewell!</line>

<speaker>1. NOBLE.</speaker>
<line offset="5">How&#8217;s that, sir?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GOV.</speaker>
<line>Weighty and serious!â€”O, sir, is it you?</line>
<line>When your discretion sucked; is&#8216;t come from nurse yet?</line>
<line>You seem to be a scholar; you were born better.</line>
<line>You have good lands; that&#8217;s the best grounds of learning.</line>
<line>If you can conster but your doctor&#8217;s bill,</line>
<line>Pierce your wife&#8217;s waiting-women, and decline your tenants</line>
<line>Till they're all beggars with new fines and rackings,</line>
<line>Y'are scholar good enough for a lady&#8217;s son</line>
<line>That&#8217;s born to living. If you list to read,</line>
<line>Ride but to th' city and bestow your looks</line>
<line>On the court library, the mercers&#8217; books;</line>
<line>They&#8217;ll quickly furnish you: do but entertain</line>
<line>A tailor for your tutor to expound</line>
<line>All the hard stuff to you, by what name and title</line>
<line>Soever they be called.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. NOBLE.</speaker>
<line offset="5">I thank you, sir.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GOV.</speaker>
<line>'Tis happy you have learnt so much manners, Since you have so little wit. Fare you well, sir!</line>

<line offset="9">Stay!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. NOBLE.</speaker>
<line offset="5">You must stay, sir.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GOV.</speaker>
<line>He&#8217;s not so honest, sure, to change his mind, Revoke his doom. Hell has more hope on him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TYR.</speaker>
<line>We have not ended yet; the worst part&#8217;s coming: Thy banishment were gentle were that all. But t'afflict thy soul, before thou goest Thou shalt behold the heaven that thou must lose In her that must be mine. Then to be banished, then to be deprived, Shows the full torment we provide for thee.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GOV.</speaker>
<line>Here&#8217;s a right tyrant now; he will not bate me Th'affliction of my soul; he'll have all parts Suffer together.</line>
<stagedir>Enter the Nobles with the Lady clad in black.</stagedir>
<line>Now I see my loss; I never shall recover&#8216;t; my mind&#8217;s beggared.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TYR.</speaker>
<line>Black! Whence risse that cloud? Can such a</line>
<line>thing be seen</line>
<line>In honour&#8217;s glorious day, the sky so clear?</line>
<line>Why mourns the kingdom&#8217;s mistress? Does she come</line>
<line>To meet advancement in a funeral garment?</line>
<line>Back! She forgot herself. 'Twas too much joy</line>
<line>That bred this error, and we heartily pardon&#8217;t.</line>
<line>To the attending Nobles Go, bring me her hither like an illustrious bride With her best beams about her. Let her jewels Be worth ten cities; that beseems our mistress, And not a widow&#8217;s case, a suit to weep in.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LADY.</speaker>
<line>I am not to be altered.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TYR.</speaker>
<line offset="5">How!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LADY.</speaker>
<line offset="5">I have a mind</line>
<line>That must be shifted ere I cast off these, Or else I shall wear strange colours. 'Tis not titles, Nor all the bastard honours of this frame That I am taken with. I come not hither</line>
<line>To please the eye of glory, but of goodness;</line>
<line>And that concerns not you, sir; you're for greatness I dare not deal with you: I have found my match, And I will never lose him.</line>
<line>Looks at Govianus</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GOV.</speaker>
<line>If there be man Above a king in fortunes, read my story</line>
<line>And you shall find him there. Farewell, poor kingdom!</line>
<line>To the Tyrant Take it to help thee; thou hast need on&#8217;t now. I see thee in distress, more miserable Than some thou lay&#8217;st taxations on, poor subjects! Th'art all beset with storms, more overcast</line>
<line>Than ever any man that brightness flattered.</line>
<line>Tis only wretchedness to be there with thee, And happiness to be here.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TYR.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Sure some dream crowned me.</line>
<line>If it were possible to be less than nothing, I wake the man you seek for. There&#8217;s the kingdom Within yon valley fixed, while I stand here</line>
<line>Kissing false hopes upon a frozen mountain, Without the confines. I am he that&#8217;s banished. The king walks yonder, chose by her affection, Which is the surer side, for where she goes</line>
<line>Her eye removes the court. What is he here</line>
<line>Can spare a look? They're all employed on her. Helvetius! Thou art not worth the waking neither; I lose but time in thee. Go sleep again: Like an old man, thou can&#8217;st do nothing;</line>
<line>Thou tak&#8217;st no pains at all to earn thine honours</line>
<line>Which way shall we be able to pay thee</line>
<line>To thy content, when we receive not ours?</line>
<line>The master of the work must needs decay</line>
<line>When he wants means, and sees his servant play.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HELV.</speaker>
<line offset="5">To the Lady</line>
<line>Have I bestowed so many blessings on thee,</line>
<line>And do they all return to me in curses? Is that the use I ha&#8217; for &#8216;em? Be not to me A burden ten times heavier than my years! Thou'd&#8217;st wont to be kind to me and observe</line>
<line>What I thought pleasing. Go, entreat the king!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LADY.</speaker>
<line>I will do more for you, sir; y&#8217;are my father; I&#8217;ll kiss him, too.</line>
<line>She kisses Govianus</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HELV.</speaker>
<line offset="5">How am I dealt withal?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LADY.</speaker>
<line>Why that&#8217;s the usurper, sir; this is the king. I happened lighter than you thought I had.</line>
<line>And were all kingdoms of the earth his own,</line>
<line>As sure as this is not, and this dear gentleman</line>
<line>As poor as virtue and almost as friendless,</line>
<line>I would not change this misery for that sceptre</line>
<line>Wherein I had part with him. Sir, be cheerfiil.</line>
<line>'Tis not the reeling fortune of great state</line>
<line>Or low condition that I cast mine eye at. It is the man I seek; the rest I lose As things unworthy to be kept or noted. Fortunes are but the outsides of true worth.</line>
<line>It is the mind that sets his master forth.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TYR.</speaker>
<line>Has there so many bodies been hewn down Like trees in progress, to cut out a way That was ne&#8217;er known, for us and our affections, And is our game so crossed? There stands the first Of all her kind that ever refused greatnessâ€”</line>
<line>A woman to set light by sovereignty! What age can bring her forth, and hide that book? 'Tis their desire most commonly to rule More than their part comes toâ€”sometimes their husbands.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HELV.</speaker>
<line>'Tis in your power, my lord, to force her to you</line>
<line>And pluck her from his arms.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TYR.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Thou talk&#8217;st unkindly.</line>
<line>That had been done before thy thought begot it If my affection could be so hard-hearted To stand upon such payment. It must come</line>
<line>Gently and kindly, like a debt of love,</line>
<line>Or &#8216;tis not worth receiving.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GOV.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Now usurper,</line>
<line>I wish not happier freedom than the banishment That thou hast laid upon me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TYR.</speaker>
<stagedir>Aside.</stagedir>
<line>O, he kills me</line>
<line>At mine own weapon! 'Tis I that live in exile. Should she forsake the land, I&#8217;ll feign some cause</line>
<line>Far from the grief itself to call it back.</line>
<stagedir>To Govianus.</stagedir>
<line>That doom of banishment was but lent to thee To make a trial of thy factious spirit, Which flames in thy desire. Thou wouldst be gone. There is some combination betwixt thee</line>
<line>And foreign plots; thou hast some powers to raise, Which, to prevent, thy banishment we revoke,</line>
<line>Confine thee to thy house nearest our court, And place a guard about thee. Lord Memphonius, See it effected.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MEMP.</speaker>
<line>With best care, my lord.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GOV.</speaker>
<line>Confine me? Here&#8217;s my liberty in mine arms; I wish no better to bring me content. Love&#8217;s best freedom is close prisonment!</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exeunt Lady and Govianus.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>TYR.</speaker>
<line>Methinks the day e&#8217;en darkens at her absence.</line>
<line>I stand as in a shade, when a great cloud</line>
<line>Muffles the sun, whose beams shine afar off On tow'rs and mountains; But I keep the valleys, The place that is last served.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HELV.</speaker>
<line>My lord!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TYR.</speaker>
<line>Your reason, sir?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HELV.</speaker>
<line>Your grace is mild to all but your own bosom. They should have both been sent to several prisons, And not committed to each other&#8217;s arms. There&#8217;s a hot durance! He'll ne&#8217;er wish more freedom!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TYR.</speaker>
<line>'Tis true; let &#8216;em be both forced back. Stay, we command you!</line>
<line>Thou talk&#8217;st not like a statesman. Had my wrath Took hold of such extremity at first, They'd lived suspectful still, warned by their fears; Where, now that liberty makes &#8216;em more secure, I&#8217;ll take &#8216;em at my pleasure. It gives thee Freer access to play the father for us, And ply her to our will.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HELV.</speaker>
<line>Mass, so it does.</line>
<line>Let a man think on&#8217;t twice, your grace hath happened Upon a strange way, yet it proves the nearest.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TYR.</speaker>
<line>Nay, more to vex his soul, give command straight</line>
<line>They be divided into several rooms,</line>
<line>Where he may only have a sight of her To his mind&#8217;s torment, but his arms and lips Locked up like felons from her.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HELV.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Now you win me.</line>
<line>I like that cruelty passing well, my lord.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TYR.</speaker>
<line>Give order with all speed.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HELV.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Though I be old,</line>
<line>I need no spur, my lord; honour pricks me. I do beseech your grace look cheerfully. You shall not want content if it be locked In any blood of mine. The key&#8217;s your own. You shall command the words.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TYR.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Say&#8217;st thou so, sir?</line>

<line>They're fellow prisoners, though the sea looks bigger</line>

<line>Our ladies are good people, and so live with &#8216;em:</line>
<line>A fine security for them! Our own thoughts Make the best fools of us; next to them, our wives.</line>
<line>But say she&#8217;s all chaste, yet is that her goodness?</line>
<line>What labour is&#8216;t for a woman to keep constant</line>
<line>That&#8217;s never tried or tempted? Where&#8217;s her fight?</line>
<line>The war&#8217;s within her breast, her honest anger</line>
<line>Against the impudence of flesh and hell:</line>
<line>So let me know the lady of my rest,</line>
<line>Or I shall never sleep well. Give not me</line>
<line>The thing that is thought good, but what&#8217;s approved so:</line>

But let the boldest ruffian touch the ear Of modest ladies with adulterous sounds, Their very looks confound him and force grace Into that cheek where impudence sets her seal. That work is never undertook with courage That makes his master blush. However, sir, What profit can return to you by knowing That which you do already, with more toil? That a man needs, in having a rich diamond, Put it between a hammer and an anvil, And not believing the true worth and value, Break it in pieces to find out the goodness, And in the finding lose it? Good sir, think on&#8217;t! Nor does it taste of wit to try their strengths That are created sickly, nor of manhood. we ought not to put blocks in women&#8217;s ways, For some too often fall upon plain ground. Let me dissuade you, sir!</line>

<line>Yet, sir, there is a date set to all sorrows. Nothing is everlasting in this world. Your counsel will prevail: persuade him, good sir, To fall into life&#8217;s happiness again, And leave the desolate path. I want his company: He walks at midnight in thick shady [dark] woods Where scarce the moon is starlight. I have watched him In silver nights when all the earth was dressed Up like a virgin in white innocent beams; Stood in my window cold and thinly clad T'observe him through the bounty of the moon That liberally bestowed her graces on me. And when the morning dew began to fall, Then was my time to weep. H&#8217;as lost his kindness, Forgot the way of wedlock, and become A stranger to the joys and rites of love. He&#8217;s not so good as a lord ought to be. Pray tell him so from me, sir. Exit Wife</line>

<line>Call you this courting? Life, not one word near it! There was no syllable but was twelve score off. My faith, hot temptation! Woman&#8217;s chastity</line>
<line>In such a conflict had great need of one</line>
<line>To keep the bridge. 'Twas dangerous for the time.</line>
<line>Why, what fantastic faiths are in these days</line>
<line>Made without substance! Whom should a man trust</line>

<speaker>VOT.</speaker>
<line>You set me to a task, sir, that will find Ten ages work enough, and then unfinished. Bring sin before her! Why, it stands more quaking Than if a judge should frown on&#8217;t. Three such fits Would shake it into goodness, and quite beggar</line>

<speaker>VOT.</speaker>
<line offset="5">How, my lord!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANS.</speaker>
<line>Thou art the son of falsehood. Prithee, leave me. How truly constant, charitable, and helpful Is woman unto woman in affairs</line>
<line>That touch affection and the peace of spirit;</line>
<line>But man to man, how crooked and unkind; I thank my jealousy I heard thee all, For I heard nothing; now thou'it sure I did.</line>

<speaker>VOT.</speaker>
<line>Now by this light, then, wipe but off this score,</line>
<line>Since y&#8217;are so bent, and if I ever run</line>

<line>He would be but too rich.</line>
<line>Man has some enemy still that keeps him back</line>
<line>In all his fortunes, and his mind is his,</line>
<line>And that&#8217;s a mighty adversary. I had rather</line>
<line>Have twenty kings my enemies than that part;</line>
<line>For let me be at war with earth and hell So that be friends with me! I ha&#8217; sworn to make A trial of her faith. I must put on A courtier&#8217;s face and do&#8216;t; mine own will shame me.</line>

<line>What&#8217;s the news, sweet madam?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WIFE.</speaker>
<line>H&#8217;as took his horse, but left his leave untaken. What should I think on&#8217;t, sir? Did ever lord Depart so rudely from his lady&#8217;s presence?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VOT.</speaker>
<line>Did he forget your lip?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WIFE.</speaker>
<line>That nobleness remembers.</line>
<line>He forgot all</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VOT.</speaker>
<line>I&#8217;m ashamed on him.</line>
<line>Let me help, madam, to repair his manners, And mend that unkind fault.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WIFE.</speaker>
<line>Sir! Pray, forbear!</line>
<line>You forget worse than he.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VOT.</speaker>
<stagedir>Aside.</stagedir>
<line>So virtue save me,</line>
<line>I have enough already.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WIFE.</speaker>
<line>Tis himself</line>
<line>Must make amends, good sir, for his own faults.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VOT.</speaker>
<stagedir>Aside.</stagedir>
<line>I would he'd do&#8216;t then, and ne&#8217;er trouble mein&#8216;t.</line>
<stagedir>Aloud.</stagedir>
<line>But, madam, you perceive he takes the course</line>
<line>To be far off from that. He&#8217;s rode from home,</line>
<line>But his unkindness stays, and keeps with you.</line>
<line>Let whose will please his wife; he rides his horse;</line>
<line>That&#8217;s all the care he takes. I pity you, madam;</line>
<line>Y'ave an unpleasing lord. Would &#8216;twere not so.</line>
<line>I should rejoice with you.</line>
<line>You're young, the very spring&#8217;s upon you now.</line>
<line>The roses on your cheeks are but new blown.</line>
<line>Take you together, y&#8217;are a pleasant garden</line>
<line>Where all the sweetness of man&#8217;s comfort breathes.</line>
<line>But what is it to be a work of beauty</line>
<line>And want the heart that should delight in you?</line>
<line>You still retain your goodness in yourself,</line>
<line>But then you lose your glory, which is all.</line>
<line>The grace of every benefit is the use,</line>
<line>And is&#8216;t not pity you should want your grace?</line>
<line>Look you like one whose lord should walk in groves</line>
<line>About the peace of midnight? Alas, madam,</line>
<line>'Tis to me wondrous how you should spare the day</line>
<line>From amorous clips, much less the general season</line>
<line>When all the world&#8217;s a gamester!</line>
<line>That face deserves a friend of heart and spirit,</line>
<line>Discourse, and motion, indeed such a one That should observe you, madam, without ceasing, And not a weary lord.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WIFE.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Sure I was married, sir,</line>
<line>In a dear year of love, when scarcity And famine of affection vexed poor ladies, Which makes my heart so needy. It ne&#8217;er knew Plenty of comfort yet.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VOT.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Why, that&#8217;s your folly,</line>
<line>To keep your mind so miserably, madam. Change into better times; I&#8217;ll lead you to &#8216;em. What bounty shall your friend expect for his?</line>
<line>O you that can be hard to your own heart,</line>
<line>But would you use your friend&#8217;s? If I thought kindly, I&#8216;d be the man myself to serve your pleasure.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WIFE.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Now, sir!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VOT.</speaker>
<line>Nay, and ne&#8217;er miss you, too. I&#8216;d not come sneaking Like a retainer once a week or so To show myself before you for my livery; I&#8216;d follow business like a household servant, Carry my work before me, and dispatch Before my lord be up, and make no words on&#8217;tâ€” The sign of a good servant.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WIFE.</speaker>
<line offset="5">'Tis not friendly done, sir,</line>
<line>To take a lady at advantage thus: Set all her wrongs before her, and then tempt her.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VOT.</speaker>
<stagedir>Aside.</stagedir>
<line>Heart! I grow fond myself! 'Twas well</line>
<line>she waked me</line>
<line>Before the dead sleep of adultery took me; 'Twas stealing on me. Up, you honest thoughts, And keep watch for your master! I must hence.</line>
<line>I do not like my health; &#8216;t'as a strange relish.</line>
<line>Pray heaven I plucked mine eyes back time enough! I&#8217;ll never see her more. I praised the garden But little thought a bed of snakes lay hid in&#8216;t.</line>
<line>He prepares to leave</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WIFE.</speaker>
<stagedir>Aside.</stagedir>
<line>I know not how I am! I&#8217;ll call my womanâ€” Stay, for I fear thou'rt too far gone already.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VOT.</speaker>
<stagedir>Aside.</stagedir>
<line>I&#8217;ll see her but once more. Do thy worst, love!</line>
<line>Thou art too young, fond boy, to master me.</line>
<line>He returns to the Wife I come to tell you, madam, and that plainly I&#8217;ll see your face no more. Take&#8216;t how you please.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WIFE.</speaker>
<line>You will not offer violence to me, sir,</line>
<line>In my lord&#8217;s absence! What does that touch you If I want comfort?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VOT.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Will you take your answer?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WIFE.</speaker>
<line>It is not honest in you to tempt woman:</line>
<line>When her distresses takes away her strength, How is she able to withstand her enemy?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VOT.</speaker>
<line>I would fain leave your sight and I could possible.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WIFE.</speaker>
<line>What is&#8216;t to you, good sir, if I be pleased</line>
<line>To weep myself away, and run thus violently Into the arms of death, and kiss destruction? Does this concern you now?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VOT.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Ay, marry, does it!</line>
<line>What serve these arms for but to pluck you back, These lips but to prevent all other tasters,</line>
<line>And keep that cup of nectar for themselves?</line>
<stagedir>Aside.</stagedir>
<line>Heart, I&#8217;m beguiled again! Forgive me, heav&#8217;n, My lips have been naught with her! Sin&#8217;s mere</line>
<line>witchcraft.</line>
<line>Break all the engines of life&#8217;s frame in pieces, I will be master once, and whip the boy</line>
<line>Home to his mother&#8217;s lap. Face, fare thee well!</line>

<line>I will not bless thee. Thy obedience</line>

<line>Able to make a latter spring in me</line>
<line>In this my fourscore summer, and renew me</line>
<line>With a reversion yet of heat and youth!</line>
<line>But the dejection of thy mind and spirit</line>
<line>Makes me, thy father, guilty of a fault</line>
<line>That draws thy birth in question, and e&#8217;en wrongs</line>
<line>Thy mother in her ashes, being at peace</line>
<line>With heaven and man. Had not her life and virtues</line>

<line>That since thou wilt not yield to be his queen, Be yet his mistress. He shall be content with that or nothing; he shall ask no more And with what easiness that is performed Most of your women know. Having a husband, That kindness costs thee nothing: y'ave that in All over and above to your first bargain, And that&#8217;s a brave advantage for a woman If she be wise, as I suspect not thee. And having youth, and beauty, and a husband, Thou&#8217;st all the wish of woman. Take thy time, then; Make thy best market.</line>

<line>Whether my father spake this? Or some spirit Of evil-wishing that has for a time Hired his voice of him to beguile me that way,</line>

<stagedir>Helvetius falls.</stagedir>
<line>Art down but with the bare voice of my fury? Up, ancient sinner! Thou'it but mocked with death. I missed thee purposely; thank this dear creature.</line>
<line>O, hadst thou been anything beside her father I&#8216;d made a fearful separation on thee. I would have sent thy soul to a darker prison Than any made of clay, and thy dead body</line>
<line>As a token to the lustful king thy master.</line>
<line>Art thou struck down so soon with the short sound Of this small earthen instrument, and dost thou So little fear th' eternal noise of hell?</line>
<line>What&#8217;s she? Does she not bear thy daughter&#8217;s name?</line>
<line>How stirs thy blood, sir? Is there a dead feeling</line>
<line>Of all things fatherly and honest in thee?</line>
<line>Say thou couldst be content, for greatness&#8217; sake,</line>
<line>To end the last act of thy life in panderism</line>
<line>(As you perhaps will say your betters do),</line>
<line>Must it needs follow that unmanly sin</line>
<line>Can work upon the weakness of no woman</line>
<line>But her whose name and honour natural love</line>
<line>Bids thee preserve more charily than eyesight,</line>
<line>Health, or thy senses? Can promotion&#8217;s thirst</line>
<line>Make such a father? Turn a grave old lord</line>
<line>To a white-headed squire? Make him so base</line>
<line>To buy his honours with his daughter&#8217;s soul</line>
<line>And the perpetual shaming of his blood?</line>
<line>Hast thou the leisure, thou forgetful man,</line>
<line>To think upon advancement at these years?</line>
<line>What wouldst thou do with greatness? Dost thou hope</line>
<line>To fray death with&#8216;t? Or hast thou that conceit</line>
<line>That honour will restore thy youth again?</line>
<line>Thou art but mocked, old fellow! Tis not so;</line>
<line>Thy hopes abuse thee. Follow thine own business</line>
<line>And list not to the sirens of the world.</line>
<line>Alas, thou hadst more need kneel at an altar</line>
<line>Than to a chair of state,</line>
<line>And search thy conscience for thy sins of youth;</line>
<line>That&#8217;s work enough for age; it needs no greater.</line>
<line>Thou'it called within. Thy very eyes look inward</line>
<line>To teach thy thoughts the way, and thy affections.</line>
<line>But miserable notes that conscience sings</line>
<line>That cannot truly pray, for flattering kings.</line>

<line>My sins would look on me! But now truth shows &#8216;em, How loathsome and how monstrous are their forms!</line>

<line>All&#8217;s gone; there&#8217;s nothing but the prodigal left</line>
<line>I have played away my soul at one short game</line>
<line>Where e&#8217;en the winner loses. Pursuing sin, how often did I shun thee! How swift art thou afoot, beyond man&#8217;s goodness, Which has a lazy pace! So was I catched. A curse upon the cause! Man in these days Is not content to have his lady honest And so rest pleased with her without more toil, But he must have her tried, forsooth, and tempted. And when she proves a queen then he lies quiet: Like one that has a watch of curious making, Thinking to be more cunning than the workman, Never gives over tampering with the wheels Till either spring be weakened, balance bowed, Or some wrong pin put in, and so spoils all. How could I curse myself! Most business else Delight in the dispatch, that&#8217;s the best grace to&#8217;t; Only this work of blind, repented lust Hangs shame and sadness on his master&#8217;s cheek, Yet wise men take no warning.</line>

<line>I must not give way first. She&#8217;s my mistress,</line>
<line>And that&#8217;s a degree kinder than a wife.</line>
<line>Women are always better to their friends</line>
<line>Than to their husbands, and more true to them.</line>

<line>This lady will be served like a great woman,</line>
<line>With more attendants, I perceive, than one.</line>
<line>She has her shift of friends. Mine enemy one!</line>
<line>Do we both shun each other&#8217;s company</line>
<line>In all assemblies public, at all meetings,</line>
<line>And drink to one another in one mistress? My very thought&#8217;s my poison. Tis high time To seek for help. Where is our head physician,</line>

<line>O, woman! When thou once leav&#8217;st to be good,</line>
<line>Thou car&#8217;st not who stands next thee. Every sin</line>

But how has rashness and my jealousy used me: Out of my vengeance to mine enemy Confessed her yielding! I have locked myself From mine own liberty with that key. Revenge Does no man good but to his greater harm. Suspect and malice, like a mingled cup, Made me soon drunk. I knew not what I spoke, And that may get me pardon.</line>

<line>To which e&#8217;en kings owe reverence as they're men</line>

<line>How comes the moon to change so in this man,</line>
<line>That was at full but now in all performance, And swifter than my wishes? I beshrew that virtue that busied herself with him: she might have found Some other work. The man was fit for me</line>
<line>Before she spoiled him. She has wronged my heart in&#8216;t</line>
<line>And marred me a good workman. Now his art fails him,</line>
<line>What makes the man at court? This is no place</line>
<line>For fellows of no parts. He lives not here</line>
<line>That puts himself from action when we need him.</line>
<stagedir>To Helvetius.</stagedir>
<line>I take off all thy honours and bestow &#8216;em</line>

<speaker>SOPH.</speaker>
<line>My lord, that&#8217;s I. Trouble your grace no further. I&#8217;ll undertake to bring her to your bed With some ten words. Marry, they're special charms; No lady can withstand &#8216;em. A witch taught me &#8216;em</line>
<line>If you doubt me, I&#8217;ll leave my wife in pawn For my true loyalty, and your majesty May pass away the time till I return. I have a care in all things.</line>

<line>For field offences; give &#8216;em charge from us</line>

<line>Sir, you do nothing; there&#8217;s no valour in you; Y'are the worst friend to a lady in affliction That ever love made his companion. For honour&#8217;s sake despatch me! Thy own thoughts Should stir thee to this act more than my weakness. The sufferer should not do&#8216;t. I speak thy part, Dull and forgetful man, and all to help thee.

<line offset="5">O, poor lady!</line>
<line>Why might not she expire now in that prayer, Since she must die, and never try worse ways? 'Tis not so happy, for we often see Condemned men sick to death, yet &#8216;tis their fortune To recover to their execution And rise again in health to set in shame. What if I steal a death unseen of her now, And close up all my miseries with mine eyes? O, fie! And leave her here alone! That were unmanly.</line>

Spare not now; Make all the haste you can. I&#8217;ll plant this bawd Against the door, the fittest place for him, That when with ungoverned weapons they rush in, Blinded with fury, they may take his death Into the purple number of their deeds, And wipe it off from mine.

<line>How came this, sir?</line>
<line>The king must know.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GOV.</speaker>
<line offset="5">From yon old fellow&#8217;s prattling.</line>
<line>All your intents he revealed largely to her,</line>
<line>And she was troubled with a foolish pride To stand upon her honour, and so died. 'Twas a strange trick of her. Few of your ladies</line>
<line>In ordinary will believe it. They abhor it.</line>
<line>They&#8217;ll sooner kill themselves with lust than for it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. FEL.</speaker>
<line>We have done the king good service to kill him. More than we were aware on; but this news Will make a mad court. 'Twill be a hard office To be a flatterer now. His grace will run</line>
<line>Into so many moods there'll be no finding on him:</line>
<line>As good seek a wild hare without a hound now.</line>
<stagedir>Speaks to corpse of Sophonirus.</stagedir>
<line>A vengeance of your babbling! These old fellows</line>
<line>Will harken after secrets as their lives,</line>
<line>But keep &#8216;em in e&#8217;en as they keep their wives.</line>

<stagedir>Exeunt Fellows. Manet Govianus.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>GOV.</speaker>
<line offset="5">What a comfort &#8216;tis</line>
<line>To see &#8216;em gone without her! Faith, she told me Her everlasting sleep would bring me joy, Yet I was still unwilling to believe her, Her life was so sweet to me: like some man</line>
<line>In time of sickness that would rather wish</line>
<line>(To please his fearful flesh) his former health</line>
<line>Restored to him than death; when, after trial,</line>
<line>If it were possible, ten thousand worlds</line>
<line>Could not entice him to return again</line>
<line>And walk upon the earth from whence he flew;</line>
<line>So stood my wish, joyed in her life and breath,</line>
<line>Now gone, there is no heav&#8217;n but after death.</line>
<line>Come, thou delicious treasure of mankind:</line>
<line>To him that knows what virtuous woman is,</line>
<line>And can discreetly love her. The whole world</line>
<line>Yields not a jewel like her, ransack rocks</line>
<line>And caves beneath the deep. O, thou fair spring</line>
<line>Of honest and religious desires,</line>
<line>Fountain of weeping honour, I will kiss thee</line>
<line>After death&#8217;s marble lip! Thou'rt cold enough</line>
<line>To lie entombed now by my father&#8217;s side</line>
<line>Without offense in kindred. There I&#8217;ll place thee</line>
<line>With one I loved the dearest next to thee.</line>
<line>Help me to mourn, all that love chastity.</line>

<speaker>VOT.</speaker>
<line>Prithee forgive me, madam; come, thou shalt!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WIFE.</speaker>
<line>I'faith, &#8216;twas strangely done, sir.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VOT.</speaker>
<line>I confess it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WIFE.</speaker>
<line>Is that enough to help it, sir? 'Tis easy to draw a lady&#8217;s honour in suspicion,</line>
<line>But not so soon recovered and confirmed</line>
<line>To the first faith again from whence you brought it. Your wit was fetched out about other business, or such forgetfulness had never seized you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VOT.</speaker>
<line>'Twas but an overflowing, a spring tide</line>
<line>In my affection, raised by too much love;</line>
<line>And that&#8217;s the worst words you can give it, madam.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WIFE.</speaker>
<line>Jealous of me!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VOT.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Life, you'd a' sworn yourself, madam,</line>
<line>Had you been in my body, and changed cases, To see a fellow with a guilty pace</line>
<line>Glide through the room, his face three-quarters nighted,</line>
<line>As if a deed of darkness had hung on him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WIFE.</speaker>
<line>I tell you twice, &#8216;twas my bold woman&#8217;s friend. He&#8217;ll take her impudence!</line>

<speech>
<speaker>VOT.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Why, I have done, madam.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WIFE.</speaker>
<line>Y'ave done too late, sir. Who shall do the rest now?</line>
<line>Confessed me yielding! Was thy way too free?</line>
<line>Why, didst thou long to be restrained? Pray, speak, sir!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VOT.</speaker>
<line>A man cannot cozen you of the sin of weakness, Or borrow it of a woman for one hour, But how he&#8217;s wondered at. Where, search your lives, we shall ne&#8217;er find it from you; we can suffer you</line>
<line>To play away our days in idleness, And hide your imperfections with our loves, Or the most part of you would appear strange creatures; And now &#8216;tis but our chance to make an offer,</line>
<line>And snatch at folly, running, yet to see</line>
<line>How earnest y&#8217;are against us, as if we had robbed you Or the best gift your natural mother left you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WIFE.</speaker>
<line>'Tis worth a kiss, i&#8217;faith, and thou shalt ha&#8216;t,</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VOT.</speaker>
<line offset="5">I&#8217;ll say so too,</line>
<line>To give you encouragement and advance your virtues 'Tis not good always to keep down a woman.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WIFE.</speaker>
<line>Well, sir, since y'ave begun to make my lord A doubtful man of me, keep on that course, And ply his faith still with that poor belief That I&#8217;m inclining unto wantonness. Take heed you pass no further now.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VOT.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Why, dost think</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll be twice mad together in one moon? That were too much for any freeman&#8217;s son After his father&#8217;s funeral.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WIFE.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Well, then thus, sir,</line>
<line>Upholding still the same, as being emboldened</line>
<line>By some loose glance of mine, you shall attempt</line>
<line>(After y'ave placed my lord in some near closet) To thrust yourself into my chamber rudely, As if the game went forward to your thinking, Then leave the rest to me. I&#8217;ll so reward thee</line>
<line>With bitterness of wordsâ€”but prithee pardon &#8216;emâ€”</line>
<line>My lord shall swear me into honesty</line>
<line>Enough to serve his mind all his life after.</line>
<line>Nay, for a need, I&#8217;ll draw some rapier forth,</line>
<line>That shall come near my hand as &#8216;twere by chance,</line>
<line>And set a lively face upon my rage,</line>
<line>But fear thou nothing. I too dearly love thee</line>
<line>To let harm touch thee.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>WIFE.</speaker>
<line>How come you by such impudence alate, minion?</line>
<line>Y'are not content to entertain your playfellow</line>
<line>In your own chamber closely, which I think</line>
<line>Is large allowance for a lady&#8217;s woman.</line>
<line>There&#8217;s many a good knight&#8217;s daughter is in service</line>
<line>And cannot get such favor of her mistress</line>
<line>But what she has by stealth; she and the chambermaid</line>

<line>O, the wrongs</line>
<line>That ladies do their honours when they make Their slaves familiar with their weaknesses! They're ever thus rewarded for that deed; They stand in fear e&#8217;en of the groom they feed. I must be forced to speak my woman fair now, And be first friends with her. Nay, all too little. She may undo me at her pleasure else; She knows the way so well, myself not better, My wanton folly made a key for her To all the private treasure of my heart; She may do what she list.</line>

<speaker>WIFE.</speaker>
<line>One thing I had forgot; I prithee, wench,</line>
<line>Steal to Votarius closely, and remember him To wear some privy armour then about him, That I may feign a fury without fear.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEON.</speaker>
<line>Armour! When, madam?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WIFE.</speaker>
<line offset="5">See now, I chid thee</line>
<line>When I least thought upon thee: thou'rt my best hand.</line>
<line>I cannot be without thee. Thus then, sirrah:</line>
<line>To bear away suspicion from the thoughts</line>
<line>Of ruder-list'ning servants about house,</line>
<line>I have advised Votarius at fit time</line>
<line>Boldly to force his way into my chamber,</line>
<line>The admittance being denied him, and the passage</line>
<line>Kept strict by thee, my necessary woman.</line>
<line>(La! There I should ha&#8217; missed thy help again!)</line>
<line>At which attempt I&#8217;ll take occasion</line>
<line>To dissemble such an anger that the world</line>
<line>Shall ever after swear us to their thoughts</line>
<line>As clear and free from any fleshly knowledge, As nearest kindred are, or ought to be, Or what can more express it, if that failed.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEON.</speaker>
<line>You know I&#8217;m always at your service, madam, But why some privy armour?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WIFE.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Marry, sweetheart,</line>
<line>The best is yet forgotten; thou shalt hang A weapon in some corner of the chamber, Yonder, or thereâ€”</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEON.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Or anywhere. Why, i&#8217;faith, madam,</line>
<line>Do you think I&#8217;m to learn how to hang a weapon? As much as I&#8217;m uncapable of what follows,</line>
<line>I've all your mind without books. Think it done, madam.</line>

<line>I made her glad to seek my friendship first.</line>

<line>By my faith, that showed well. If you come off</line>
<line>So brave a conqueress, to&#8217;t again and spare not, I know not which way you should get more honour.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LEON.</speaker>
<line>She trusts me now to cast a mist, forsooth, Before the servants&#8217; eyes. I must remember</line>
<line>Votarius to come once with privy armour</line>
<line>Into her chamber, when with feigned fury</line>
<line>And rapier drawn, which I must lay a purpose</line>
<line>Ready for her dissemblance, she will seem</line>
<line>T'act wonders for her juggling honesty.</line>
</speech>

<speech>

<line>I wish no riper vengeance! Canst conceive me?</line>
<line>Votarius is my enemy.</line>

<line offset="5">That&#8217;s stale news, sir.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BEL.</speaker>
<line>Mark what I say to thee; forget of purpose That privy armour; do not bless his soul With so much warning, nor his hated body</line>
<line>With such sure safety. Here express thy love:</line>
<line>Lay some empoisoned weapon next her hand,</line>
<line>That in that play he may be lost forever.</line>
<line>I&#8216;d have him kept no longer; away with him!</line>
<line>One touch will set him flying! Let him go!</line>

Thou art mine now, spite of destruction And Govianus, and I will possess thee. I once read of a Herod, whose affection Pursued a virgin&#8217;s love as I did thine, Who, for the hate she owed him, killed herself, As thou too rashly didst, without all pity. Yet he preserved her body dead in honey And kept her long after her funeral. But I&#8217;ll unlock the treasure-house of art With keys of gold and bestow all on thee. Here, slaves, receive her humbly from our arms. Upon your knees, you villains! All&#8217;s too little If you should sweep the pavement with your lips.</line>

<line>To make up thanks for you, my honoured lords!</line>
<line>I&#8217;m like a man plucked up from many waters, That never looked for help, and am here placed Upon this cheerful mountain, where prosperity</line>
<line>Shoots forth her richest beam.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MEMP.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Long-injured lord,</line>
<line>The tyranny of his actions grew so weighty,</line>
<line>His life so viciousâ€”</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HELV.</speaker>
<line offset="5">To which this is witness-</line>
<line>Monster in sin!â€”this, the disquieted body Of my too resolute child in honour&#8217;s war.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MEMP.</speaker>
<line>â€”That he became as hateful to our mindsâ€”</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HELV.</speaker>
<line>As death&#8217;s unwelcome to a house of riches,</line>
<line>Or what can more express it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GOV.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Well, he&#8217;s gone;</line>
<line>And all the kingdom&#8217;s evils perish with him! And since the body of that virtuous lady Is taken from her rest, in memory</line>
<line>Of her admired mistress, &#8216;tis our will</line>
<line>It receive honour dead, as it took part</line>
<line>With us in all afflictions when it lived.</line>
<line>Here place her in this throne, crown her our queen,</line>
<line>The first and last that ever we make ours,</line>
<line>Her constancy strikes so much firmness in us.</line>
<line>That honour done, let her be solemnly borne Unto the house of peace from whence she came, As Queen of Silence.</line>
<line>The Spirit enters again and stays to go out with the body, as if it were attending it</line>
<line>O welcome, blessed spirit! Thou need&#8217;st not mistrust me; I have a care</line>
<line>As jealous as thine own. We'll see it done,</line>
<line>And not believe report; our zeal is such</line>
<line>We cannot reverence chastity too much.</line>
<line>Lead on! I would those ladies that fill honour&#8217;s rooms</line>
<line>Might all be borne so honest to their tombs.</line>
<line>Recorders or other solemn music plays them out.</line>
