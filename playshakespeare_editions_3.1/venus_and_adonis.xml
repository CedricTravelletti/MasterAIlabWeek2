<LINE>Right Honourable, I know not how I shall offend in dedicating my vnpolisht lines to your Lordship, nor how the worlde will censure mee for choosing so strong a proppe to support so weake a burden, onelye if your Honour seeme but pleased, I account my selfe highly praised, and vowe to take aduantage of all idle houres, till I haue honoured you with some grauer labour. But if the first heire of my inuention proue deformed, I shall be sorie it had so noble a god-father: and neuer after eare so barren a land, for feare it yeeld me still so bad a haruest, I leaue it to your Honourable suruey, and your Honor to your hearts content, which I wish may alwaies answere your owne wish, and the worlds hopefull expectation.</LINE>
<LINE>Your Honors in all dutie,</LINE>

<POEMBODY>
<STANZA>
<LINE>Even as the sun with purple-color&#8217;d face</LINE>
<LINE>Had ta&#8217;en his last leave of the weeping morn,</LINE>
<LINE>Rose-cheek&#8217;d Adonis hied him to the chase;</LINE>
<LINE>Hunting he lov&#8217;d, but love he laugh&#8217;d to scorn.</LINE>
<COUPLET>Sick-thoughted Venus makes amain unto him,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>And like a bold-fac&#8217;d suitor gins to woo him.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>&#8220;Thrice fairer than myself,&#8221; thus she began,</LINE>
<LINE>&#8220;The field&#8217;s chief flower, sweet above compare,</LINE>
<LINE>Stain to all nymphs, more lovely than a man,</LINE>
<LINE>More white and red than doves or roses are,</LINE>
<COUPLET>Nature, that made thee with herself at strife,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Saith that the world hath ending with thy life.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Vouchsafe, thou wonder, to alight thy steed,</LINE>
<LINE>And rein his proud head to the saddle-bow;</LINE>
<LINE>If thou wilt deign this favor, for thy meed</LINE>
<LINE>A thousand honey secrets shalt thou know.</LINE>
<COUPLET>Here come and sit, where never serpent hisses,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>And being set, I&#8217;ll smother thee with kisses;</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>And yet not cloy thy lips with loath&#8217;d saciety,</LINE>
<LINE>But rather famish them amid their plenty,</LINE>
<LINE>Making them red, and pale, with fresh variety&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Ten kisses short as one, one long as twenty.</LINE>
<COUPLET>A summer&#8217;s day will seem an hour but short,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Being wasted in such time-beguiling sport.&#8221;</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>With this she seizeth on his sweating palm,</LINE>
<LINE>The president of pith and livelihood,</LINE>
<LINE>And trembling in her passion, calls it balm,</LINE>
<LINE>Earth&#8217;s sovereign salve, to do a goddess good.</LINE>
<COUPLET>Being so enrag&#8217;d, desire doth lend her force</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Courageously to pluck him from his horse.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Over one arm the lusty courser&#8217;s rein,</LINE>
<LINE>Under her other was the tender boy,</LINE>
<LINE>Who blush&#8217;d, and pouted in a dull disdain,</LINE>
<LINE>With leaden appetite, unapt to toy;</LINE>
<COUPLET>She red and hot as coals of glowing fire,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>He red for shame, but frosty in desire.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>The studded bridle on a ragged bough</LINE>
<LINE>Nimbly she fastens (O how quick is love!);</LINE>
<LINE>The steed is stalled up, and even now</LINE>
<LINE>To tie the rider she begins to prove.</LINE>
<COUPLET>Backward she push&#8217;d him, as she would be thrust,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>And govern&#8217;d him in strength, though not in lust.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>So soon was she along as he was down,</LINE>
<LINE>Each leaning on their elbows and their hips.</LINE>
<LINE>Now doth she stroke his cheek, now doth he frown,</LINE>
<LINE>And gins to chide, but soon she stops his lips,</LINE>
<COUPLET>And kissing speaks, with lustful language broken,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>&#8220;If thou wilt chide, thy lips shall never open.&#8221;</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>He burns with bashful shame, she with her tears</LINE>
<LINE>Doth quench the maiden burning of his cheeks;</LINE>
<LINE>Then with her windy sighs and golden hairs</LINE>
<LINE>To fan and blow them dry again she seeks.</LINE>
<COUPLET>He saith she is immodest, blames her miss;</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>What follows more, she murders with a kiss.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Even as an empty eagle, sharp by fast,</LINE>
<LINE>Tires with her beak on feathers, flesh, and bone,</LINE>
<LINE>Shaking her wings, devouring all in haste,</LINE>
<LINE>Till either gorge be stuff&#8217;d, or prey be gone;</LINE>
<COUPLET>Even so she kiss&#8217;d his brow, his cheek, his chin,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>And where she ends, she doth anew begin.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Forc&#8217;d to content, but never to obey,</LINE>
<LINE>Panting he lies, and breatheth in her face.</LINE>
<LINE>She feedeth on the steam, as on a prey,</LINE>
<LINE>And calls it heavenly moisture, air of grace,</LINE>
<COUPLET>Wishing her cheeks were gardens full of flowers,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>So they were dew&#8217;d with such distilling showers.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Look how a bird lies tangled in a net,</LINE>
<LINE>So fast&#8217;ned in her arms Adonis lies;</LINE>
<LINE>Pure shame and aw&#8217;d resistance made him fret,</LINE>
<LINE>Which bred more beauty in his angry eyes.</LINE>
<COUPLET>Rain added to a river that is rank</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Perforce will force it overflow the bank.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Still she entreats, and prettily entreats,</LINE>
<LINE>For to a pretty ear she tunes her tale.</LINE>
<LINE>Still is he sullen, still he low&#8217;rs and frets,</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Twixt crimson shame and anger ashy-pale.</LINE>
<COUPLET>Being red, she loves him best, and being white,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Her best is better&#8217;d with a more delight.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Look how he can, she cannot choose but love,</LINE>
<LINE>And by her fair immortal hand she swears</LINE>
<LINE>From his soft bosom never to remove</LINE>
<LINE>Till he take truce with her contending tears,</LINE>
<COUPLET>Which long have rain&#8217;d, making her cheeks all wet,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>And one sweet kiss shall pay this comptless debt.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Upon this promise did he raise his chin,</LINE>
<LINE>Like a dive-dapper peering through a wave,</LINE>
<LINE>Who being look&#8217;d on, ducks as quickly in;</LINE>
<LINE>So offers he to give what she did crave,</LINE>
<COUPLET>But when her lips were ready for his pay,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>He winks, and turns his lips another way.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Never did passenger in summer&#8217;s heat</LINE>
<LINE>More thirst for drink than she for this good turn.</LINE>
<LINE>Her help she sees, but help she cannot get,</LINE>
<LINE>She bathes in water, yet her fire must burn.</LINE>
<COUPLET>&#8220;O, pity,&#8221; gan she cry, &#8220;flint-hearted boy,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>&#8217;Tis but a kiss I beg, why art thou coy?</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>I have been wooed, as I entreat thee now,</LINE>
<LINE>Even by the stern and direful god of war,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose sinowy neck in battle ne&#8217;er did bow,</LINE>
<LINE>Who conquers where he comes in every jar,</LINE>
<COUPLET>Yet hath he been my captive, and my slave,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>And begg&#8217;d for that which thou unask&#8217;d shalt have.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Over my altars hath he hung his lance,</LINE>
<LINE>His batt&#8217;red shield, his uncontrolled crest,</LINE>
<LINE>And for my sake hath learn&#8217;d to sport and dance,</LINE>
<LINE>To toy, to wanton, dally, smile, and jest,</LINE>
<COUPLET>Scorning his churlish drum, and ensign red,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Making my arms his field, his tent my bed.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Thus he that overrul&#8217;d I overswayed,</LINE>
<LINE>Leading him prisoner in a red rose chain;</LINE>
<LINE>Strong-temper&#8217;d steel his stronger strength obeyed,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet was he servile to my coy disdain.</LINE>
<COUPLET>O, be not proud, nor brag not of thy might,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>For mast&#8217;ring her that foil&#8217;d the god of fight.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Touch but my lips with those fair lips of thine&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Though mine be not so fair, yet are they red&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>The kiss shall be thine own as well as mine.</LINE>
<LINE>What seest thou in the ground? hold up thy head,</LINE>
<COUPLET>Look in mine eyeballs, there thy beauty lies;</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Then why not lips on lips, since eyes in eyes?</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Art thou asham&#8217;d to kiss? then wink again,</LINE>
<LINE>And I will wink, so shall the day seem night.</LINE>
<LINE>Love keeps his revels where there are but twain;</LINE>
<LINE>Be bold to play, our sport is not in sight;</LINE>
<COUPLET>These blue-vein&#8217;d violets whereon we lean</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Never can blab, nor know not what we mean.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>The tender spring upon thy tempting lip</LINE>
<LINE>Shows thee unripe; yet mayst thou well be tasted.</LINE>
<LINE>Make use of time, let not advantage slip,</LINE>
<LINE>Beauty within itself should not be wasted.</LINE>
<COUPLET>Fair flowers that are not gath&#8217;red in their prime</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Rot, and consume themselves in little time.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Were I hard-favor&#8217;d, foul, or wrinkled old,</LINE>
<LINE>Ill-nurtur&#8217;d, crooked, churlish, harsh in voice,</LINE>
<LINE>O&#8217;erworn, despised, rheumatic, and cold,</LINE>
<LINE>Thick-sighted, barren, lean, and lacking juice,</LINE>
<COUPLET>Then mightst thou pause, for then I were not for thee,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>But having no defects, why dost abhor me?</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Thou canst not see one wrinkle in my brow,</LINE>
<LINE>Mine eyes are grey, and bright, and quick in turning;</LINE>
<LINE>My beauty as the spring doth yearly grow,</LINE>
<LINE>My flesh is soft and plump, my marrow burning,</LINE>
<COUPLET>My smooth moist hand, were it with thy hand felt,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Would in thy palm dissolve, or seem to melt.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Bid me discourse, I will enchant thine ear,</LINE>
<LINE>Or like a fairy, trip upon the green,</LINE>
<LINE>Or like a nymph, with long dishevelled hair,</LINE>
<LINE>Dance on the sands, and yet no footing seen.</LINE>
<COUPLET>Love is a spirit all compact of fire,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Not gross to sink, but light, and will aspire.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Witness this primrose bank whereon I lie,</LINE>
<LINE>These forceless flowers like sturdy trees support me;</LINE>
<LINE>Two strengthless doves will draw me through the sky,</LINE>
<LINE>From morn till night, even where I list to sport me.</LINE>
<COUPLET>Is love so light, sweet boy, and may it be</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>That thou should think it heavy unto thee?</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Is thine own heart to thine own face affected?</LINE>
<LINE>Can thy right hand seize love upon thy left?</LINE>
<LINE>Then woo thyself, be of thyself rejected;</LINE>
<LINE>Steal thine own freedom, and complain on theft.</LINE>
<COUPLET>Narcissus so himself himself forsook,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>And died to kiss his shadow in the brook.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Torches are made to light, jewels to wear,</LINE>
<LINE>Dainties to taste, fresh beauty for the use,</LINE>
<LINE>Herbs for their smell, and sappy plants to bear:</LINE>
<LINE>Things growing to themselves are growth&#8217;s abuse.</LINE>
<COUPLET>Seeds spring from seeds, and beauty breedeth beauty;</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Thou wast begot, to get it is thy duty.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Upon the earth&#8217;s increase why shouldst thou feed,</LINE>
<LINE>Unless the earth with thy increase be fed?</LINE>
<LINE>By law of nature thou art bound to breed,</LINE>
<LINE>That thine may live, when thou thyself art dead;</LINE>
<COUPLET>And so in spite of death thou dost survive,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>In that thy likeness still is left alive.&#8221;</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>By this the love-sick queen began to sweat,</LINE>
<LINE>For where they lay the shadow had forsook them,</LINE>
<LINE>And Titan, tired in the midday heat,</LINE>
<LINE>With burning eye did hotly overlook them,</LINE>
<COUPLET>Wishing Adonis had his team to guide,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>So he were like him, and by Venus&#8217; side.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>And now Adonis, with a lazy sprite,</LINE>
<LINE>And with a heavy, dark, disliking eye,</LINE>
<LINE>His low&#8217;ring brows o&#8217;erwhelming his fair sight,</LINE>
<LINE>Like misty vapors when they blot the sky,</LINE>
<COUPLET>Souring his cheeks, cries, &#8220;Fie, no more of love!</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>The sun doth burn my face, I must remove.&#8221;</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>&#8220;Ay me,&#8221; quoth Venus, &#8220;young, and so unkind,</LINE>
<LINE>What bare excuses mak&#8217;st thou to be gone!</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll sigh celestial breath, whose gentle wind</LINE>
<LINE>Shall cool the heat of this descending sun;</LINE>
<COUPLET>I&#8217;ll make a shadow for thee of my hairs;</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>If they burn too, I&#8217;ll quench them with my tears.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>The sun that shines from heaven shines but warm,</LINE>
<LINE>And lo I lie between that sun and thee;</LINE>
<LINE>The heat I have from thence doth little harm,</LINE>
<LINE>Thine eye darts forth the fire that burneth me,</LINE>
<COUPLET>And were I not immortal, life were done,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Between this heavenly and earthly sun.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Art thou obdurate, flinty, hard as steel?</LINE>
<LINE>Nay, more than flint, for stone at rain relenteth.</LINE>
<LINE>Art thou a woman&#8217;s son and canst not feel</LINE>
<LINE>What &#8217;tis to love, how want of love tormenteth?</LINE>
<COUPLET>O, had thy mother borne so hard a mind,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>She had not brought forth thee, but died unkind.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>What am I that thou shouldst contemn me this?</LINE>
<LINE>Or what great danger dwells upon my suit?</LINE>
<LINE>What were thy lips the worse for one poor kiss?</LINE>
<LINE>Speak, fair, but speak fair words, or else be mute.</LINE>
<COUPLET>Give me one kiss, I&#8217;ll give it thee again,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>And one for int&#8217;rest, if thou wilt have twain.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Fie, liveless picture, cold and senseless stone,</LINE>
<LINE>Well-painted idol, image dull and dead,</LINE>
<LINE>Statuë contenting but the eye alone,</LINE>
<LINE>Thing like a man, but of no woman bred!</LINE>
<COUPLET>Thou art no man, though of a man&#8217;s complexion,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>For men will kiss even by their own direction.&#8221;</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>This said, impatience chokes her pleading tongue,</LINE>
<LINE>And swelling passion doth provoke a pause.</LINE>
<LINE>Red cheeks and fiery eyes blaze forth her wrong;</LINE>
<LINE>Being judge in love, she cannot right her cause.</LINE>
<COUPLET>And now she weeps, and now she fain would speak,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>And now her sobs do her intendments break.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Sometime she shakes her head, and then his hand,</LINE>
<LINE>Now gazeth she on him, now on the ground;</LINE>
<LINE>Sometime her arms infold him like a band:</LINE>
<LINE>She would, he will not in her arms be bound;</LINE>
<COUPLET>And when from thence he struggles to be gone,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>She locks her lily fingers one in one.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>&#8220;Fondling,&#8221; she saith, &#8220;since I have hemm&#8217;d thee here</LINE>
<LINE>Within the circuit of this ivory pale,</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll be a park, and thou shalt be my deer:</LINE>
<LINE>Feed where thou wilt, on mountain, or in dale;</LINE>
<COUPLET>Graze on my lips, and if those hills be dry,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Stray lower, where the pleasant fountains lie.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Within this limit is relief enough,</LINE>
<LINE>Sweet bottom grass and high delightful plain,</LINE>
<LINE>Round rising hillocks, brakes obscure and rough,</LINE>
<LINE>To shelter thee from tempest and from rain;</LINE>
<COUPLET>Then be my deer, since I am such a park,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>No dog shall rouse thee, though a thousand bark.&#8221;</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>At this Adonis smiles as in disdain,</LINE>
<LINE>That in each cheek appears a pretty dimple;</LINE>
<LINE>Love made those hollows, if himself were slain,</LINE>
<LINE>He might be buried in a tomb so simple,</LINE>
<COUPLET>Foreknowing well, if there he came to lie,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Why, there Love liv&#8217;d, and there he could not die.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>These lovely caves, these round enchanting pits,</LINE>
<LINE>Open&#8217;d their mouths to swallow Venus&#8217; liking.</LINE>
<LINE>Being mad before, how doth she now for wits?</LINE>
<LINE>Struck dead at first, what needs a second striking?</LINE>
<COUPLET>Poor queen of love, in thine own law forlorn,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>To love a cheek that smiles at thee in scorn!</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Now which way shall she turn? what shall she say?</LINE>
<LINE>Her words are done, her woes the more increasing;</LINE>
<LINE>The time is spent, her object will away,</LINE>
<LINE>And from her twining arms doth urge releasing.</LINE>
<COUPLET>&#8220;Pity,&#8221; she cries, &#8220;some favor, some remorse!&#8221;</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Away he springs, and hasteth to his horse.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>But lo from forth a copse that neighbors by,</LINE>
<LINE>A breeding jennet, lusty, young, and proud,</LINE>
<LINE>Adonis&#8217; trampling courser doth espy;</LINE>
<LINE>And forth she rushes, snorts, and neighs aloud.</LINE>
<COUPLET>The strong-neck&#8217;d steed, being tied unto a tree,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Breaketh his rein, and to her straight goes he.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Imperiously he leaps, he neighs, he bounds,</LINE>
<LINE>And now his woven girths he breaks asunder;</LINE>
<LINE>The bearing earth with his hard hoof he wounds,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose hollow womb resounds like heaven&#8217;s thunder;</LINE>
<COUPLET>The iron bit he crusheth &#8217;tween his teeth,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Controlling what he was controlled with.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>His ears up-prick&#8217;d, his braided hanging mane</LINE>
<LINE>Upon his compass&#8217;d crest now stand on end,</LINE>
<LINE>His nostrils drink the air, and forth again</LINE>
<LINE>As from a furnace, vapors doth he send;</LINE>
<COUPLET>His eye, which scornfully glisters like fire,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Shows his hot courage and his high desire.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Sometime he trots, as if he told the steps,</LINE>
<LINE>With gentle majesty and modest pride;</LINE>
<LINE>Anon he rears upright, curvets, and leaps,</LINE>
<LINE>As who should say, &#8220;Lo thus my strength is tried;</LINE>
<COUPLET>And this I do to captivate the eye</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Of the fair breeder that is standing by.&#8221;</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>What recketh he his rider&#8217;s angry stir,</LINE>
<LINE>His flattering &#8220;Holla,&#8221; or his &#8220;Stand, I say&#8221;?</LINE>
<LINE>What cares he now for curb, or pricking spur,</LINE>
<LINE>For rich caparisons, or trappings gay?</LINE>
<COUPLET>He sees his love, and nothing else he sees,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>For nothing else with his proud sight agrees.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Look when a painter would surpass the life</LINE>
<LINE>In limning out a well-proportioned steed,</LINE>
<LINE>His art with nature&#8217;s workmanship at strife,</LINE>
<LINE>As if the dead the living should exceed;</LINE>
<COUPLET>So did this horse excel a common one,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>In shape, in courage, color, pace, and bone.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Round-hoof&#8217;d, short-jointed, fetlocks shag and long,</LINE>
<LINE>Broad breast, full eye, small head, and nostril wide,</LINE>
<LINE>High crest, short ears, straight legs and passing strong,</LINE>
<LINE>Thin mane, thick tail, broad buttock, tender hide:</LINE>
<COUPLET>Look what a horse should have he did not lack,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Save a proud rider on so proud a back.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Sometime he scuds far off, and there he stares,</LINE>
<LINE>Anon he starts at stirring of a feather;</LINE>
<LINE>To bid the wind a base he now prepares,</LINE>
<LINE>And whe&#8217;er he run, or fly, they know not whether;</LINE>
<COUPLET>For through his mane and tail the high wind sings,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Fanning the hairs, who wave like feath&#8217;red wings.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>He looks upon his love, and neighs unto her,</LINE>
<LINE>She answers him, as if she knew his mind;</LINE>
<LINE>Being proud as females are, to see him woo her,</LINE>
<LINE>She puts on outward strangeness, seems unkind,</LINE>
<COUPLET>Spurns at his love, and scorns the heat he feels,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Beating his kind embracements with her heels.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Then like a melancholy malcontent,</LINE>
<LINE>He vails his tail that like a falling plume</LINE>
<LINE>Cool shadow to his melting buttock lent;</LINE>
<LINE>He stamps, and bites the poor flies in his fume.</LINE>
<COUPLET>His love, perceiving how he was enrag&#8217;d,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Grew kinder, and his fury was assuag&#8217;d.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>His testy master goeth about to take him,</LINE>
<LINE>When lo the unback&#8217;d breeder, full of fear,</LINE>
<LINE>Jealous of catching, swiftly doth forsake him,</LINE>
<LINE>With her the horse, and left Adonis there.</LINE>
<COUPLET>As they were mad unto the wood they hie them,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Outstripping crows that strive to overfly them.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>All swoll&#8217;n with chafing, down Adonis sits,</LINE>
<LINE>Banning his boist&#8217;rous and unruly beast;</LINE>
<LINE>And now the happy season once more fits</LINE>
<LINE>That love-sick Love by pleading may be blest;</LINE>
<COUPLET>For lovers say, the heart hath treble wrong</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>When it is barr&#8217;d the aidance of the tongue.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>An oven that is stopp&#8217;d, or river stay&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Burneth more hotly, swelleth with more rage;</LINE>
<LINE>So of concealed sorrow may be said,</LINE>
<LINE>Free vent of words love&#8217;s fire doth assuage,</LINE>
<COUPLET>But when the heart&#8217;s attorney once is mute,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>The client breaks, as desperate in his suit.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>He sees her coming, and begins to glow,</LINE>
<LINE>Even as a dying coal revives with wind,</LINE>
<LINE>And with his bonnet hides his angry brow,</LINE>
<LINE>Looks on the dull earth with disturbed mind,</LINE>
<COUPLET>Taking no notice that she is so nigh,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>For all askance he holds her in his eye.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>O what a sight it was wistly to view,</LINE>
<LINE>How she came stealing to the wayward boy,</LINE>
<LINE>To note the fighting conflict of her hue,</LINE>
<LINE>How white and red each other did destroy!</LINE>
<COUPLET>But now her cheek was pale, and by and by</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>It flash&#8217;d forth fire, as lightning from the sky.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Now was she just before him as he sat,</LINE>
<LINE>And like a lowly lover down she kneels;</LINE>
<LINE>With one fair hand she heaveth up his hat,</LINE>
<LINE>Her other tender hand his fair cheek feels:</LINE>
<COUPLET>His tend&#8217;rer cheek receives her soft hand&#8217;s print,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>As apt as new-fall&#8217;n snow takes any dint.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>O what a war of looks was then between them!</LINE>
<LINE>Her eyes petitioners to his eyes suing,</LINE>
<LINE>His eyes saw her eyes as they had not seen them,</LINE>
<LINE>Her eyes wooed still, his eyes disdain&#8217;d the wooing;</LINE>
<COUPLET>And all this dumb play had his acts made plain</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>With tears which chorus-like her eyes did rain.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Full gently now she takes him by the hand,</LINE>
<LINE>A lily prison&#8217;d in a jail of snow,</LINE>
<LINE>Or ivory in an alablaster band,</LINE>
<LINE>So white a friend engirts so white a foe:</LINE>
<COUPLET>This beauteous combat, willful and unwilling,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Showed like two silver doves that sit a-billing.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Once more the engine of her thoughts began:</LINE>
<LINE>&#8220;O fairest mover on this mortal round,</LINE>
<LINE>Would thou wert as I am, and I a man,</LINE>
<LINE>My heart all whole as thine, thy heart my wound!</LINE>
<COUPLET>For one sweet look thy help I would assure thee,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Though nothing but my body&#8217;s bane would cure thee.&#8221;</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>&#8220;Give me my hand,&#8221; saith he, &#8220;why dost thou feel it?&#8221;</LINE>
<LINE>&#8220;Give me my heart,&#8221; saith she, &#8220;and thou shalt have it.</LINE>
<LINE>O, give it me, lest thy hard heart do steel it,</LINE>
<LINE>And being steel&#8217;d, soft sighs can never grave it.</LINE>
<COUPLET>Then love&#8217;s deep groans I never shall regard,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Because Adonis&#8217; heart hath made mine hard.&#8221;</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>&#8220;For shame,&#8221; he cries, &#8220;let go, and let me go,</LINE>
<LINE>My day&#8217;s delight is past, my horse is gone,</LINE>
<LINE>And &#8217;tis your fault I am bereft him so.</LINE>
<LINE>I pray you hence, and leave me here alone,</LINE>
<COUPLET>For all my mind, my thought, my busy care,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Is how to get my palfrey from the mare.&#8221;</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Thus she replies: &#8220;Thy palfrey, as he should,</LINE>
<LINE>Welcomes the warm approach of sweet desire;</LINE>
<LINE>Affection is a coal that must be cool&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Else suffer&#8217;d it will set the heart on fire.</LINE>
<COUPLET>The sea hath bounds, but deep desire hath none,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Therefore no marvel though thy horse be gone.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>How like a jade he stood, tied to the tree,</LINE>
<LINE>Servilely master&#8217;d with a leathern rein!</LINE>
<LINE>But when he saw his love, his youth&#8217;s fair fee,</LINE>
<LINE>He held such petty bondage in disdain,</LINE>
<COUPLET>Throwing the base thong from his bending crest,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Enfranchising his mouth, his back, his breast.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Who sees his true-love in her naked bed,</LINE>
<LINE>Teaching the sheets a whiter hue than white,</LINE>
<LINE>But when his glutton eye so full hath fed,</LINE>
<LINE>His other agents aim at like delight?</LINE>
<COUPLET>Who is so faint that dares not be so bold</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>To touch the fire, the weather being cold?</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Let me excuse thy courser, gentle boy,</LINE>
<LINE>And learn of him, I heartily beseech thee,</LINE>
<LINE>To take advantage on presented joy;</LINE>
<LINE>Though I were dumb, yet his proceedings teach thee.</LINE>
<COUPLET>O, learn to love, the lesson is but plain,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>And once made perfect, never lost again.&#8221;</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>&#8220;I know not love,&#8221; quoth he, &#8220;nor will not know it,</LINE>
<LINE>Unless it be a boar, and then I chase it;</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis much to borrow, and I will not owe it;</LINE>
<LINE>My love to love is love but to disgrace it,</LINE>
<COUPLET>For I have heard it is a life in death,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>That laughs and weeps, and all but with a breath.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Who wears a garment shapeless and unfinish&#8217;d?</LINE>
<LINE>Who plucks the bud before one leaf put forth?</LINE>
<LINE>If springing things be any jot diminish&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>They wither in their prime, prove nothing worth;</LINE>
<COUPLET>The colt that&#8217;s back&#8217;d and burden&#8217;d being young,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Loseth his pride, and never waxeth strong.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>You hurt my hand with wringing, let us part,</LINE>
<LINE>And leave this idle theme, this bootless chat;</LINE>
<LINE>Remove your siege from my unyielding heart,</LINE>
<LINE>To love&#8217;s alarms it will not ope the gate;</LINE>
<COUPLET>Dismiss your vows, your feigned tears, your flatt&#8217;ry,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>For where a heart is hard they make no batt&#8217;ry.&#8221;</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>&#8220;What, canst thou talk?&#8221; quoth she, &#8220;hast thou a tongue?</LINE>
<LINE>O would thou hadst not, or I had no hearing!</LINE>
<LINE>Thy mermaid&#8217;s voice hath done me double wrong;</LINE>
<LINE>I had my load before, now press&#8217;d with bearing:</LINE>
<COUPLET>Melodious discord, heavenly tune harsh sounding,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Ears&#8217; deep sweet music, and heart&#8217;s deep sore wounding.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Had I no eyes but ears, my ears would love</LINE>
<LINE>That inward beauty and invisible,</LINE>
<LINE>Or were I deaf, thy outward parts would move</LINE>
<LINE>Each part in me that were but sensible;</LINE>
<COUPLET>Though neither eyes nor ears to hear nor see,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Yet should I be in love by touching thee.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Say that the sense of feeling were bereft me,</LINE>
<LINE>And that I could not see, nor hear, nor touch,</LINE>
<LINE>And nothing but the very smell were left me,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet would my love to thee be still as much,</LINE>
<COUPLET>For from the stillitory of thy face excelling</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Comes breath perfum&#8217;d, that breedeth love by smelling.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>But O, what banquet wert thou to the taste,</LINE>
<LINE>Being nurse and feeder of the other four!</LINE>
<LINE>Would they not wish the feast might ever last,</LINE>
<LINE>And bid Suspicion double-lock the door,</LINE>
<COUPLET>Lest Jealousy, that sour unwelcome guest,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Should by his stealing in disturb the feast?&#8221;</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Once more the ruby-color&#8217;d portal open&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Which to his speech did honey passage yield,</LINE>
<LINE>Like a red morn, that ever yet betoken&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>Wrack to the seaman, tempest to the field,</LINE>
<COUPLET>Sorrow to shepherds, woe unto the birds,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Gusts and foul flaws to herdmen and to herds.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>This ill presage advisedly she marketh:</LINE>
<LINE>Even as the wind is hush&#8217;d before it raineth,</LINE>
<LINE>Or as the wolf doth grin before he barketh,</LINE>
<LINE>Or as the berry breaks before it staineth,</LINE>
<COUPLET>Or like the deadly bullet of a gun,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>His meaning struck her ere his words begun.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>And at his look she flatly falleth down,</LINE>
<LINE>For looks kill love, and love by looks reviveth:</LINE>
<LINE>A smile recures the wounding of a frown.</LINE>
<LINE>But blessed bankrout that by love so thriveth!</LINE>
<COUPLET>The silly boy, believing she is dead,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Claps her pale cheek, till clapping makes it red;</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>And all amaz&#8217;d, brake off his late intent,</LINE>
<LINE>For sharply he did think to reprehend her,</LINE>
<LINE>Which cunning Love did wittily prevent:</LINE>
<LINE>Fair fall the wit that can so well defend her!</LINE>
<COUPLET>For on the grass she lies as she were slain,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Till his breath breatheth life in her again.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>He wrings her nose, he strikes her on the cheeks,</LINE>
<LINE>He bends her fingers, holds her pulses hard,</LINE>
<LINE>He chafes her lips, a thousand ways he seeks</LINE>
<LINE>To mend the hurt that his unkindness marr&#8217;d,</LINE>
<COUPLET>He kisses her, and she by her good will</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Will never rise, so he will kiss her still.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>The night of sorrow now is turn&#8217;d to day:</LINE>
<LINE>Her two blue windows faintly she upheaveth,</LINE>
<LINE>Like the fair sun, when in his fresh array</LINE>
<LINE>He cheers the morn, and all the earth relieveth;</LINE>
<COUPLET>And as the bright sun glorifies the sky,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>So is her face illumin&#8217;d with her eye,</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Whose beams upon his hairless face are fix&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>As if from thence they borrowed all their shine.</LINE>
<LINE>Were never four such lamps together mix&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Had not his clouded with his brow&#8217;s repine;</LINE>
<COUPLET>But hers, which through the crystal tears gave light,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Shone like the moon in water seen by night.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>&#8220;O, where am I?&#8221; quoth she, &#8220;in earth or heaven,</LINE>
<LINE>Or in the ocean drench&#8217;d, or in the fire?</LINE>
<LINE>What hour is this? or morn or weary even?</LINE>
<LINE>Do I delight to die, or life desire?</LINE>
<COUPLET>But now I liv&#8217;d, and life was death&#8217;s annoy,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>But now I died, and death was lively joy.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>O, thou didst kill me, kill me once again.</LINE>
<LINE>Thy eyes&#8217; shrowd tutor, that hard heart of thine,</LINE>
<LINE>Hath taught them scornful tricks, and such disdain</LINE>
<LINE>That they have murd&#8217;red this poor heart of mine,</LINE>
<COUPLET>And these mine eyes, true leaders to their queen,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>But for thy piteous lips no more had seen.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Long may they kiss each other for this cure!</LINE>
<LINE>O, never let their crimson liveries wear!</LINE>
<LINE>And as they last, their verdour still endure,</LINE>
<LINE>To drive infection from the dangerous year!</LINE>
<COUPLET>That the star-gazers, having writ on death,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>May say, the plague is banish&#8217;d by thy breath.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Pure lips, sweet seals in my soft lips imprinted,</LINE>
<LINE>What bargains may I make, still to be sealing?</LINE>
<LINE>To sell myself I can be well contented,</LINE>
<LINE>So thou wilt buy, and pay, and use good dealing,</LINE>
<COUPLET>Which purchase if thou make, for fear of slips,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Set thy seal manual on my wax-red lips.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>A thousand kisses buys my heart from me,</LINE>
<LINE>And pay them at thy leisure, one by one.</LINE>
<LINE>What is ten hundred touches unto thee?</LINE>
<LINE>Are they not quickly told, and quickly gone?</LINE>
<COUPLET>Say for non-payment that the debt should double,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Is twenty hundred kisses such a trouble?&#8221;</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>&#8220;Fair queen,&#8221; quoth he, &#8220;if any love you owe me,</LINE>
<LINE>Measure my strangeness with my unripe years;</LINE>
<LINE>Before I know myself, seek not to know me,</LINE>
<LINE>No fisher but the ungrown fry forbears;</LINE>
<COUPLET>The mellow plum doth fall, the green sticks fast,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Or being early pluck&#8217;d, is sour to taste.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Look the world&#8217;s comforter with weary gait</LINE>
<LINE>His day&#8217;s hot task hath ended in the west;</LINE>
<LINE>The owl (night&#8217;s herald) shrieks, &#8217;tis very late;</LINE>
<LINE>The sheep are gone to fold, birds to their nest,</LINE>
<COUPLET>And coal-black clouds that shadow heaven&#8217;s light</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Do summon us to part, and bid good night.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Now let me say &#8216;Good night,&#8217; and so say you;</LINE>
<LINE>If you will say so, you shall have a kiss.&#8221;</LINE>
<LINE>&#8220;Good night,&#8221; quoth she, and ere he says &#8220;Adieu,&#8221;</LINE>
<LINE>The honey fee of parting tend&#8217;red is;</LINE>
<COUPLET>Her arms do lend his neck a sweet embrace;</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Incorporate then they seem, face grows to face;</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Till breathless he disjoin&#8217;d, and backward drew</LINE>
<LINE>The heavenly moisture, that sweet coral mouth,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose precious taste her thirsty lips well knew,</LINE>
<LINE>Whereon they surfeit, yet complain on drouth;</LINE>
<COUPLET>He with her plenty press&#8217;d, she faint with dearth,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Their lips together glued, fall to the earth.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Now quick desire hath caught the yielding prey,</LINE>
<LINE>And glutton-like she feeds, yet never filleth;</LINE>
<LINE>Her lips are conquerors, his lips obey,</LINE>
<LINE>Paying what ransom the insulter willeth;</LINE>
<COUPLET>Whose vultur thought doth pitch the price so high</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>That she will draw his lips&#8217; rich treasure dry.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>And having felt the sweetness of the spoil,</LINE>
<LINE>With blindfold fury she begins to forage;</LINE>
<LINE>Her face doth reek and smoke, her blood doth boil,</LINE>
<LINE>And careless lust stirs up a desperate courage,</LINE>
<COUPLET>Planting oblivion, beating reason back,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Forgetting shame&#8217;s pure blush and honor&#8217;s wrack.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Hot, faint, and weary, with her hard embracing,</LINE>
<LINE>Like a wild bird being tam&#8217;d with too much handling,</LINE>
<LINE>Or as the fleet-foot roe that&#8217;s tir&#8217;d with chasing,</LINE>
<LINE>Or like the froward infant still&#8217;d with dandling,</LINE>
<COUPLET>He now obeys, and now no more resisteth,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>While she takes all she can, not all she listeth.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>What wax so frozen but dissolves with temp&#8217;ring,</LINE>
<LINE>And yields at last to every light impression?</LINE>
<LINE>Things out of hope are compass&#8217;d oft with vent&#8217;ring,</LINE>
<LINE>Chiefly in love, whose leave exceeds commission;</LINE>
<COUPLET>Affection faints not like a pale-fac&#8217;d coward,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>But then woos best when most his choice is froward.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>When he did frown, O had she then gave over,</LINE>
<LINE>Such nectar from his lips she had not suck&#8217;d.</LINE>
<LINE>Foul words and frowns must not repel a lover;</LINE>
<LINE>What though the rose have prickles, yet &#8217;tis pluck&#8217;d!</LINE>
<COUPLET>Were beauty under twenty locks kept fast,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Yet love breaks through, and picks them all at last.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>For pity now she can no more detain him;</LINE>
<LINE>The poor fool prays her that he may depart.</LINE>
<LINE>She is resolv&#8217;d no longer to restrain him,</LINE>
<LINE>Bids him farewell, and look well to her heart,</LINE>
<COUPLET>The which, by Cupid&#8217;s bow she doth protest,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>He carries thence incaged in his breast.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>&#8220;Sweet boy,&#8221; she says, &#8220;this night I&#8217;ll waste in sorrow,</LINE>
<LINE>For my sick heart commands mine eyes to watch.</LINE>
<LINE>Tell me, Love&#8217;s master, shall we meet tomorrow?</LINE>
<LINE>Say, shall we, shall we? wilt thou make the match?&#8221;</LINE>
<COUPLET>He tells her no, tomorrow he intends</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>To hunt the boar with certain of his friends.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>&#8220;The boar!&#8221; quoth she, whereat a sudden pale,</LINE>
<LINE>Like lawn being spread upon the blushing rose,</LINE>
<LINE>Usurps her cheek; she trembles at his tale,</LINE>
<LINE>And on his neck her yoking arms she throws.</LINE>
<COUPLET>She sinketh down, still hanging by his neck,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>He on her belly falls, she on her back.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Now is she in the very lists of love,</LINE>
<LINE>Her champion mounted for the hot encounter;</LINE>
<LINE>All is imaginary she doth prove,</LINE>
<LINE>He will not manage her, although he mount her,</LINE>
<COUPLET>That worse than Tantalus&#8217; is her annoy,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>To clip Elysium and to lack her joy.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Even so poor birds, deceiv&#8217;d with painted grapes,</LINE>
<LINE>Do surfeit by the eye and pine the maw;</LINE>
<LINE>Even so she languisheth in her mishaps,</LINE>
<LINE>As those poor birds that helpless berries saw.</LINE>
<COUPLET>The warm effects which she in him finds missing</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>She seeks to kindle with continual kissing.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>But all in vain, good queen, it will not be;</LINE>
<LINE>She hath assay&#8217;d as much as may be prov&#8217;d.</LINE>
<LINE>Her pleading hath deserv&#8217;d a greater fee;</LINE>
<LINE>She&#8217;s Love, she loves, and yet she is not lov&#8217;d.</LINE>
<COUPLET>&#8220;Fie, fie,&#8221; he says, &#8220;you crush me, let me go,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>You have no reason to withhold me so.&#8221;</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>&#8220;Thou hadst been gone,&#8221; quoth she, &#8220;sweet boy, ere this,</LINE>
<LINE>But that thou toldst me thou wouldst hunt the boar.</LINE>
<LINE>O, be advis&#8217;d, thou know&#8217;st not what it is</LINE>
<LINE>With javeling&#8217;s point a churlish swine to gore,</LINE>
<COUPLET>Whose tushes never sheath&#8217;d he whetteth still,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Like to a mortal butcher bent to kill.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>On his bow-back he hath a battle set</LINE>
<LINE>Of bristly pikes that ever threat his foes,</LINE>
<LINE>His eyes like glow-worms shine when he doth fret,</LINE>
<LINE>His snout digs sepulchres where e&#8217;er he goes;</LINE>
<COUPLET>Being mov&#8217;d, he strikes, what e&#8217;er is in his way,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>And whom he strikes his crooked tushes slay.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>His brawny sides, with hairy bristles armed,</LINE>
<LINE>Are better proof than thy spear&#8217;s point can enter;</LINE>
<LINE>His short thick neck cannot be easily harmed;</LINE>
<LINE>Being ireful, on the lion he will venter.</LINE>
<COUPLET>The thorny brambles and embracing bushes,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>As fearful of him, part, through whom he rushes.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Alas, he nought esteems that face of thine,</LINE>
<LINE>To which Love&#8217;s eyes pays tributary gazes,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor thy soft hands, sweet lips, and crystal eyne,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose full perfection all the world amazes,</LINE>
<COUPLET>But having thee at vantage (wondrous dread!)</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Would root these beauties as he roots the mead.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>O, let him keep his loathsome cabin still!</LINE>
<LINE>Beauty hath nought to do with such foul fiends.</LINE>
<LINE>Come not within his danger by thy will,</LINE>
<LINE>They that thrive well take counsel of their friends.</LINE>
<COUPLET>When thou didst name the boar, not to dissemble,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>I fear&#8217;d thy fortune, and my joints did tremble.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Didst thou not mark my face? was it not white?</LINE>
<LINE>Sawest thou not signs of fear lurk in mine eye?</LINE>
<LINE>Grew I not faint, and fell I not downright?</LINE>
<LINE>Within my bosom, whereon thou dost lie,</LINE>
<COUPLET>My boding heart pants, beats, and takes no rest,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>But like an earthquake, shakes thee on my breast.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>For where Love reigns, disturbing Jealousy</LINE>
<LINE>Doth call himself Affection&#8217;s sentinel,</LINE>
<LINE>Gives false alarms, suggesteth mutiny,</LINE>
<LINE>And in a peaceful hour doth cry, &#8220;Kill, kill!&#8221;</LINE>
<COUPLET>Distemp&#8217;ring gentle Love in his desire,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>As air and water do abate the fire.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>This sour informer, this bate-breeding spy,</LINE>
<LINE>This canker that eats up Love&#8217;s tender spring,</LINE>
<LINE>This carry-tale, dissentious Jealousy,</LINE>
<LINE>That sometime true news, sometime false doth bring,</LINE>
<COUPLET>Knocks at my heart, and whispers in mine ear,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>That if I love thee, I thy death should fear;</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>And more than so, presenteth to mine eye</LINE>
<LINE>The picture of an angry chafing boar,</LINE>
<LINE>Under whose sharp fangs, on his back doth lie</LINE>
<LINE>An image like thyself, all stain&#8217;d with gore,</LINE>
<COUPLET>Whose blood upon the fresh flowers being shed,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Doth make them droop with grief and hang the head.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>What should I do, seeing thee so indeed,</LINE>
<LINE>That tremble at th&#8217; imagination?</LINE>
<LINE>The thought of it doth make my faint heart bleed,</LINE>
<LINE>And fear doth teach it divination:</LINE>
<COUPLET>I prophesy thy death, my living sorrow,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>If thou encounter with the boar tomorrow.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>But if thou needs wilt hunt, be rul&#8217;d by me,</LINE>
<LINE>Uncouple at the timorous flying hare,</LINE>
<LINE>Or at the fox which lives by subtilty,</LINE>
<LINE>Or at the roe which no encounter dare;</LINE>
<COUPLET>Pursue these fearful creatures o&#8217;er the downs,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>And on thy well-breath&#8217;d horse keep with thy hounds.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>And when thou hast on foot the purblind hare,</LINE>
<LINE>Mark the poor wretch, to overshut his troubles,</LINE>
<LINE>How he outruns the wind, and with what care</LINE>
<LINE>He cranks and crosses with a thousand doubles:</LINE>
<COUPLET>The many musits through the which he goes</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Are like a labyrinth to amaze his foes.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Sometime he runs among a flock of sheep,</LINE>
<LINE>To make the cunning hounds mistake their smell,</LINE>
<LINE>And sometime where earth-delving conies keep,</LINE>
<LINE>To stop the loud pursuers in their yell,</LINE>
<COUPLET>And sometime sorteth with a herd of deer:</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Danger deviseth shifts, wit waits on fear.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>For there his smell with others being mingled,</LINE>
<LINE>The hot scent-snuffing hounds are driven to doubt,</LINE>
<LINE>Ceasing their clamorous cry till they have singled</LINE>
<LINE>With much ado the cold fault cleanly out;</LINE>
<COUPLET>Then do they spend their mouths: echo replies,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>As if another chase were in the skies.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>By this, poor Wat, far off upon a hill,</LINE>
<LINE>Stands on his hinder-legs with list&#8217;ning ear,</LINE>
<LINE>To hearken if his foes pursue him still.</LINE>
<LINE>Anon their loud alarums he doth hear,</LINE>
<COUPLET>And now his grief may be compared well</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>To one sore sick that hears the passing bell.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Then shalt thou see the dew-bedabbled wretch</LINE>
<LINE>Turn, and return, indenting with the way;</LINE>
<LINE>Each envious brier his weary legs do scratch,</LINE>
<LINE>Each shadow makes him stop, each murmur stay,</LINE>
<COUPLET>For misery is trodden on by many,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>And being low, never reliev&#8217;d by any.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Lie quietly, and hear a little more,</LINE>
<LINE>Nay, do not struggle, for thou shalt not rise.</LINE>
<LINE>To make thee hate the hunting of the boar,</LINE>
<LINE>Unlike myself thou hear&#8217;st me moralize,</LINE>
<COUPLET>Applying this to that, and so to so,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>For love can comment upon every woe.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Where did I leave?&#8221; &#8220;No matter where,&#8221; quoth he,</LINE>
<LINE>&#8220;Leave me, and then the story aptly ends;</LINE>
<LINE>The night is spent.&#8221; &#8220;Why, what of that?&#8221; quoth she.</LINE>
<LINE>&#8220;I am,&#8221; quoth he, &#8220;expected of my friends,</LINE>
<COUPLET>And now &#8217;tis dark, and going I shall fall.&#8221;</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>&#8220;In night,&#8221; quoth she, &#8220;desire sees best of all.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>But if thou fall, O then imagine this,</LINE>
<LINE>The earth, in love with thee, thy footing trips,</LINE>
<LINE>And all is but to rob thee of a kiss.</LINE>
<LINE>Rich preys make true men thieves; so do thy lips</LINE>
<COUPLET>Make modest Dian cloudy and forlorn,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Lest she should steal a kiss and die forsworn.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Now of this dark night I perceive the reason:</LINE>
<LINE>Cynthia for shame obscures her silver shine,</LINE>
<LINE>Till forging Nature be condemn&#8217;d of treason,</LINE>
<LINE>For stealing moulds from heaven that were divine,</LINE>
<COUPLET>Wherein she fram&#8217;d thee, in high heaven&#8217;s despite,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>To shame the sun by day, and her by night.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>And therefore hath she brib&#8217;d the Destinies</LINE>
<LINE>To cross the curious workmanship of Nature,</LINE>
<LINE>To mingle beauty with infirmities,</LINE>
<LINE>And pure perfection with impure defeature,</LINE>
<COUPLET>Making it subject to the tyranny</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Of mad mischances and much misery:</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>As burning fevers, agues pale and faint,</LINE>
<LINE>Life-poisoning pestilence, and frenzies wood,</LINE>
<LINE>The marrow-eating sickness, whose attaint</LINE>
<LINE>Disorder breeds by heating of the blood;</LINE>
<COUPLET>Surfeits, impostumes, grief, and damn&#8217;d despair</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Swear Nature&#8217;s death for framing thee so fair.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>And not the least of all these maladies</LINE>
<LINE>But in one minute&#8217;s fight brings beauty under;</LINE>
<LINE>Both favor, savor, hue, and qualities,</LINE>
<LINE>Whereat th&#8217; impartial gazer late did wonder,</LINE>
<COUPLET>Are on the sudden wasted, thaw&#8217;d, and done,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>As mountain snow melts with the midday sun.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Therefore despite of fruitless chastity,</LINE>
<LINE>Love-lacking vestals, and self-loving nuns,</LINE>
<LINE>That on the earth would breed a scarcity</LINE>
<LINE>And barren dearth of daughters and of sons,</LINE>
<COUPLET>Be prodigal: the lamp that burns by night</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Dries up his oil to lend the world his light.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>What is thy body but a swallowing grave,</LINE>
<LINE>Seeming to bury that posterity</LINE>
<LINE>Which by the rights of time thou needs must have,</LINE>
<LINE>If thou destroy them not in dark obscurity?</LINE>
<COUPLET>If so, the world will hold thee in disdain,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Sith in thy pride so fair a hope is slain.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>So in thyself thyself art made away,</LINE>
<LINE>A mischief worse than civil home-bred strife,</LINE>
<LINE>Or theirs whose desperate hands themselves do slay,</LINE>
<LINE>Or butcher sire that reaves his son of life.</LINE>
<COUPLET>Foul cank&#8217;ring rust the hidden treasure frets,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>But gold that&#8217;s put to use more gold begets.&#8221;</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>&#8220;Nay then,&#8221; quoth Adon, &#8220;you will fall again</LINE>
<LINE>Into your idle over-handled theme.</LINE>
<LINE>The kiss I gave you is bestow&#8217;d in vain,</LINE>
<LINE>And all in vain you strive against the stream,</LINE>
<COUPLET>For by this black-fac&#8217;d night, desire&#8217;s foul nurse,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Your treatise makes me like you worse and worse.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>If love have lent you twenty thousand tongues,</LINE>
<LINE>And every tongue more moving than your own,</LINE>
<LINE>Bewitching like the wanton mermaids&#8217; songs,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet from mine ear the tempting tune is blown;</LINE>
<COUPLET>For know my heart stands armed in mine ear,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>And will not let a false sound enter there,</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Lest the deceiving harmony should run</LINE>
<LINE>Into the quiet closure of my breast,</LINE>
<LINE>And then my little heart were quite undone,</LINE>
<LINE>In his bedchamber to be barr&#8217;d of rest.</LINE>
<COUPLET>No, lady, no, my heart longs not to groan,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>But soundly sleeps, while now it sleeps alone.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>What have you urg&#8217;d that I cannot reprove?</LINE>
<LINE>The path is smooth that leadeth on to danger.</LINE>
<LINE>I hate not love, but your device in love,</LINE>
<LINE>That lends embracements unto every stranger.</LINE>
<COUPLET>You do it for increase: O strange excuse!</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>When reason is the bawd to lust&#8217;s abuse.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Call it not love, for Love to heaven is fled,</LINE>
<LINE>Since sweating Lust on earth usurp&#8217;d his name,</LINE>
<LINE>Under whose simple semblance he hath fed</LINE>
<LINE>Upon fresh beauty, blotting it with blame;</LINE>
<COUPLET>Which the hot tyrant stains, and soon bereaves,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>As caterpillars do the tender leaves.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Love comforteth like sunshine after rain,</LINE>
<LINE>But Lust&#8217;s effect is tempest after sun;</LINE>
<LINE>Love&#8217;s gentle spring doth always fresh remain,</LINE>
<LINE>Lust&#8217;s winter comes ere summer half be done;</LINE>
<COUPLET>Love surfeits not, Lust like a glutton dies;</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Love is all truth, Lust full of forged lies.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>More I could tell, but more I dare not say,</LINE>
<LINE>The text is old, the orator too green,</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore in sadness, now I will away;</LINE>
<LINE>My face is full of shame, my heart of teen,</LINE>
<COUPLET>Mine ears, that to your wanton talk attended,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Do burn themselves for having so offended.&#8221;</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>With this he breaketh from the sweet embrace</LINE>
<LINE>Of those fair arms which bound him to her breast,</LINE>
<LINE>And homeward through the dark laund runs apace,</LINE>
<LINE>Leaves Love upon her back, deeply distress&#8217;d.</LINE>
<COUPLET>Look how a bright star shooteth from the sky,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>So glides he in the night from Venus&#8217; eye,</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Which after him she darts, as one on shore</LINE>
<LINE>Gazing upon a late embarked friend,</LINE>
<LINE>Till the wild waves will have him seen no more,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose ridges with the meeting clouds contend;</LINE>
<COUPLET>So did the merciless and pitchy night</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Fold in the object that did feed her sight.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Whereat amaz&#8217;d as one that unaware</LINE>
<LINE>Hath dropp&#8217;d a precious jewel in the flood,</LINE>
<LINE>Or stonish&#8217;d as night-wand&#8217;rers often are,</LINE>
<LINE>Their light blown out in some mistrustful wood,</LINE>
<COUPLET>Even so confounded in the dark she lay,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Having lost the fair discovery of her way.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>And now she beats her heart, whereat it groans,</LINE>
<LINE>That all the neighbor caves, as seeming troubled,</LINE>
<LINE>Make verbal repetition of her moans;</LINE>
<LINE>Passion on passion deeply is redoubled:</LINE>
<COUPLET>&#8220;Ay me!&#8221; she cries, and twenty times, &#8220;Woe, woe!&#8221;</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>And twenty echoes twenty times cry so.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>She marking them begins a wailing note,</LINE>
<LINE>And sings extemporally a woeful ditty,</LINE>
<LINE>How love makes young men thrall, and old men dote,</LINE>
<LINE>How love is wise in folly, foolish witty.</LINE>
<COUPLET>Her heavy anthem still concludes in woe,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>And still the choir of echoes answer so.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Her song was tedious, and outwore the night,</LINE>
<LINE>For lovers&#8217; hours are long, though seeming short;</LINE>
<LINE>If pleas&#8217;d themselves, others they think delight</LINE>
<LINE>In such-like circumstance, with such-like sport.</LINE>
<COUPLET>Their copious stories, oftentimes begun,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>End without audience, and are never done.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>For who hath she to spend the night withal,</LINE>
<LINE>But idle sounds resembling parasits,</LINE>
<LINE>Like shrill-tongu&#8217;d tapsters answering every call,</LINE>
<LINE>Soothing the humor of fantastic wits?</LINE>
<COUPLET>She says, &#8220;&#8217;Tis so,&#8221; they answer all, &#8220;&#8217;Tis so,&#8221;</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>And would say after her, if she said &#8220;No.&#8221;</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Lo here the gentle lark, weary of rest,</LINE>
<LINE>From his moist cabinet mounts up on high,</LINE>
<LINE>And wakes the morning, from whose silver breast</LINE>
<LINE>The sun ariseth in his majesty,</LINE>
<COUPLET>Who doth the world so gloriously behold</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>That cedar tops and hills seem burnish&#8217;d gold.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Venus salutes him with this fair good morrow:</LINE>
<LINE>&#8220;O thou clear god, and patron of all light,</LINE>
<LINE>From whom each lamp and shining star doth borrow</LINE>
<LINE>The beauteous influence that makes him bright,</LINE>
<COUPLET>There lives a son that suck&#8217;d an earthly mother,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>May lend thee light, as thou dost lend to other.&#8221;</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>This said, she hasteth to a myrtle grove,</LINE>
<LINE>Musing the morning is so much o&#8217;erworn,</LINE>
<LINE>And yet she hears no tidings of her love.</LINE>
<LINE>She hearkens for his hounds and for his horn;</LINE>
<COUPLET>Anon she hears them chaunt it lustily,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>And all in haste she coasteth to the cry.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>And as she runs, the bushes in the way,</LINE>
<LINE>Some catch her by the neck, some kiss her face,</LINE>
<LINE>Some twin&#8217;d about her thigh to make her stay.</LINE>
<LINE>She wildly breaketh from their strict embrace,</LINE>
<COUPLET>Like a milch doe, whose swelling dugs do ache,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Hasting to feed her fawn hid in some brake.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>By this she hears the hounds are at a bay,</LINE>
<LINE>Whereat she starts like one that spies an adder</LINE>
<LINE>Wreath&#8217;d up in fatal folds just in his way,</LINE>
<LINE>The fear whereof doth make him shake and shudder;</LINE>
<COUPLET>Even so the timorous yelping of the hounds</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Appalls her senses, and her spirit confounds.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>For now she knows it is no gentle chase,</LINE>
<LINE>But the blunt boar, rough bear, or lion proud,</LINE>
<LINE>Because the cry remaineth in one place,</LINE>
<LINE>Where fearfully the dogs exclaim aloud;</LINE>
<COUPLET>Finding their enemy to be so curst,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>They all strain court&#8217;sy who shall cope him first.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>This dismal cry rings sadly in her ear,</LINE>
<LINE>Through which it enters to surprise her heart,</LINE>
<LINE>Who overcome by doubt, and bloodless fear,</LINE>
<LINE>With cold-pale weakness numbs each feeling part:</LINE>
<COUPLET>Like soldiers when their captain once doth yield,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>They basely fly, and dare not stay the field.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Thus stands she in a trembling ecstasy,</LINE>
<LINE>Till cheering up her senses all dismay&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>She tells them &#8217;tis a causeless fantasy,</LINE>
<LINE>And childish error that they are afraid;</LINE>
<COUPLET>Bids them leave quaking, bids them fear no more&#8212;</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>And with that word, she spied the hunted boar,</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Whose frothy mouth bepainted all with red,</LINE>
<LINE>Like milk and blood being mingled both together,</LINE>
<LINE>A second fear through all her sinews spread,</LINE>
<LINE>Which madly hurries her she knows not whither;</LINE>
<COUPLET>This way she runs, and now she will no further,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>But back retires to rate the boar for murder.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>A thousand spleens bear her a thousand ways,</LINE>
<LINE>She treads the path that she untreads again;</LINE>
<LINE>Her more than haste is mated with delays,</LINE>
<LINE>Like the proceedings of a drunken brain,</LINE>
<COUPLET>Full of respects, yet nought at all respecting,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>In hand with all things, nought at all effecting.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Here kennell&#8217;d in a brake she finds a hound,</LINE>
<LINE>And asks the weary caitiff for his master,</LINE>
<LINE>And there another licking of his wound,</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Gainst venom&#8217;d sores the only sovereign plaster,</LINE>
<COUPLET>And here she meets another sadly scowling,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>To whom she speaks, and he replies with howling.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>When he hath ceas&#8217;d his ill-resounding noise,</LINE>
<LINE>Another flap-mouth&#8217;d mourner, black and grim,</LINE>
<LINE>Against the welkin volleys out his voice;</LINE>
<LINE>Another, and another, answer him,</LINE>
<COUPLET>Clapping their proud tails to the ground below,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Shaking their scratch&#8217;d ears, bleeding as they go.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Look how the world&#8217;s poor people are amazed</LINE>
<LINE>At apparitions, signs, and prodigies,</LINE>
<LINE>Whereon with fearful eyes they long have gazed,</LINE>
<LINE>Infusing them with dreadful prophecies;</LINE>
<COUPLET>So she at these sad signs draws up her breath,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>And sighing it again, exclaims on Death.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>&#8220;Hard-favor&#8217;d tyrant, ugly, meagre, lean,</LINE>
<LINE>Hateful divorce of love&#8221;&#8212;thus chides she Death&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>&#8220;Grim-grinning ghost, earth&#8217;s worm, what dost thou mean</LINE>
<LINE>To stifle beauty, and to steal his breath?</LINE>
<COUPLET>Who when he liv&#8217;d, his breath and beauty set</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Gloss on the rose, smell to the violet.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>If he be dead&#8212;O no, it cannot be,</LINE>
<LINE>Seeing his beauty, thou shouldst strike at it:</LINE>
<LINE>O yes, it may, thou hast no eyes to see,</LINE>
<LINE>But hatefully at randon dost thou hit.</LINE>
<COUPLET>Thy mark is feeble age, but thy false dart</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Mistakes that aim, and cleaves an infant&#8217;s heart.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Hadst thou but bid beware, then he had spoke,</LINE>
<LINE>And hearing him, thy power had lost his power.</LINE>
<LINE>The Destinies will curse thee for this stroke:</LINE>
<LINE>They bid thee crop a weed, thou pluck&#8217;st a flower.</LINE>
<COUPLET>Love&#8217;s golden arrow at him should have fled,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>And not Death&#8217;s ebon dart to strike him dead.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Dost thou drink tears, that thou provok&#8217;st such weeping?</LINE>
<LINE>What may a heavy groan advantage thee?</LINE>
<LINE>Why hast thou cast into eternal sleeping</LINE>
<LINE>Those eyes that taught all other eyes to see?</LINE>
<COUPLET>Now Nature cares not for thy mortal vigor,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Since her best work is ruin&#8217;d with thy rigor.&#8221;</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Here overcome, as one full of despair,</LINE>
<LINE>She vail&#8217;d her eyelids, who like sluices stopp&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>The crystal tide that from her two cheeks fair</LINE>
<LINE>In the sweet channel of her bosom dropp&#8217;d;</LINE>
<COUPLET>But through the flood-gates breaks the silver rain,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>And with his strong course opens them again.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>O how her eyes and tears did lend and borrow!</LINE>
<LINE>Her eye seen in the tears, tears in her eye,</LINE>
<LINE>Both crystals, where they view&#8217;d each other&#8217;s sorrow,</LINE>
<LINE>Sorrow that friendly sighs sought still to dry;</LINE>
<COUPLET>But like a stormy day, now wind, now rain,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Sighs dry her cheeks, tears make them wet again.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Variable passions throng her constant woe,</LINE>
<LINE>As striving who should best become her grief;</LINE>
<LINE>All entertain&#8217;d, each passion labors so,</LINE>
<LINE>That every present sorrow seemeth chief,</LINE>
<COUPLET>But none is best; then join they all together,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Like many clouds consulting for foul weather.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>By this, far off, she hears some huntsman hallow;</LINE>
<LINE>A nurse&#8217;s song ne&#8217;er pleas&#8217;d her babe so well.</LINE>
<LINE>The dire imagination she did follow</LINE>
<LINE>This sound of hope doth labor to expel,</LINE>
<COUPLET>For now reviving joy bids her rejoice,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>And flatters her it is Adonis&#8217; voice.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Whereat her tears began to turn their tide,</LINE>
<LINE>Being prison&#8217;d in her eye, like pearls in glass,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet sometimes falls an orient drop beside,</LINE>
<LINE>Which her cheek melts, as scorning it should pass</LINE>
<COUPLET>To wash the foul face of the sluttish ground,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Who is but drunken when she seemeth drown&#8217;d.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>O hard-believing love, how strange it seems!</LINE>
<LINE>Not to believe, and yet too credulous:</LINE>
<LINE>Thy weal and woe are both of them extremes;</LINE>
<LINE>Despair and hope makes thee ridiculous:</LINE>
<COUPLET>The one doth flatter thee in thoughts unlikely,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>In likely thoughts the other kills thee quickly.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Now she unweaves the web that she hath wrought,</LINE>
<LINE>Adonis lives, and Death is not to blame;</LINE>
<LINE>It was not she that call&#8217;d him all to naught;</LINE>
<LINE>Now she adds honors to his hateful name:</LINE>
<COUPLET>She clepes him king of graves, and grave for kings,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Imperious supreme of all mortal things.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; quoth she, &#8220;sweet Death, I did but jest,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet pardon me, I felt a kind of fear</LINE>
<LINE>When as I met the boar, that bloody beast,</LINE>
<LINE>Which knows no pity, but is still severe;</LINE>
<COUPLET>Then, gentle shadow (truth I must confess),</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>I rail&#8217;d on thee, fearing my love&#8217;s decesse.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis not my fault, the boar provok&#8217;d my tongue,</LINE>
<LINE>Be wreak&#8217;d on him, invisible commander;</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis he, foul creature, that hath done thee wrong,</LINE>
<LINE>I did but act, he&#8217;s author of thy slander.</LINE>
<COUPLET>Grief hath two tongues, and never woman yet</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Could rule them both without ten women&#8217;s wit.&#8221;</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Thus hoping that Adonis is alive,</LINE>
<LINE>Her rash suspect she doth extenuate,</LINE>
<LINE>And that his beauty may the better thrive,</LINE>
<LINE>With Death she humbly doth insinuate;</LINE>
<COUPLET>Tells him of trophies, statues, tombs, and stories</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>His victories, his triumphs, and his glories.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>&#8220;O Jove,&#8221; quoth she, &#8220;how much a fool was I,</LINE>
<LINE>To be of such a weak and silly mind,</LINE>
<LINE>To wail his death who lives, and must not die</LINE>
<LINE>Till mutual overthrow of mortal kind!</LINE>
<COUPLET>For he being dead, with him is beauty slain,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>And beauty dead, black chaos comes again.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Fie, fie, fond love, thou art as full of fear</LINE>
<LINE>As one with treasure laden, hemm&#8217;d with thieves;</LINE>
<LINE>Trifles, unwitnessed with eye or ear,</LINE>
<LINE>Thy coward heart with false bethinking grieves.&#8221;</LINE>
<COUPLET>Even at this word she hears a merry horn,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Whereat she leaps, that was but late forlorn.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>As falcons to the lure, away she flies,</LINE>
<LINE>The grass stoops not, she treads on it so light,</LINE>
<LINE>And in her haste unfortunately spies</LINE>
<LINE>The foul boar&#8217;s conquest on her fair delight,</LINE>
<COUPLET>Which seen, her eyes as murd&#8217;red with the view,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Like stars asham&#8217;d of day, themselves withdrew;</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Or as the snail, whose tender horns being hit,</LINE>
<LINE>Shrinks backward in his shelly cave with pain,</LINE>
<LINE>And there, all smoth&#8217;red up, in shade doth sit,</LINE>
<LINE>Long after fearing to creep forth again;</LINE>
<COUPLET>So at his bloody view her eyes are fled</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Into the deep-dark cabins of her head,</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Where they resign their office, and their light,</LINE>
<LINE>To the disposing of her troubled brain,</LINE>
<LINE>Who bids them still consort with ugly night,</LINE>
<LINE>And never wound the heart with looks again,</LINE>
<COUPLET>Who like a king perplexed in his throne,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>By their suggestion, gives a deadly groan.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Whereat each tributary subject quakes,</LINE>
<LINE>As when the wind imprison&#8217;d in the ground,</LINE>
<LINE>Struggling for passage, earth&#8217;s foundation shakes,</LINE>
<LINE>Which with cold terror doth men&#8217;s minds confound.</LINE>
<COUPLET>This mutiny each part doth so surprise</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>That from their dark beds once more leap her eyes,</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>And being open&#8217;d, threw unwilling light</LINE>
<LINE>Upon the wide wound that the boar had trench&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>In his soft flank, whose wonted lily white</LINE>
<LINE>With purple tears, that his wound wept, was drench&#8217;d.</LINE>
<COUPLET>No flow&#8217;r was nigh, no grass, herb, leaf, or weed,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>But stole his blood, and seem&#8217;d with him to bleed.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>This solemn sympathy poor Venus noteth,</LINE>
<LINE>Over one shoulder doth she hang her head;</LINE>
<LINE>Dumbly she passions, franticly she doteth,</LINE>
<LINE>She thinks he could not die, he is not dead;</LINE>
<COUPLET>Her voice is stopp&#8217;d, her joints forget to bow,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Her eyes are mad that they have wept till now.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Upon his hurt she looks so steadfastly,</LINE>
<LINE>That her sight dazzling makes the wound seem three,</LINE>
<LINE>And then she reprehends her mangling eye,</LINE>
<LINE>That makes more gashes where no breach should be.</LINE>
<COUPLET>His face seems twain, each several limb is doubled,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>For oft the eye mistakes, the brain being troubled.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>&#8220;My tongue cannot express my grief for one,</LINE>
<LINE>And yet,&#8221; quoth she, &#8220;behold two Adons dead!</LINE>
<LINE>My sighs are blown away, my salt tears gone,</LINE>
<LINE>Mine eyes are turn&#8217;d to fire, my heart to lead:</LINE>
<COUPLET>Heavy heart&#8217;s lead, melt at mine eyes&#8217; red fire,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>So shall I die by drops of hot desire.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Alas, poor world, what treasure hast thou lost!</LINE>
<LINE>What face remains alive that&#8217;s worth the viewing?</LINE>
<LINE>Whose tongue is music now? what canst thou boast</LINE>
<LINE>Of things long since, or any thing ensuing?</LINE>
<COUPLET>The flowers are sweet, their colors fresh and trim,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>But true sweet beauty liv&#8217;d and died with him.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Bonnet nor veil henceforth no creature wear!</LINE>
<LINE>Nor sun nor wind will ever strive to kiss you:</LINE>
<LINE>Having no fair to lose, you need not fear,</LINE>
<LINE>The sun doth scorn you, and the wind doth hiss you.</LINE>
<COUPLET>But when Adonis liv&#8217;d, sun and sharp air</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Lurk&#8217;d like two thieves, to rob him of his fair.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>And therefore would he put his bonnet on,</LINE>
<LINE>Under whose brim the gaudy sun would peep;</LINE>
<LINE>The wind would blow it off, and being gone,</LINE>
<LINE>Play with his locks; then would Adonis weep;</LINE>
<COUPLET>And straight, in pity of his tender years,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>They both would strive who first should dry his tears.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>To see his face the lion walk&#8217;d along</LINE>
<LINE>Behind some hedge, because he would not fear him;</LINE>
<LINE>To recreate himself when he hath song,</LINE>
<LINE>The tiger would be tame, and gently hear him;</LINE>
<COUPLET>If he had spoke, the wolf would leave his prey,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>And never fright the silly lamb that day.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>When he beheld his shadow in the brook,</LINE>
<LINE>The fishes spread on it their golden gills;</LINE>
<LINE>When he was by, the birds such pleasure took,</LINE>
<LINE>That some would sing, some other in their bills</LINE>
<COUPLET>Would bring him mulberries and ripe-red cherries:</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>He fed them with his sight, they him with berries.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>But this foul, grim, and urchin-snouted boar,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose downward eye still looketh for a grave,</LINE>
<LINE>Ne&#8217;er saw the beauteous livery that he wore&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Witness the entertainment that he gave.</LINE>
<COUPLET>If he did see his face, why then I know</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>He thought to kiss him, and hath kill&#8217;d him so.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis true, &#8217;tis true, thus was Adonis slain:</LINE>
<LINE>He ran upon the boar with his sharp spear,</LINE>
<LINE>Who did not whet his teeth at him again,</LINE>
<LINE>But by a kiss thought to persuade him there;</LINE>
<COUPLET>And nousling in his flank, the loving swine</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Sheath&#8217;d unaware the tusk in his soft groin.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Had I been tooth&#8217;d like him, I must confess,</LINE>
<LINE>With kissing him I should have kill&#8217;d him first,</LINE>
<LINE>But he is dead, and never did he bless</LINE>
<LINE>My youth with his, the more am I accurs&#8217;d.&#8221;</LINE>
<COUPLET>With this she falleth in the place she stood,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>And stains her face with his congealed blood.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>She looks upon his lips, and they are pale,</LINE>
<LINE>She takes him by the hand, and that is cold,</LINE>
<LINE>She whispers in his ears a heavy tale,</LINE>
<LINE>As if they heard the woeful words she told;</LINE>
<COUPLET>She lifts the coffer-lids that close his eyes,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Where lo, two lamps burnt out in darkness lies;</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Two glasses, where herself herself beheld</LINE>
<LINE>A thousand times, and now no more reflect,</LINE>
<LINE>Their virtue lost, wherein they late excell&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>And every beauty robb&#8217;d of his effect.</LINE>
<COUPLET>&#8220;Wonder of time,&#8221; quoth she, &#8220;this is my spite,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>That thou being dead, the day should yet be light.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Since thou art dead, lo here I prophesy,</LINE>
<LINE>Sorrow on love hereafter shall attend;</LINE>
<LINE>It shall be waited on with jealousy,</LINE>
<LINE>Find sweet beginning, but unsavory end;</LINE>
<COUPLET>ne&#8217;er settled equally, but high or low,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>That all love&#8217;s pleasure shall not match his woe.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>It shall be fickle, false, and full of fraud,</LINE>
<LINE>Bud, and be blasted, in a breathing while,</LINE>
<LINE>The bottom poison, and the top o&#8217;erstraw&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>With sweets that shall the truest sight beguile;</LINE>
<COUPLET>The strongest body shall it make most weak,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Strike the wise dumb, and teach the fool to speak.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>It shall be sparing, and too full of riot,</LINE>
<LINE>Teaching decrepit age to tread the measures;</LINE>
<LINE>The staring ruffian shall it keep in quiet,</LINE>
<LINE>Pluck down the rich, enrich the poor with treasures;</LINE>
<COUPLET>It shall be raging mad, and silly mild,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Make the young old, the old become a child.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>It shall suspect where is no cause of fear,</LINE>
<LINE>It shall not fear where it should most mistrust,</LINE>
<LINE>It shall be merciful, and too severe,</LINE>
<LINE>And most deceiving when it seems most just;</LINE>
<COUPLET>Perverse it shall be, where it shows most toward,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Put fear to valor, courage to the coward.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>It shall be cause of war and dire events,</LINE>
<LINE>And set dissension &#8217;twixt the son and sire,</LINE>
<LINE>Subject and servile to all discontents,</LINE>
<LINE>As dry combustious matter is to fire.</LINE>
<COUPLET>Sith in his prime, Death doth my love destroy,</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>They that love best, their loves shall not enjoy.&#8221;</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>By this the boy that by her side lay kill&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>Was melted like a vapor from her sight,</LINE>
<LINE>And in his blood that on the ground lay spill&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>A purple flow&#8217;r sprung up, check&#8217;red with white,</LINE>
<COUPLET>Resembling well his pale cheeks and the blood</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Which in round drops upon their whiteness stood.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>She bows her head, the new-sprung flow&#8217;r to smell,</LINE>
<LINE>Comparing it to her Adonis&#8217; breath,</LINE>
<LINE>And says within her bosom it shall dwell,</LINE>
<LINE>Since he himself is reft from her by death.</LINE>
<COUPLET>She crops the stalk, and in the breach appears</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Green-dropping sap, which she compares to tears.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>&#8220;Poor flow&#8217;r,&#8221; quoth she, &#8220;this was thy father&#8217;s guise&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Sweet issue of a more sweet-smelling sire&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>For every little grief to wet his eyes;</LINE>
<LINE>To grow unto himself was his desire,</LINE>
<COUPLET>And so &#8217;tis thine, but know it is as good</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>To wither in my breast as in his blood.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Here was thy father&#8217;s bed, here in my breast;</LINE>
<LINE>Thou art the next of blood, and &#8217;tis thy right.</LINE>
<LINE>Lo in this hollow cradle take thy rest,</LINE>
<LINE>My throbbing heart shall rock thee day and night;</LINE>
<COUPLET>There shall not be one minute in an hour</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Wherein I will not kiss my sweet love&#8217;s flow&#8217;r.&#8221;</COUPLET>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Thus weary of the world, away she hies,</LINE>
<LINE>And yokes her silver doves, by whose swift aid</LINE>
<LINE>Their mistress mounted through the empty skies,</LINE>
<LINE>In her light chariot, quickly is convey&#8217;d,</LINE>
<COUPLET>Holding their course to Paphos, where their queen</COUPLET>
<COUPLET>Means to immure herself, and not be seen.</COUPLET>
</STANZA>
