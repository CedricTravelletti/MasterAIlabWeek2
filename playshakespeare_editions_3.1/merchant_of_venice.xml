<stagedir>Enter Antonio, Salerio, and Solanio.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>ANT.</speaker>
<line>In sooth, I know not why I am so sad;</line>
<line>It wearies me, you say it wearies you;</line>
<line>But how I caught it, found it, or came by it,</line>
<line>What stuff &#8217;tis made of, whereof it is born,</line>
<line>I am to learn;</line>
<line>And such a want-wit sadness makes of me,</line>
<line>That I have much ado to know myself.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SAL.</speaker>
<line>Your mind is tossing on the ocean,</line>
<line>There where your argosies with portly sail</line>
<line>Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood,</line>
<line>Or as it were the pageants of the sea,</line>
<line>Do overpeer the petty traffickers</line>
<line>That cur&#8217;sy to them, do them reverence,</line>
<line>As they fly by them with their woven wings.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SOL.</speaker>
<line>Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth,</line>
<line>The better part of my affections would</line>
<line>Be with my hopes abroad. I should be still</line>
<line>Plucking the grass to know where sits the wind,</line>
<line>Piring in maps for ports and piers and roads;</line>
<line>And every object that might make me fear</line>
<line>Misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt</line>
<line>Would make me sad.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SAL.</speaker>
<line offset="4">My wind cooling my broth</line>
<line>Would blow me to an ague when I thought</line>
<line>What harm a wind too great might do at sea.</line>
<line>I should not see the sandy hour-glass run</line>
<line>But I should think of shallows and of flats,</line>
<line>And see my wealthy Andrew dock&#8217;d in sand,</line>
<line>Vailing her high top lower than her ribs</line>
<line>To kiss her burial. Should I go to church</line>
<line>And see the holy edifice of stone,</line>
<line>And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks,</line>
<line>Which touching but my gentle vessel&#8217;s side</line>
<line>Would scatter all her spices on the stream,</line>
<line>Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks,</line>
<line>And in a word, but even now worth this,</line>
<line>And now worth nothing? Shall I have the thought</line>
<line>To think on this, and shall I lack the thought</line>
<line>That such a thing bechanc&#8217;d would make me sad?</line>
<line>But tell not me; I know Antonio</line>
<line>Is sad to think upon his merchandise.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANT.</speaker>
<line>Believe me, no. I thank my fortune for it,</line>
<line>My ventures are not in one bottom trusted,</line>
<line>Nor to one place; nor is my whole estate</line>
<line>Upon the fortune of this present year:</line>
<line>Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SOL.</speaker>
<line>Why then you are in love.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANT.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Fie, fie!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SOL.</speaker>
<line>Not in love neither? Then let us say you are sad</line>
<line>Because you are not merry; and &#8217;twere as easy</line>
<line>For you to laugh and leap, and say you are merry</line>
<line>Because you are not sad. Now by two-headed Janus,</line>
<line>Nature hath fram&#8217;d strange fellows in her time:</line>
<line>Some that will evermore peep through their eyes,</line>
<line>And laugh like parrots at a bagpiper;</line>
<line>And other of such vinegar aspect</line>
<line>That they&#8217;ll not show their teeth in way of smile</line>
<line>Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable.</line>

<stagedir>Enter Bassanio, Lorenzo, and Gratiano.</stagedir>
<line>Here comes Bassanio, your most noble kinsman,</line>
<line>Gratiano, and Lorenzo. Fare ye well,</line>
<line>We leave you now with better company.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SAL.</speaker>
<line>I would have stay&#8217;d till I had made you merry,</line>
<line>If worthier friends had not prevented me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANT.</speaker>
<line>Your worth is very dear in my regard.</line>
<line>I take it your own business calls on you,</line>
<line>And you embrace th&#8217; occasion to depart.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SAL.</speaker>
<line>Good morrow, my good lords.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BASS.</speaker>
<line>Good signiors both, when shall we laugh? Say, when?</line>
<line>You grow exceeding strange. Must it be so?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SAL.</speaker>
<line>We&#8217;ll make our leisures to attend on yours.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exeunt Salerio and Solanio.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>LOR.</speaker>
<line>My Lord Bassanio, since you have found Antonio,</line>
<line>We two will leave you, but at dinner-time</line>
<line>I pray you have in mind where we must meet.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BASS.</speaker>
<line>I will not fail you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GRA.</speaker>
<line>You look not well, Signior Antonio,</line>
<line>You have too much respect upon the world.</line>
<line>They lose it that do buy it with much care.</line>
<line>Believe me you are marvellously chang&#8217;d.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANT.</speaker>
<line>I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano,</line>
<line>A stage, where every man must play a part,</line>
<line>And mine a sad one.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GRA.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Let me play the fool,</line>
<line>With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come,</line>
<line>And let my liver rather heat with wine</line>
<line>Than my heart cool with mortifying groans.</line>
<line>Why should a man, whose blood is warm within,</line>
<line>Sit like his grandsire cut in alablaster?</line>
<line>Sleep when he wakes? And creep into the jaundies</line>
<line>By being peevish? I tell thee what, Antonio&#8212;</line>
<line>I love thee, and &#8217;tis my love that speaks&#8212;</line>
<line>There are a sort of men whose visages</line>
<line>Do cream and mantle like a standing pond,</line>
<line>And do a willful stillness entertain,</line>
<line>With purpose to be dress&#8217;d in an opinion</line>
<line>Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit,</line>
<line>As who should say, &#8220;I am Sir Oracle,</line>
<line>And when I ope my lips let no dog bark!&#8221;</line>
<line>O my Antonio, I do know of these</line>
<line>That therefore only are reputed wise</line>
<line>For saying nothing; when I am very sure</line>
<line>If they should speak, would almost damn those ears</line>
<line>Which hearing them would call their brothers fools.</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll tell thee more of this another time;</line>
<line>But fish not with this melancholy bait</line>
<line>For this fool gudgeon, this opinion.</line>
<line>Come, good Lorenzo. Fare ye well a while,</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll end my exhortation after dinner.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LOR.</speaker>
<line>Well, we will leave you then till dinner-time.</line>
<line>I must be one of these same dumb wise men,</line>
<line>For Gratiano never lets me speak.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GRA.</speaker>
<line>Well, keep me company but two years more,</line>
<line>Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANT.</speaker>
<line>Fare you well! I&#8217;ll grow a talker for this gear.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GRA.</speaker>
<line>Thanks, i&#8217; faith, for silence is only commendable</line>
<line>In a neat&#8217;s tongue dried and a maid not vendible.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exeunt Gratiano and Lorenzo.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>ANT.</speaker>
<line>It is that&#8212;any thing now!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BASS.</speaker>
<line>Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, more than any man in all Venice. His reasons are as two grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff; you shall seek all day ere you find them, and when you have them, they are not worth the search.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANT.</speaker>
<line>Well, tell me now what lady is the same</line>
<line>To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage,</line>
<line>That you today promis&#8217;d to tell me of?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BASS.</speaker>
<line>&#8217;Tis not unknown to you, Antonio,</line>
<line>How much I have disabled mine estate,</line>
<line>By something showing a more swelling port</line>
<line>Than my faint means would grant continuance.</line>
<line>Nor do I now make moan to be abridg&#8217;d</line>
<line>From such a noble rate, but my chief care</line>
<line>Is to come fairly off from the great debts</line>
<line>Wherein my time something too prodigal</line>
<line>Hath left me gag&#8217;d. To you, Antonio,</line>
<line>I owe the most in money and in love,</line>
<line>And from your love I have a warranty</line>
<line>To unburden all my plots and purposes</line>
<line>How to get clear of all the debts I owe.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANT.</speaker>
<line>I pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it,</line>
<line>And if it stand, as you yourself still do,</line>
<line>Within the eye of honor, be assur&#8217;d</line>
<line>My purse, my person, my extremest means,</line>
<line>Lie all unlock&#8217;d to your occasions.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BASS.</speaker>
<line>In my school-days, when I had lost one shaft,</line>
<line>I shot his fellow of the self-same flight</line>
<line>The self-same way with more advised watch</line>
<line>To find the other forth, and by adventuring both</line>
<line>I oft found both. I urge this childhood proof,</line>
<line>Because what follows is pure innocence.</line>
<line>I owe you much, and like a willful youth,</line>
<line>That which I owe is lost, but if you please</line>
<line>To shoot another arrow that self way</line>
<line>Which you did shoot the first, I do not doubt,</line>
<line>As I will watch the aim, or to find both</line>
<line>Or bring your latter hazard back again,</line>
<line>And thankfully rest debtor for the first.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANT.</speaker>
<line>You know me well, and herein spend but time</line>
<line>To wind about my love with circumstance,</line>
<line>And out of doubt you do me now more wrong</line>
<line>In making question of my uttermost</line>
<line>Than if you had made waste of all I have.</line>
<line>Then do but say to me what I should do</line>
<line>That in your knowledge may by me be done,</line>
<line>And I am prest unto it; therefore speak.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BASS.</speaker>
<line>In Belmont is a lady richly left,</line>
<line>And she is fair and, fairer than that word,</line>
<line>Of wondrous virtues. Sometimes from her eyes</line>
<line>I did receive fair speechless messages.</line>
<line>Her name is Portia, nothing undervalu&#8217;d</line>
<line>To Cato&#8217;s daughter, Brutus&#8217; Portia.</line>
<line>Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth,</line>
<line>For the four winds blow in from every coast</line>
<line>Renowned suitors, and her sunny locks</line>
<line>Hang on her temples like a golden fleece,</line>
<line>Which makes her seat of Belmont Colchis&#8217; strond,</line>
<line>And many Jasons come in quest of her.</line>
<line>O my Antonio, had I but the means</line>
<line>To hold a rival place with one of them,</line>
<line>I have a mind presages me such thrift</line>
<line>That I should questionless be fortunate!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANT.</speaker>
<line>Thou know&#8217;st that all my fortunes are at sea,</line>
<line>Neither have I money nor commodity</line>
<line>To raise a present sum; therefore go forth,</line>
<line>Try what my credit can in Venice do.</line>
<line>That shall be rack&#8217;d, even to the uttermost,</line>
<line>To furnish thee to Belmont, to fair Portia.</line>
<line>Go presently inquire, and so will I,</line>
<line>Where money is, and I no question make</line>
<line>To have it of my trust, or for my sake.</line>
</speech>

<scenelocation>Belmont. A room in Portia&#8217;s house.</scenelocation>
<scenepersonae>(Portia, Nerissa, Servingman)</scenepersonae>

<stagedir>Enter Portia with her waiting-woman, Nerissa.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>POR.</speaker>
<line>By my troth, Nerissa, my little body is a-weary of this great world.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NER.</speaker>
<line>You would be, sweet madam, if your miseries were in the same abundance as your good fortunes are; and yet for aught I see, they are as sick that surfeit with too much as they that starve with nothing. It is no mean happiness therefore to be seated in the mean: superfluity comes sooner by white hairs, but competency lives longer.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POR.</speaker>
<line>Good sentences, and well pronounc&#8217;d.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NER.</speaker>
<line>They would be better if well follow&#8217;d.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POR.</speaker>
<line>If to do were as easy as to know what were good to do, chapels had been churches, and poor men&#8217;s cottages princes&#8217; palaces. It is a good divine that follows his own instructions; I can easier teach twenty what were good to be done, than to be one of the twenty to follow mine own teaching. The brain may devise laws for the blood, but a hot temper leaps o&#8217;er a cold decree&#8212;such a hare is madness the youth, to skip o&#8217;er the meshes of good counsel the cripple. But this reasoning is not in the fashion to choose me a husband. O me, the word choose! I may neither choose who I would, nor refuse who I dislike; so is the will of a living daughter curb&#8217;d by the will of a dead father. Is it not hard, Nerissa, that I cannot choose one, nor refuse none?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NER.</speaker>
<line>Your father was ever virtuous, and holy men at their death have good inspirations; therefore the lott&#8217;ry that he hath devis&#8217;d in these three chests of gold, silver, and lead, whereof who chooses his meaning chooses you, will no doubt never be chosen by any rightly but one who you shall rightly love. But what warmth is there in your affection towards any of these princely suitors that are already come?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POR.</speaker>
<line>I pray thee over-name them, and as thou namest them, I will describe them; and according to my description level at my affection.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NER.</speaker>
<line>First, there is the Neapolitan prince.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POR.</speaker>
<line>Ay, that&#8217;s a colt indeed, for he doth nothing but talk of his horse, and he makes it a great appropriation to his own good parts that he can shoe him himself. I am much afeard my lady his mother play&#8217;d false with a smith.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NER.</speaker>
<line>Then is there the County Palentine.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POR.</speaker>
<line>He doth nothing but frown, as who should say, &#8220;And you will not have me, choose.&#8221; He hears merry tales and smiles not. I fear he will prove the weeping philosopher when he grows old, being so full of unmannerly sadness in his youth. I had rather be married to a death&#8217;s-head with a bone in his mouth than to either of these. God defend me from these two!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NER.</speaker>
<line>How say you by the French lord, Monsieur Le Bon?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POR.</speaker>
<line>God made him, and therefore let him pass for a man. In truth, I know it is a sin to be a mocker, but he! Why, he hath a horse better than the Neapolitan&#8217;s, a better bad habit of frowning than the Count Palentine; he is every man in no man. If a throstle sing, he falls straight a-cap&#8217;ring. He will fence with his own shadow. If I should marry him, I should marry twenty husbands. If he would despise me, I would forgive him, for if he love me to madness, I shall never requite him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NER.</speaker>
<line>What say you then to Falconbridge, the young baron of England?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POR.</speaker>
<line>You know I say nothing to him, for he understands not me, nor I him. He hath neither Latin, French, nor Italian, and you will come into the court and swear that I have a poor pennyworth in the English. He is a proper man&#8217;s picture, but alas, who can converse with a dumb show? How oddly he is suited! I think he bought his doublet in Italy, his round hose in France, his bonnet in Germany, and his behavior every where.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NER.</speaker>
<line>What think you of the Scottish lord, his neighbor?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POR.</speaker>
<line>That he hath a neighborly charity in him, for he borrow&#8217;d a box of the ear of the Englishman, and swore he would pay him again when he was able. I think the Frenchman became his surety and seal&#8217;d under for another.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NER.</speaker>
<line>How like you the young German, the Duke of Saxony&#8217;s nephew?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POR.</speaker>
<line>Very vildly in the morning, when he is sober, and most vildly in the afternoon, when he is drunk. When he is best, he is a little worse than a man, and when he is worst, he is little better than a beast. And the worst fall that ever fell, I hope I shall make shift to go without him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NER.</speaker>
<line>If he should offer to choose, and choose the right casket, you should refuse to perform your father&#8217;s will, if you should refuse to accept him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POR.</speaker>
<line>Therefore for fear of the worst, I pray thee set a deep glass of Rhenish wine on the contrary casket, for if the devil be within, and that temptation without, I know he will choose it. I will do any thing, Nerissa, ere I will be married to a spunge.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NER.</speaker>
<line>You need not fear, lady, the having any of these lords. They have acquainted me with their determinations, which is indeed to return to their home, and to trouble you with no more suit, unless you may be won by some other sort than your father&#8217;s imposition depending on the caskets.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POR.</speaker>
<line>If I live to be as old as Sibylla, I will die as chaste as Diana, unless I be obtain&#8217;d by the manner of my father&#8217;s will. I am glad this parcel of wooers are so reasonable, for there is not one among them but I dote on his very absence, and I pray God grant them a fair departure.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NER.</speaker>
<line>Do you not remember, lady, in your father&#8217;s time, a Venetian, a scholar and a soldier, that came hither in company of the Marquis of Montferrat?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POR.</speaker>
<line>Yes, yes, it was Bassanio&#8212;as I think, so was he call&#8217;d.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NER.</speaker>
<line>True, madam; he, of all the men that ever my foolish eyes look&#8217;d upon, was the best deserving a fair lady.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POR.</speaker>
<line>I remember him well, and I remember him worthy of thy praise.</line>

<stagedir>Enter a Servingman.</stagedir>
<line>How now, what news?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SERV.</speaker>
<line>The four strangers seek for you, madam, to take their leave; and there is a forerunner come from a fift, the Prince of Morocco, who brings word the Prince his master will be here tonight.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POR.</speaker>
<line>If I could bid the fift welcome with so good heart as I can bid the other four farewell, I should be glad of his approach. If he have the condition of a saint, and the complexion of a devil, I had rather he should shrive me than wive me.</line>
<line>Come, Nerissa. Sirrah, go before.</line>
<line>Whiles we shut the gate upon one wooer, another knocks at the door.</line>

<stagedir>Enter Bassanio with Shylock the Jew.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>SHY.</speaker>
<line>Three thousand ducats, well.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BASS.</speaker>
<line>Ay, sir, for three months.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SHY.</speaker>
<line>For three months, well.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BASS.</speaker>
<line>For the which, as I told you, Antonio shall be bound.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SHY.</speaker>
<line>Antonio shall become bound, well.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BASS.</speaker>
<line>May you stead me? Will you pleasure me? Shall I know your answer?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SHY.</speaker>
<line>Three thousand ducats for three months, and Antonio bound.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BASS.</speaker>
<line>Your answer to that.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SHY.</speaker>
<line>Antonio is a good man.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BASS.</speaker>
<line>Have you heard any imputation to the contrary?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SHY.</speaker>
<line>Ho, no, no, no, no! My meaning in saying he is a good man is to have you understand me that he is sufficient. Yet his means are in supposition: he hath an argosy bound to Tripolis, another to the Indies; I understand moreover upon the Rialto, he hath a third at Mexico, a fourth for England, and other ventures he hath, squand&#8217;red abroad. But ships are but boards, sailors but men; there be land-rats and water-rats, water-thieves and land-thieves, I mean pirates, and then there is the peril of waters, winds, and rocks. The man is notwithstanding sufficient. Three thousand ducats; I think I may take his bond.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BASS.</speaker>
<line>Be assur&#8217;d you may.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SHY.</speaker>
<line>I will be assur&#8217;d I may; and that I may be assur&#8217;d, I will bethink me. May I speak with Antonio?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BASS.</speaker>
<line>If it please you to dine with us.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SHY.</speaker>
<line>Yes, to smell pork, to eat of the habitation which your prophet the Nazarite conjur&#8217;d the devil into. I will buy with you, sell with you, talk with you, walk with you, and so following; but I will not eat with you, drink with you, nor pray with you. What news on the Rialto? Who is he comes here?</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Antonio.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>BASS.</speaker>
<line>This is Signior Antonio.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SHY.</speaker>
<stagedir>Aside.</stagedir>
<line>How like a fawning publican he looks!</line>
<line>I hate him for he is a Christian;</line>
<line>But more, for that in low simplicity</line>
<line>He lends out money gratis, and brings down</line>
<line>The rate of usance here with us in Venice.</line>
<line>If I can catch him once upon the hip,</line>
<line>I will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear him.</line>
<line>He hates our sacred nation, and he rails</line>
<line>Even there where merchants most do congregate</line>
<line>On me, my bargains, and my well-won thrift,</line>
<line>Which he calls interest. Cursed be my tribe</line>
<line>If I forgive him!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BASS.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Shylock, do you hear?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SHY.</speaker>
<line>I am debating of my present store,</line>
<line>And by the near guess of my memory,</line>
<line>I cannot instantly raise up the gross</line>
<line>Of full three thousand ducats. What of that?</line>
<line>Tubal, a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe,</line>
<line>Will furnish me. But soft, how many months</line>
<line>Do you desire?</line>

<stagedir>To Antonio.</stagedir>
<line>Rest you fair, good signior,</line>
<line>Your worship was the last man in our mouths.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANT.</speaker>
<line>Shylock, albeit I neither lend nor borrow</line>
<line>By taking nor by giving of excess,</line>
<line>Yet to supply the ripe wants of my friend,</line>

<line>I had forgot&#8212;three months&#8212;</line>

<line offset="7">you told me so.</line>

<line>When Jacob graz&#8217;d his uncle Laban&#8217;s sheep&#8212;</line>
<line>This Jacob from our holy Abram was</line>
<line>(As his wise mother wrought in his behalf)</line>
<line>The third possessor; ay, he was the third&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANT.</speaker>
<line>And what of him? Did he take interest?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SHY.</speaker>
<line>No, not take interest, not as you would say</line>
<line>Directly int&#8217;rest. Mark what Jacob did:</line>
<line>When Laban and himself were compremis&#8217;d</line>
<line>That all the eanlings which were streak&#8217;d and pied</line>
<line>Should fall as Jacob&#8217;s hire, the ewes being rank</line>
<line>In end of autumn turned to the rams,</line>
<line>And when the work of generation was</line>
<line>Between these woolly breeders in the act,</line>
<line>The skillful shepherd pill&#8217;d me certain wands,</line>
<line>And in the doing of the deed of kind,</line>
<line>He stuck them up before the fulsome ewes,</line>
<line>Who then conceiving did in eaning time</line>
<line>Fall parti-color&#8217;d lambs, and those were Jacob&#8217;s.</line>
<line>This was a way to thrive, and he was blest;</line>
<line>And thrift is blessing, if men steal it not.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANT.</speaker>
<line>This was a venture, sir, that Jacob serv&#8217;d for,</line>
<line>A thing not in his power to bring to pass,</line>
<line>But sway&#8217;d and fashion&#8217;d by the hand of heaven.</line>
<line>Was this inserted to make interest good?</line>
<line>Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams?</line>

<speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANT.</speaker>
<line>Well, Shylock, shall we be beholding to you?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SHY.</speaker>
<line>Signior Antonio, many a time and oft</line>
<line>In the Rialto you have rated me</line>
<line>About my moneys and my usances.</line>
<line>Still have I borne it with a patient shrug</line>
<line>(For suff&#8217;rance is the badge of all our tribe).</line>
<line>You call me misbeliever, cut-throat dog,</line>
<line>And spet upon my Jewish gaberdine,</line>
<line>And all for use of that which is mine own.</line>
<line>Well then, it now appears you need my help.</line>
<line>Go to then, you come to me, and you say,</line>
<line>&#8220;Shylock, we would have moneys,&#8221; you say so&#8212;</line>
<line>You, that did void your rheum upon my beard,</line>
<line>And foot me as you spurn a stranger cur</line>
<line>Over your threshold; moneys is your suit.</line>
<line>What should I say to you? Should I not say,</line>
<line>&#8220;Hath a dog money? Is it possible</line>
<line>A cur can lend three thousand ducats?&#8221; Or</line>
<line>Shall I bend low and in a bondman&#8217;s key,</line>
<line>With bated breath and whisp&#8217;ring humbleness,</line>
<line>Say this:</line>
<line>&#8220;Fair sir, you spet on me on Wednesday last,</line>
<line>You spurn&#8217;d me such a day, another time</line>
<line>You call&#8217;d me dog; and for these courtesies</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll lend you thus much moneys&#8221;?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANT.</speaker>
<line>I am as like to call thee so again,</line>
<line>To spet on thee again, to spurn thee too.</line>
<line>If thou wilt lend this money, lend it not</line>
<line>As to thy friends, for when did friendship take</line>
<line>A breed for barren metal of his friend?</line>
<line>But lend it rather to thine enemy,</line>
<line>Who if he break, thou mayst with better face</line>
<line>Exact the penalty.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SHY.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Why, look you how you storm!</line>
<line>I would be friends with you, and have your love,</line>
<line>Forget the shames that you have stain&#8217;d me with,</line>

<line>If you repay me not on such a day,</line>
<line>In such a place, such sum or sums as are</line>
<line>Express&#8217;d in the condition, let the forfeit</line>
<line>Be nominated for an equal pound</line>

<line>In what part of your body pleaseth me.</line>

<speech>

<line>Content, in faith, I&#8217;ll seal to such a bond,</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BASS.</speaker>
<line>You shall not seal to such a bond for me,</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll rather dwell in my necessity.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>ANT.</speaker>
<line>Why, fear not, man, I will not forfeit it.</line>
<line>Within these two months, that&#8217;s a month before</line>
<line>This bond expires, I do expect return</line>

<line>O father Abram, what these Christians are,</line>
<line>Whose own hard dealings teaches them suspect</line>
<line>The thoughts of others! Pray you tell me this:</line>
<line>If he should break his day, what should I gain</line>
<line>By the exaction of the forfeiture?</line>
<line>A pound of man&#8217;s flesh taken from a man</line>
<line>Is not so estimable, profitable neither,</line>
<line>As flesh of muttons, beefs, or goats. I say,</line>
<line>To buy his favor, I extend this friendship.</line>
<line>If he will take it, so, if not, <french xml:lang="fr">adieu</french>;</line>
<line>And for my love I pray you wrong me not.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANT.</speaker>
<line>Yes, Shylock, I will seal unto this bond.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SHY.</speaker>
<line>Then meet me forthwith at the notary&#8217;s;</line>
<line>Give him direction for this merry bond,</line>
<line>And I will go and purse the ducats straight,</line>
<line>See to my house, left in the fearful guard</line>

<stagedir>Enter the Clown Launcelot Gobbo alone.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>LAUN.</speaker>
<line>Certainly my conscience will serve me to run from this Jew my master. The fiend is at mine elbow and tempts me, saying to me, &#8220;Gobbo, Launcelot Gobbo, good Launcelot,&#8221; or &#8220;good Gobbo,&#8221; or &#8220;good Launcelot Gobbo, use your legs, take the start, run away.&#8221; My conscience says, &#8220;No; take heed, honest Launcelot, take heed, honest Gobbo,&#8221; or as aforesaid, &#8220;honest Launcelot Gobbo, do not run, scorn running with thy heels.&#8221; Well, the most courageous fiend bids me pack. &#8220;Fia!&#8221; says the fiend; &#8220;away!&#8221; says the fiend; &#8220;for the heavens, rouse up a brave mind,&#8221; says the fiend, &#8220;and run.&#8221; Well, my conscience, hanging about the neck of my heart, says very wisely to me, &#8220;My honest friend Launcelot, being an honest man&#8217;s son&#8221;&#8212;or rather an honest woman&#8217;s son, for indeed my father did something smack, something grow to, he had a kind of taste&#8212;well, my conscience says, &#8220;Launcelot, bouge not.&#8221; &#8220;Bouge,&#8221; says the fiend. &#8220;Bouge not,&#8221; says my conscience. &#8220;Conscience,&#8221; say I, &#8220;you counsel well.&#8221; &#8220;Fiend,&#8221; say I, &#8220;you counsel well.&#8221; To be rul&#8217;d by my conscience, I should stay with the Jew my master, who (God bless the mark) is a kind of devil; and to run away from the Jew, I should be rul&#8217;d by the fiend, who, saving your reverence, is the devil himself. Certainly the Jew is the very devil incarnation, and in my conscience, my conscience is but a kind of hard conscience, to offer to counsel me to stay with the Jew. The fiend gives the more friendly counsel: I will run, fiend; my heels are at your commandment, I will run.</line>

<stagedir>Enter Old Gobbo with a basket.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>GOB.</speaker>
<line>Master young man, you, I pray you, which is the way to Master Jew&#8217;s?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LAUN.</speaker>
<stagedir>Aside.</stagedir><line> O heavens, this is my true-begotten father, who being more than sand-blind, high gravel-blind, knows me not. I will try confusions with him.</line>

<speaker>GOB.</speaker>
<line>Master young gentleman, I pray you, which is the way to Master Jew&#8217;s?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LAUN.</speaker>
<line>Turn up on your right hand at the next turning, but at the next turning of all, on your left; marry, at the very next turning, turn of no hand, but turn down indirectly to the Jew&#8217;s house.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GOB.</speaker>
<line>Be God&#8217;s sonties, &#8217;twill be a hard way to hit. Can you tell me whether one Launcelot, that dwells with him, dwell with him or no?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LAUN.</speaker>
<line>Talk you of young Master Launcelot?</line>
<stagedir>Aside.</stagedir>
<line>Mark me now, now will I raise the waters.&#8212;Talk you of young Master Launcelot?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GOB.</speaker>
<line>No master, sir, but a poor man&#8217;s son. His father, though I say&#8217;t, is an honest exceeding poor man and, God be thank&#8217;d, well to live.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LAUN.</speaker>
<line>Well, let his father be what &#8217;a will, we talk of young Master Launcelot.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>GOB.</speaker>
<line>Your worship&#8217;s friend and Launcelot, sir.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LAUN.</speaker>
<line>But I pray you, ergo, old man, ergo, I beseech you, talk you of young Master Launcelot.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>GOB.</speaker>
<line>Of Launcelot, an&#8217;t please your mastership.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LAUN.</speaker>
<line>Ergo, Master Launcelot. Talk not of Master Launcelot, father, for the young gentleman, according to Fates and Destinies, and such odd sayings, the Sisters Three, and such branches of learning, is indeed deceas&#8217;d, or as you would say in plain terms, gone to heaven.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GOB.</speaker>
<line>Marry, God forbid, the boy was the very staff of my age, my very prop.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LAUN.</speaker>
<stagedir>Aside.</stagedir>
<line>Do I look like a cudgel or a hovel-post, a staff, or a prop?&#8212;Do you know me, father?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GOB.</speaker>
<line>Alack the day, I know you not, young gentleman, but I pray you tell me, is my boy, God rest his soul, alive or dead?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LAUN.</speaker>
<line>Do you not know me, father?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GOB.</speaker>
<line>Alack, sir, I am sand-blind, I know you not.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LAUN.</speaker>
<line>Nay, indeed if you had your eyes you might fail of the knowing me; it is a wise father that knows his own child. Well, old man, I will tell you news of your son. Give me your blessing; truth will come to light; murder cannot be hid long; a man&#8217;s son may, but in the end truth will out.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GOB.</speaker>
<line>Pray you, sir, stand up. I am sure you are not Launcelot, my boy.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LAUN.</speaker>
<line>Pray you let&#8217;s have no more fooling about it, but give me your blessing. I am Launcelot, your boy that was, your son that is, your child that shall be.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GOB.</speaker>
<line>I cannot think you are my son.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LAUN.</speaker>
<line>I know not what I shall think of that; but I am Launcelot, the Jew&#8217;s man, and I am sure Margery your wife is my mother.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GOB.</speaker>
<line>Her name is Margery indeed. I&#8217;ll be sworn, if thou be Launcelot, thou art mine own flesh and blood. Lord worshipp&#8217;d might he be, what a beard hast thou got! Thou hast got more hair on thy chin than Dobbin my fill-horse has on his tail.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LAUN.</speaker>
<line>It should seem then that Dobbin&#8217;s tail grows backward. I am sure he had more hair of his tail than I have of my face when I last saw him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GOB.</speaker>
<line>Lord, how art thou chang&#8217;d! How dost thou and thy master agree? I have brought him a present. How &#8217;gree you now?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LAUN.</speaker>
<line>Well, well; but for mine own part, as I have set up my rest to run away, so I will not rest till I have run some ground. My master&#8217;s a very Jew. Give him a present! Give him a halter. I am famish&#8217;d in his service; you may tell every finger I have with my ribs. Father, I am glad you are come; give me your present to one Master Bassanio, who indeed gives rare new liveries. If I serve not him, I will run as far as God has any ground. O rare fortune, here comes the man. To him, father, for I am a Jew if I serve the Jew any longer.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Bassanio with a follower or two, one of them Leonardo.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>BASS.</speaker>
<line>You may do so, but let it be so hasted that supper be ready at the farthest by five of the clock. See these letters deliver&#8217;d, put the liveries to making, and desire Gratiano to come anon to my lodging.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>BASS.</speaker>
<line>Gramercy, wouldst thou aught with me?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GOB.</speaker>
<line>Here&#8217;s my son, sir, a poor boy&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LAUN.</speaker>
<line>Not a poor boy, sir, but the rich Jew&#8217;s man, that would, sir, as my father shall specify&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GOB.</speaker>
<line>He hath a great infection, sir, as one would say, to serve&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LAUN.</speaker>
<line>Indeed the short and the long is, I serve the Jew, and have a desire, as my father shall specify&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GOB.</speaker>
<line>His master and he (saving your worship&#8217;s reverence) are scarce cater-cousins&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LAUN.</speaker>
<line>To be brief, the very truth is that the Jew, having done me wrong, doth cause me, as my father, being I hope an old man, shall frutify unto you&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GOB.</speaker>
<line>I have here a dish of doves that I would bestow upon your worship, and my suit is&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LAUN.</speaker>
<line>In very brief, the suit is impertinent to myself, as your worship shall know by this honest old man, and though I say it, though old man, yet poor man, my father.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BASS.</speaker>
<line>One speak for both. What would you?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LAUN.</speaker>
<line>Serve you, sir.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GOB.</speaker>
<line>That is the very defect of the matter, sir.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BASS.</speaker>
<line>I know thee well, thou hast obtain&#8217;d thy suit.</line>
<line>Shylock thy master spoke with me this day,</line>
<line>And hath preferr&#8217;d thee, if it be preferment</line>
<line>To leave a rich Jew&#8217;s service, to become</line>
<line>The follower of so poor a gentleman.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LAUN.</speaker>
<line>The old proverb is very well parted between my master Shylock and you, sir: you have the grace of God, sir, and he hath enough.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BASS.</speaker>
<line>Thou speak&#8217;st it well. Go, father, with thy son.</line>
<line>Take leave of thy old master, and inquire</line>
<line>My lodging out.&#8212;Give him a livery</line>
<line>More guarded than his fellows&#8217;; see it done.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LAUN.</speaker>
<line>Father, in. I cannot get a service, no, I have ne&#8217;er a tongue in my head, well!</line>
<stagedir>Looking on his palm.</stagedir>
<line>If any man in Italy have a fairer table, which doth offer to swear upon a book, I shall have good fortune. Go to, here&#8217;s a simple line of life! Here&#8217;s a small trifle of wives! Alas, fifteen wives is nothing! Aleven widows and nine maids is a simple coming-in for one man. And then to scape drowning thrice, and to be in peril of my life with the edge of a feather-bed, here are simple scapes. Well, if Fortune be a woman, she&#8217;s a good wench for this gear. Father, come, I&#8217;ll take my leave of the Jew in the twinkling.</line>

<line>Parts that become thee happily enough,</line>
<line>And in such eyes as ours appear not faults,</line>
<line>But where thou art not known, why, there they show</line>

<line>Clamber not you up to the casements then,</line>
<line>Nor thrust your head into the public street</line>
<line>To gaze on Christian fools with varnish&#8217;d faces;</line>
<line>But stop my house&#8217;s ears, I mean my casements;</line>
<line>Let not the sound of shallow fopp&#8217;ry enter</line>

<line>I am glad &#8217;tis night, you do not look on me,</line>
<line>For I am much asham&#8217;d of my exchange.</line>
<line>But love is blind, and lovers cannot see</line>
<line>The pretty follies that themselves commit,</line>

<line>This first, of gold, who this inscription bears,</line>
<line>&#8220;Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire&#8221;;</line>
<line>The second, silver, which this promise carries,</line>
<line>&#8220;Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves&#8221;;</line>
<line>This third, dull lead, with warning all as blunt,</line>
<line>&#8220;Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.&#8221;</line>
<line>How shall I know if I do choose the right?</line>

<speech>
<speaker>MOR.</speaker>
<line>Some god direct my judgment! Let me see,</line>
<line>I will survey th&#8217; inscriptions back again.</line>
<line>What says this leaden casket?</line>
<line>&#8220;Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.&#8221;</line>
<line>Must give&#8212;for what? For lead, hazard for lead?</line>
<line>This casket threatens. Men that hazard all</line>
<line>Do it in hope of fair advantages;</line>
<line>A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross.</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll then nor give nor hazard aught for lead.</line>
<line>What says the silver with her virgin hue?</line>
<line>&#8220;Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.&#8221;</line>
<line>As much as he deserves! Pause there, Morocco,</line>
<line>And weigh thy value with an even hand.</line>
<line>If thou beest rated by thy estimation,</line>
<line>Thou dost deserve enough, and yet enough</line>
<line>May not extend so far as to the lady;</line>
<line>And yet to be afeard of my deserving</line>
<line>Were but a weak disabling of myself.</line>
<line>As much as I deserve! Why, that&#8217;s the lady.</line>
<line>I do in birth deserve her, and in fortunes,</line>
<line>In graces, and in qualities of breeding;</line>
<line>But more than these, in love I do deserve.</line>
<line>What if I stray&#8217;d no farther, but chose here?</line>
<line>Let&#8217;s see once more this saying grav&#8217;d in gold:</line>
<line>&#8220;Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.&#8221;</line>
<line>Why, that&#8217;s the lady, all the world desires her.</line>
<line>From the four corners of the earth they come</line>
<line>To kiss this shrine, this mortal breathing saint.</line>
<line>The Hyrcanian deserts and the vasty wilds</line>
<line>Of wide Arabia are as throughfares now</line>
<line>For princes to come view fair Portia.</line>
<line>The watery kingdom, whose ambitious head</line>
<line>Spets in the face of heaven, is no bar</line>
<line>To stop the foreign spirits, but they come</line>
<line>As o&#8217;er a brook to see fair Portia.</line>
<line>One of these three contains her heavenly picture.</line>
<line>Is&#8217;t like that lead contains her? &#8217;Twere damnation</line>
<line>To think so base a thought; it were too gross</line>
<line>To rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave.</line>
<line>Or shall I think in silver she&#8217;s immur&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Being ten times undervalued to tried gold?</line>
<line>O sinful thought! Never so rich a gem</line>
<line>Was set in worse than gold. They have in England</line>
<line>A coin that bears the figure of an angel</line>
<line>Stamp&#8217;d in gold, but that&#8217;s insculp&#8217;d upon;</line>

<speaker>SOL.</speaker>
<line>The villain Jew with outcries rais&#8217;d the Duke,</line>
<line>Who went with him to search Bassanio&#8217;s ship.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SAL.</speaker>
<line>He came too late, the ship was under sail,</line>
<line>But there the Duke was given to understand</line>
<line>That in a gondilo were seen together</line>
<line>Lorenzo and his amorous Jessica.</line>
<line>Besides, Antonio certified the Duke</line>
<line>They were not with Bassanio in his ship.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SOL.</speaker>
<line>I never heard a passion so confus&#8217;d,</line>

<line>&#8220;My daughter! O my ducats! O my daughter!</line>
<line>Fled with a Christian! O my Christian ducats!</line>

<line>Who told me, in the Narrow Seas that part</line>
<line>The French and English, there miscarried</line>
<line>A vessel of our country richly fraught.</line>
<line>I thought upon Antonio when he told me,</line>

<speaker>SOL.</speaker>
<line>You were best to tell Antonio what you hear,</line>
<line>Yet do not suddenly, for it may grieve him.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>SAL.</speaker>
<line>A kinder gentleman treads not the earth.</line>
<line>I saw Bassanio and Antonio part:</line>
<line>Bassanio told him he would make some speed</line>
<line>Of his return; he answered, &#8220;Do not so,</line>
<line>Slubber not business for my sake, Bassanio,</line>
<line>But stay the very riping of the time;</line>
<line>And for the Jew&#8217;s bond which he hath of me,</line>
<line>Let it not enter in your mind of love.</line>
<line>Be merry, and employ your chiefest thoughts</line>
<line>To courtship, and such fair ostents of love</line>
<line>As shall conveniently become you there.&#8221;</line>
<line>And even there, his eye being big with tears,</line>
<line>Turning his face, he put his hand behind him,</line>
<line>And with affection wondrous sensible</line>
<line>He wrung Bassanio&#8217;s hand, and so they parted.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SOL.</speaker>
<line>I think he only loves the world for him.</line>
<line>I pray thee let us go and find him out</line>

<line>Now what news on the Rialto?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SAL.</speaker>
<line>Why, yet it lives there uncheck&#8217;d that Antonio hath a ship of rich lading wrack&#8217;d on the Narrow Seas; the Goodwins I think they call the place, a very dangerous flat, and fatal, where the carcasses of many a tall ship lie buried, as they say, if my gossip Report be an honest woman of her word.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SOL.</speaker>
<line>I would she were as lying a gossip in that as ever knapp&#8217;d ginger or made her neighbors believe she wept for the death of a third husband. But it is true, without any slips of prolixity, or crossing the plain highway of talk, that the good Antonio, the honest Antonio&#8212;O that I had a title good enough to keep his name company!&#8212;</line>

<line>Ha, what sayest thou? Why, the end is, he hath lost a ship.</line>

<stagedir>Enter Shylock.</stagedir>
<line>How now, Shylock, what news among the merchants?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SHY.</speaker>
<line>You knew, none so well, none so well as you, of my daughter&#8217;s flight.</line>
</speech>

<speaker>SAL.</speaker>
<line>That&#8217;s certain. I for my part knew the tailor that made the wings she flew withal.</line>

<line>She is damn&#8217;d for it.</line>

<speaker>SOL.</speaker>
<line>Out upon it, old carrion, rebels it at these years?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SHY.</speaker>
<line>I say, my daughter is my flesh and my blood.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SAL.</speaker>
<line>There is more difference between thy flesh and hers than between jet and ivory, more between your bloods than there is between red wine and Rhenish. But tell us, do you hear whether Antonio have had any loss at sea or no?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SHY.</speaker>
<line>There I have another bad match. A bank-rout, a prodigal, who dare scarce show his head on the Rialto; a beggar, that was us&#8217;d to come so smug upon the mart: let him look to his bond. He was wont to call me usurer, let him look to his bond. He was wont to lend money for a Christian cur&#8217;sy, let him look to his bond.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SAL.</speaker>
<line>Why, I am sure if he forfeit thou wilt not take his flesh. What&#8217;s that good for?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SHY.</speaker>
<line>To bait fish withal&#8212;if it will feed nothing else, it will feed my revenge. He hath disgrac&#8217;d me, and hind&#8217;red me half a million, laugh&#8217;d at my losses, mock&#8217;d at my gains, scorn&#8217;d my nation, thwarted my bargains, cool&#8217;d my friends, heated mine enemies; and what&#8217;s his reason? I am a Jew. Hath not a Jew eyes? Hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passions; fed with the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject to the same diseases, heal&#8217;d by the same means, warm&#8217;d and cool&#8217;d by the same winter and summer, as a Christian is? If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die? And if you wrong us, shall we not revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we will resemble you in that. If a Jew wrong a Christian, what is his humility? Revenge. If a Christian wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance be by Christian example? Why, revenge. The villainy you teach me, I will execute, and it shall go hard but I will better the instruction.</line>

<line>Why, there, there, there, there! A diamond gone, cost me two thousand ducats in Frankford! The curse never fell upon our nation till now, I never felt it till now. Two thousand ducats in that, and other precious, precious jewels. I would my daughter were dead at my foot, and the jewels in her ear! Would she were hears&#8217;d at my foot, and the ducats in her coffin! No news of them? Why, so&#8212;and I know not what&#8217;s spent in the search. Why, thou loss upon loss! The thief gone with so much, and so much to find the thief, and no satisfaction, no revenge, nor no ill luck stirring but what lights a&#8217; my shoulders, no sighs but a&#8217; my breathing, no tears but a&#8217; my shedding.</line>

<line>There came divers of Antonio&#8217;s creditors in my company to Venice that swear he cannot choose but break.</line>

<line>One of them show&#8217;d me a ring that he had of your daughter for a monkey.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SHY.</speaker>
<line>Out upon her! Thou torturest me, Tubal. It was my turkis, I had it of Leah when I was a bachelor. I would not have given it for a wilderness of monkeys.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TUB.</speaker>
<line>But Antonio is certainly undone.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SHY.</speaker>
<line>Nay, that&#8217;s true, that&#8217;s very true. Go, Tubal, fee me an officer; bespeak him a fortnight before. I will have the heart of him if he forfeit, for were he out of Venice I can make what merchandise I will. Go, Tubal, and meet me at our synagogue; go, good Tubal, at our synagogue, Tubal.</line>

<line>So may the outward shows be least themselves&#8212;</line>
<line>The world is still deceiv&#8217;d with ornament.</line>
<line>In law, what plea so tainted and corrupt</line>
<line>But, being season&#8217;d with a gracious voice,</line>
<line>Obscures the show of evil? In religion,</line>
<line>What damned error but some sober brow</line>
<line>Will bless it, and approve it with a text,</line>
<line>Hiding the grossness with fair ornament?</line>
<line>There is no vice so simple but assumes</line>
<line>Some mark of virtue on his outward parts.</line>
<line>How many cowards, whose hearts are all as false</line>
<line>As stairs of sand, wear yet upon their chins</line>
<line>The beards of Hercules and frowning Mars,</line>
<line>Who inward search&#8217;d, have livers white as milk,</line>
<line>And these assume but valor&#8217;s excrement</line>
<line>To render them redoubted! Look on beauty,</line>
<line>And you shall see &#8217;tis purchas&#8217;d by the weight,</line>
<line>Which therein works a miracle in nature,</line>
<line>Making them lightest that wear most of it.</line>
<line>So are those crisped snaky golden locks,</line>
<line>Which make such wanton gambols with the wind</line>
<line>Upon supposed fairness, often known</line>
<line>To be the dowry of a second head,</line>
<line>The skull that bred them in the sepulchre.</line>
<line>Thus ornament is but the guiled shore</line>
<line>To a most dangerous sea; the beauteous scarf</line>
<line>Veiling an Indian beauty; in a word,</line>
<line>The seeming truth which cunning times put on</line>
<line>To entrap the wisest. Therefore then, thou gaudy gold,</line>
<line>Hard food for Midas, I will none of thee;</line>
<line>Nor none of thee, thou pale and common drudge</line>
<line>&#8217;Tween man and man; but thou, thou meagre lead,</line>

<line>I would be trebled twenty times myself,</line>
<line>A thousand times more fair, ten thousand times more rich,</line>
<line>That only to stand high in your account,</line>
<line>I might in virtues, beauties, livings, friends,</line>
<line>Exceed account. But the full sum of me</line>
<line>Is sum of something; which, to term in gross,</line>

<line>Happy in this, she is not yet so old</line>

<line offset="7">O sweet Portia,</line>
<line>Here are a few of the unpleasant&#8217;st words</line>

<line>When I did first impart my love to you,</line>
<line>I freely told you all the wealth I had</line>
<line>Ran in my veins: I was a gentleman;</line>
<line>And then I told you true. And yet, dear lady,</line>
<line>Rating myself at nothing, you shall see</line>
<line>How much I was a braggart: when I told you</line>
<line>My state was nothing, I should then have told you</line>
<line>That I was worse than nothing; for indeed</line>
<line>I have engag&#8217;d myself to a dear friend,</line>
<line>Engag&#8217;d my friend to his mere enemy,</line>
<line>To feed my means. Here is a letter, lady,</line>
<line>The paper as the body of my friend,</line>
<line>And every word in it a gaping wound</line>
<line>Issuing life-blood. But is it true, Salerio?</line>
<line>Hath all his ventures fail&#8217;d? What, not one hit?</line>
<line>From Tripolis, from Mexico, and England,</line>
<line>From Lisbon, Barbary, and India,</line>

<line offset="6">Not one, my lord.</line>

<line>A creature that did bear the shape of man</line>
<line>So keen and greedy to confound a man.</line>
<line>He plies the Duke at morning and at night,</line>
<line>And doth impeach the freedom of the state,</line>
<line>If they deny him justice. Twenty merchants,</line>
<line>The Duke himself, and the magnificoes</line>
<line>Of greatest port, have all persuaded with him,</line>
<line>But none can drive him from the envious plea</line>
<line>Of forfeiture, of justice, and his bond.</line>

<line>When I was with him I have heard him swear</line>

<line>When we are both accoutered like young men,</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll prove the prettier fellow of the two,</line>
<line>And wear my dagger with the braver grace,</line>
<line>And speak between the change of man and boy</line>
<line>With a reed voice, and turn two mincing steps</line>
<line>Into a manly stride; and speak of frays</line>
<line>Like a fine bragging youth, and tell quaint lies,</line>
<line>How honorable ladies sought my love,</line>
<line>Which I denying, they fell sick and died.</line>
<line>I could not do withal. Then I&#8217;ll repent,</line>
<line>And wish, for all that, that I had not kill&#8217;d them;</line>
<line>And twenty of these puny lies I&#8217;ll tell,</line>

<speech>
<speaker>LAUN.</speaker>
<line>Yes, truly, for look you, the sins of the father are to be laid upon the children; therefore, I promise you, I fear you. I was always plain with you, and so now I speak my agitation of the matter; therefore be a&#8217; good cheer, for truly I think you are damn&#8217;d. There is but one hope in it that can do you any good, and that is but a kind of bastard hope neither.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JES.</speaker>
<line>And what hope is that, I pray thee?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LAUN.</speaker>
<line>Marry, you may partly hope that your father got you not, that you are not the Jew&#8217;s daughter.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JES.</speaker>
<line>That were a kind of bastard hope indeed; so the sins of my mother should be visited upon me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LAUN.</speaker>
<line>Truly then I fear you are damn&#8217;d both by father and mother; thus when I shun Scylla, your father, I fall into Charybdis, your mother. Well, you are gone both ways.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JES.</speaker>
<line>I shall be sav&#8217;d by my husband, he hath made me a Christian!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LAUN.</speaker>
<line>Truly, the more to blame he; we were Christians enow before, e&#8217;en as many as could well live one by another. This making of Christians will raise the price of hogs. If we grow all to be pork-eaters, we shall not shortly have a rasher on the coals for money.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Lorenzo.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>JES.</speaker>
<line>I&#8217;ll tell my husband, Launcelot, what you say. Here he comes.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>LOR.</speaker>
<line>I shall grow jealious of you shortly, Launcelot, if you thus get my wife into corners!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JES.</speaker>
<line>Nay, you need not fear us, Lorenzo, Launcelot and I are out. He tells me flatly there&#8217;s no mercy for me in heaven because I am a Jew&#8217;s daughter; and he says you are no good member of the commonwealth, for in converting Jews to Christians, you raise the price of pork.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LOR.</speaker>
<line>I shall answer that better to the commonwealth than you can the getting up of the Negro&#8217;s belly; the Moor is with child by you, Launcelot.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LAUN.</speaker>
<line>It is much that the Moor should be more than reason; but if she be less than an honest woman, she is indeed more than I took her for.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LOR.</speaker>
<line>How every fool can play upon the word! I think the best grace of wit will shortly turn into silence, and discourse grow commendable in none only but parrots. Go in, sirrah, bid them prepare for dinner.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LAUN.</speaker>
<line>That is done, sir, they have all stomachs!</line>

<line>Goodly Lord, what a wit-snapper are you! Then bid them prepare dinner.</line>
</speech>

<speech>

<line>Yet more quarrelling with occasion! Wilt thou show the whole wealth of thy wit in an instant? I pray thee understand a plain man in his plain meaning: go to thy fellows, bid them cover the table, serve in the meat, and we will come in to dinner.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LAUN.</speaker>
<line>For the table, sir, it shall be serv&#8217;d in; for the meat, sir, it shall be cover&#8217;d; for your coming in to dinner, sir, why, let it be as humors and conceits shall govern.</line>

<line>The Lord Bassanio live an upright life,</line>
<line>For having such a blessing in his lady,</line>
<line>He finds the joys of heaven here on earth,</line>
<line>And if on earth he do not merit it,</line>
<line>In reason he should never come to heaven!</line>
<line>Why, if two gods should play some heavenly match,</line>
<line>And on the wager lay two earthly women,</line>
<line>And Portia one, there must be something else</line>

<speech>
<speaker>ANT.</speaker>
<line offset="5">I have heard</line>

<stagedir>Enter Shylock.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
<line>Make room, and let him stand before our face.</line>
<line>Shylock, the world thinks, and I think so too,</line>
<line>That thou but leadest this fashion of thy malice</line>
<line>To the last hour of act, and then &#8217;tis thought</line>
<line>Thou&#8217;lt show thy mercy and remorse more strange</line>
<line>Than is thy strange apparent cruelty;</line>
<line>And where thou now exacts the penalty,</line>
<line>Which is a pound of this poor merchant&#8217;s flesh,</line>
<line>Thou wilt not only loose the forfeiture,</line>
<line>But touch&#8217;d with humane gentleness and love,</line>
<line>Forgive a moi&#8217;ty of the principal,</line>
<line>Glancing an eye of pity on his losses,</line>
<line>That have of late so huddled on his back,</line>
<line>Enow to press a royal merchant down,</line>
<line>And pluck commiseration of his state</line>
<line>From brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flints,</line>
<line>From stubborn Turks, and Tartars never train&#8217;d</line>
<line>To offices of tender courtesy.</line>
<line>We all expect a gentle answer, Jew!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SHY.</speaker>
<line>I have possess&#8217;d your Grace of what I purpose,</line>
<line>And by our holy Sabaoth have I sworn</line>
<line>To have the due and forfeit of my bond.</line>
<line>If you deny it, let the danger light</line>
<line>Upon your charter and your city&#8217;s freedom!</line>
<line>You&#8217;ll ask me why I rather choose to have</line>
<line>A weight of carrion flesh than to receive</line>
<line>Three thousand ducats. I&#8217;ll not answer that;</line>
<line>But say it is my humor, is it answer&#8217;d?</line>
<line>What if my house be troubled with a rat,</line>
<line>And I be pleas&#8217;d to give ten thousand ducats</line>
<line>To have it ban&#8217;d? What, are you answer&#8217;d yet?</line>
<line>Some men there are love not a gaping pig;</line>
<line>Some that are mad if they behold a cat;</line>
<line>And others, when the bagpipe sings i&#8217; th&#8217; nose,</line>
<line>Cannot contain their urine: for affection,</line>
<line>Mistress of passion, sways it to the mood</line>
<line>Of what it likes or loathes. Now for your answer:</line>
<line>As there is no firm reason to be rend&#8217;red</line>
<line>Why he cannot abide a gaping pig;</line>
<line>Why he, a harmless necessary cat;</line>
<line>Why he, a woollen bagpipe, but of force</line>
<line>Must yield to such inevitable shame</line>
<line>As to offend, himself being offended;</line>
<line>So can I give no reason, nor I will not,</line>
<line>More than a lodg&#8217;d hate and a certain loathing</line>
<line>I bear Antonio, that I follow thus</line>
<line>A losing suit against him. Are you answered?</line>

<speech>
<speaker>BASS.</speaker>
<line>This is no answer, thou unfeeling man,</line>

<speaker>ANT.</speaker>
<line>I pray you think you question with the Jew:</line>
<line>You may as well go stand upon the beach</line>
<line>And bid the main flood bate his usual height;</line>
<line>You may as well use question with the wolf</line>
<line>Why he hath made the ewe bleak for the lamb;</line>
<line>You may as well forbid the mountain pines</line>
<line>To wag their high tops, and to make no noise</line>
<line>When they are fretten with the gusts of heaven;</line>
<line>You may as well do any thing most hard</line>
<line>As seek to soften that&#8212;than which what&#8217;s harder?&#8212;</line>
<line>His Jewish heart! Therefore I do beseech you</line>
<line>Make no more offers, use no farther means,</line>

<line>You have among you many a purchas&#8217;d slave,</line>

<line>Because you bought them. Shall I say to you,</line>
<line>&#8220;Let them be free! Marry them to your heirs!</line>
<line>Why sweat they under burdens? Let their beds</line>
<line>Be made as soft as yours, and let their palates</line>
<line>Be season&#8217;d with such viands&#8221;? You will answer,</line>
<line>&#8220;The slaves are ours.&#8221; So do I answer you:</line>
<line>The pound of flesh which I demand of him</line>
<line>Is dearly bought as mine, and I will have it.</line>
<line>If you deny me, fie upon your law!</line>
<line>There is no force in the decrees of Venice.</line>

<stagedir>Reads.</stagedir>
<line><RECITE>&#8220;Your Grace shall understand that at the receipt of your letter I am very sick, but in the instant that your messenger came, in loving visitation was with me a young doctor of Rome. His name is Balthazar. I acquainted him with the cause in controversy between the Jew and Antonio the merchant. We turn&#8217;d o&#8217;er many books together. He is furnish&#8217;d with my opinion, which better&#8217;d with his own learning, the greatness whereof I cannot enough commend, comes with him, at my importunity, to fill up your Grace&#8217;s request in my stead. I beseech you let his lack of years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend estimation, for I never knew so young a body with so old a head. I leave him to your gracious acceptance, whose trial shall better publish his commendation.&#8221;</RECITE></line>

<speech>
<speaker>SHY.</speaker>
<line>On what compulsion must I? Tell me that.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POR.</speaker>
<line>The quality of mercy is not strain&#8217;d,</line>
<line>It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven</line>
<line>Upon the place beneath. It is twice blest:</line>
<line>It blesseth him that gives and him that takes.</line>
<line>&#8217;Tis mightiest in the mightiest, it becomes</line>
<line>The throned monarch better than his crown.</line>
<line>His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,</line>
<line>The attribute to awe and majesty,</line>
<line>Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;</line>
<line>But mercy is above this sceptred sway,</line>
<line>It is enthroned in the hearts of kings,</line>
<line>It is an attribute to God himself;</line>
<line>And earthly power doth then show likest God&#8217;s</line>
<line>When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,</line>
<line>Though justice be thy plea, consider this,</line>
<line>That in the course of justice, none of us</line>
<line>Should see salvation. We do pray for mercy,</line>
<line>And that same prayer doth teach us all to render</line>
<line>The deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much</line>
<line>To mitigate the justice of thy plea,</line>
<line>Which if thou follow, this strict court of Venice</line>
<line>Must needs give sentence &#8217;gainst the merchant there.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SHY.</speaker>
<line>My deeds upon my head! I crave the law,</line>
<line>The penalty and forfeit of my bond.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>BASS.</speaker>
<line>Yes, here I tender it for him in the court,</line>
<line>Yea, twice the sum. If that will not suffice,</line>
<line>I will be bound to pay it ten times o&#8217;er,</line>
<line>On forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart.</line>

<line>And ceremoniously let us prepare</line>
<line>Some welcome for the mistress of the house.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Clown Launcelot.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>LAUN.</speaker>
<line>Sola, sola! Wo ha, ho! Sola, sola!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LOR.</speaker>
<line>Who calls?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LAUN.</speaker>
<line>Sola! Did you see Master Lorenzo? Master Lorenzo, sola, sola!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LOR.</speaker>
<line>Leave hollowing, man&#8212;here.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LAUN.</speaker>
<line>Sola! Where, where?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LOR.</speaker>
<line>Here!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LAUN.</speaker>
<line>Tell him there&#8217;s a post come from my master, with his horn full of good news. My master will be here ere morning.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>LOR.</speaker>
<line>Sweet soul, let&#8217;s in, and there expect their coming.</line>
<line>And yet no matter; why should we go in?</line>
<line>My friend Stephano, signify, I pray you,</line>
<line>Within the house, your mistress is at hand,</line>
<line>And bring your music forth into the air.</line>

<stagedir>Exit Stephano.</stagedir>
<line>How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank!</line>
<line>Here will we sit, and let the sounds of music</line>
<line>Creep in our ears. Soft stillness and the night</line>
<line>Become the touches of sweet harmony.</line>
<line>Sit, Jessica. Look how the floor of heaven</line>
<line>Is thick inlaid with patens of bright gold.</line>
<line>There&#8217;s not the smallest orb which thou behold&#8217;st</line>
<line>But in his motion like an angel sings,</line>
<line>Still quiring to the young-ey&#8217;d cherubins;</line>
<line>Such harmony is in immortal souls,</line>
<line>But whilst this muddy vesture of decay</line>
<line>Doth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it.</line>

<stagedir>Enter Musicians.</stagedir>
<line>Come ho, and wake Diana with a hymn,</line>
<line>With sweetest touches pierce your mistress&#8217; ear,</line>
<line>And draw her home with music.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Play Music.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>JES.</speaker>
<line>I am never merry when I hear sweet music.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LOR.</speaker>
<line>The reason is, your spirits are attentive;</line>
<line>For do but note a wild and wanton herd</line>
<line>Or race of youthful and unhandled colts,</line>
<line>Fetching mad bounds, bellowing and neighing loud,</line>
<line>Which is the hot condition of their blood,</line>
<line>If they but hear perchance a trumpet sound,</line>
<line>Or any air of music touch their ears,</line>
<line>You shall perceive them make a mutual stand,</line>
<line>Their savage eyes turn&#8217;d to a modest gaze,</line>
<line>By the sweet power of music; therefore the poet</line>
<line>Did feign that Orpheus drew trees, stones, and floods;</line>
<line>Since nought so stockish, hard, and full of rage,</line>
<line>But music for the time doth change his nature.</line>
<line>The man that hath no music in himself,</line>
<line>Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds,</line>
<line>Is fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoils;</line>
<line>The motions of his spirit are dull as night,</line>
<line>And his affections dark as Erebus</line>
<line>Let no such man be trusted. Mark the music.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Portia and Nerissa.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>POR.</speaker>
<line>That light we see is burning in my hall.</line>
<line>How far that little candle throws his beams!</line>
<line>So shines a good deed in a naughty world.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NER.</speaker>
<line>When the moon shone, we did not see the candle.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POR.</speaker>
<line>So doth the greater glory dim the less:</line>
<line>A substitute shines brightly as a king</line>
<line>Until a king be by, and then his state</line>
<line>Empties itself, as doth an inland brook</line>
<line>Into the main of waters. Music, hark!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NER.</speaker>
<line>It is your music, madam, of the house.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POR.</speaker>
<line>Nothing is good, I see, without respect;</line>
<line>Methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NER.</speaker>
<line>Silence bestows that virtue on it, madam.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POR.</speaker>
<line>The crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark</line>
<line>When neither is attended; and I think</line>
<line>The nightingale, if she should sing by day</line>
<line>When every goose is cackling, would be thought</line>
<line>No better a musician than the wren.</line>
<line>How many things by season season&#8217;d are</line>
<line>To their right praise and true perfection!</line>
<line>Peace ho! The Moon sleeps with Endymion,</line>
<line>And would not be awak&#8217;d.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Music ceases.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>LOR.</speaker>
<line offset="5">That is the voice,</line>
<line>Or I am much deceiv&#8217;d, of Portia.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POR.</speaker>
<line>He knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo,</line>
<line>By the bad voice!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LOR.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Dear lady, welcome home!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POR.</speaker>
<line>We have been praying for our husbands&#8217; welfare,</line>
<line>Which speed we hope the better for our words.</line>
<line>Are they return&#8217;d?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LOR.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Madam, they are not yet;</line>
<line>But there is come a messenger before,</line>
<line>To signify their coming.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POR.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Go in, Nerissa.</line>
<line>Give order to my servants that they take</line>
<line>No note at all of our being absent hence&#8212;</line>
<line>Nor you, Lorenzo&#8212;Jessica, nor you.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>A tucket sounds.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>LOR.</speaker>
<line>Your husband is at hand, I hear his trumpet.</line>
<line>We are no tell-tales, madam, fear you not.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POR.</speaker>
<line>This night methinks is but the daylight sick,</line>
<line>It looks a little paler. &#8217;Tis a day,</line>
<line>Such as the day is when the sun is hid.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Bassanio, Antonio, Gratiano, and their Followers.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>BASS.</speaker>
<line>We should hold day with the Antipodes,</line>
<line>If you would walk in absence of the sun.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POR.</speaker>
<line>Let me give light, but let me not be light,</line>
<line>For a light wife doth make a heavy husband,</line>
<line>And never be Bassanio so for me&#8212;</line>
<line>But God sort all! You are welcome home, my lord.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BASS.</speaker>
<line>I thank you, madam. Give welcome to my friend;</line>
<line>This is the man, this is Antonio,</line>
<line>To whom I am so infinitely bound.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POR.</speaker>
<line>You should in all sense be much bound to him,</line>
<line>For as I hear he was much bound for you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANT.</speaker>
<line>No more than I am well acquitted of.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POR.</speaker>
<line>Sir, you are very welcome to our house.</line>
<line>It must appear in other ways than words,</line>
<line>Therefore I scant this breathing courtesy.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GRA.</speaker>
<stagedir>To Nerissa.</stagedir>
<line>By yonder moon I swear you do me wrong;</line>
<line>In faith, I gave it to the judge&#8217;s clerk.</line>
<line>Would he were gelt that had it, for my part,</line>
<line>Since you do take it, love, so much at heart.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POR.</speaker>
<line>A quarrel ho already! What&#8217;s the matter?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GRA.</speaker>
<line>About a hoop of gold, a paltry ring</line>
<line>That she did give me, whose posy was</line>
<line>For all the world like cutler&#8217;s poetry</line>
<line>Upon a knife, &#8220;Love me, and leave me not.&#8221;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NER.</speaker>
<line>What talk you of the posy or the value?</line>
<line>You swore to me, when I did give it you,</line>
<line>That you would wear it till your hour of death,</line>
<line>And that it should lie with you in your grave.</line>
<line>Though not for me, yet for your vehement oaths,</line>
<line>You should have been respective and have kept it.</line>
<line>Gave it a judge&#8217;s clerk! No, God&#8217;s my judge,</line>
<line>The clerk will ne&#8217;er wear hair on &#8217;s face that had it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GRA.</speaker>
<line>He will, and if he live to be a man.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NER.</speaker>
<line>Ay, if a woman live to be a man.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GRA.</speaker>
<line>Now, by this hand, I gave it to a youth,</line>
<line>A kind of boy, a little scrubbed boy,</line>
<line>No higher than thyself, the judge&#8217;s clerk,</line>
<line>A prating boy, that begg&#8217;d it as a fee.</line>
<line>I could not for my heart deny it him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POR.</speaker>
<line>You were to blame, I must be plain with you,</line>
<line>To part so slightly with your wive&#8217;s first gift,</line>
<line>A thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger,</line>
<line>And so riveted with faith unto your flesh.</line>
<line>I gave my love a ring, and made him swear</line>
<line>Never to part with it, and here he stands.</line>
<line>I dare be sworn for him he would not leave it,</line>
<line>Nor pluck it from his finger, for the wealth</line>
<line>That the world masters. Now, in faith, Gratiano,</line>
<line>You give your wife too unkind a cause of grief;</line>
<line>And &#8217;twere to me I should be mad at it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BASS.</speaker>
<stagedir>Aside.</stagedir>
<line>Why, I were best to cut my left hand off,</line>
<line>And swear I lost the ring defending it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GRA.</speaker>
<line>My Lord Bassanio gave his ring away</line>
<line>Unto the judge that begg&#8217;d it, and indeed</line>
<line>Deserv&#8217;d it too; and then the boy, his clerk,</line>
<line>That took some pains in writing, he begg&#8217;d mine,</line>
<line>And neither man nor master would take aught</line>
<line>But the two rings.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POR.</speaker>
<line offset="4">What ring gave you, my lord?</line>
<line>Not that, I hope, which you receiv&#8217;d of me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BASS.</speaker>
<line>If I could add a lie unto a fault,</line>
<line>I would deny it; but you see my finger</line>
<line>Hath not the ring upon it, it is gone.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POR.</speaker>
<line>Even so void is your false heart of truth.</line>
<line>By heaven, I will ne&#8217;er come in your bed</line>
<line>Until I see the ring!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NER.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Nor I in yours</line>
<line>Till I again see mine!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BASS.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Sweet Portia,</line>
<line>If you did know to whom I gave the ring,</line>
<line>If you did know for whom I gave the ring,</line>
<line>And would conceive for what I gave the ring,</line>
<line>And how unwillingly I left the ring,</line>
<line>When nought would be accepted but the ring,</line>
<line>You would abate the strength of your displeasure.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POR.</speaker>
<line>If you had known the virtue of the ring,</line>
<line>Or half her worthiness that gave the ring,</line>
<line>Or your own honor to contain the ring,</line>
<line>You would not then have parted with the ring.</line>
<line>What man is there so much unreasonable,</line>
<line>If you had pleas&#8217;d to have defended it</line>
<line>With any terms of zeal, wanted the modesty</line>
<line>To urge the thing held as a ceremony?</line>
<line>Nerissa teaches me what to believe&#8212;</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll die for&#8217;t but some woman had the ring!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BASS.</speaker>
<line>No, by my honor, madam, by my soul,</line>
<line>No woman had it, but a civil doctor,</line>
<line>Which did refuse three thousand ducats of me,</line>
<line>And begg&#8217;d the ring, the which I did deny him,</line>
<line>And suffer&#8217;d him to go displeas&#8217;d away&#8212;</line>
<line>Even he that had held up the very life</line>
<line>Of my dear friend. What should I say, sweet lady?</line>
<line>I was enforc&#8217;d to send it after him,</line>
<line>I was beset with shame and courtesy,</line>
<line>My honor would not let ingratitude</line>
<line>So much besmear it. Pardon me, good lady,</line>
<line>For by these blessed candles of the night,</line>
<line>Had you been there, I think you would have begg&#8217;d</line>
<line>The ring of me to give the worthy doctor.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POR.</speaker>
<line>Let not that doctor e&#8217;er come near my house.</line>
<line>Since he hath got the jewel that I loved,</line>
<line>And that which you did swear to keep for me,</line>
<line>I will become as liberal as you,</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll not deny him any thing I have,</line>
<line>No, not my body nor my husband&#8217;s bed.</line>
<line>Know him I shall, I am well sure of it.</line>
<line>Lie not a night from home. Watch me like Argus;</line>
<line>If you do not, if I be left alone,</line>
<line>Now by mine honor, which is yet mine own,</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll have that doctor for my bedfellow.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NER.</speaker>
<line>And I his clerk; therefore be well advis&#8217;d</line>
<line>How you do leave me to mine own protection.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GRA.</speaker>
<line>Well, do you so; let not me take him then,</line>
<line>For if I do, I&#8217;ll mar the young clerk&#8217;s pen.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANT.</speaker>
<line>I am th&#8217; unhappy subject of these quarrels.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POR.</speaker>
<line>Sir, grieve not you, you are welcome notwithstanding.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BASS.</speaker>
<line>Portia, forgive me this enforced wrong,</line>
<line>And in the hearing of these many friends</line>
<line>I swear to thee, even by thine own fair eyes,</line>
<line>Wherein I see myself&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POR.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Mark you but that!</line>
<line>In both my eyes he doubly sees himself,</line>
<line>In each eye, one. Swear by your double self,</line>
<line>And there&#8217;s an oath of credit.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BASS.</speaker>
<line offset="6">Nay, but hear me.</line>
<line>Pardon this fault, and by my soul I swear</line>
<line>I never more will break an oath with thee.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANT.</speaker>
<line>I once did lend my body for his wealth,</line>
<line>Which but for him that had your husband&#8217;s ring</line>
<line>Had quite miscarried. I dare be bound again,</line>
<line>My soul upon the forfeit, that your lord</line>
<line>Will never more break faith advisedly.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POR.</speaker>
<line>Then you shall be his surety. Give him this,</line>
<line>And bid him keep it better than the other.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANT.</speaker>
<line>Here, Lord Bassanio, swear to keep this ring.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BASS.</speaker>
<line>By heaven, it is the same I gave the doctor!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POR.</speaker>
<line>I had it of him. Pardon me, Bassanio,</line>
<line>For by this ring, the doctor lay with me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NER.</speaker>
<line>And pardon me, my gentle Gratiano,</line>
<line>For that same scrubbed boy, the doctor&#8217;s clerk,</line>
<line>In lieu of this last night did lie with me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GRA.</speaker>
<line>Why, this is like the mending of highways</line>
<line>In summer, where the ways are fair enough.</line>
<line>What, are we cuckolds ere we have deserv&#8217;d it?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POR.</speaker>
<line>Speak not so grossly, you are all amaz&#8217;d.</line>
<line>Here is a letter, read it at your leisure.</line>
<line>It comes from Padua, from Bellario.</line>
<line>There you shall find that Portia was the doctor,</line>
<line>Nerissa there her clerk. Lorenzo here</line>
<line>Shall witness I set forth as soon as you,</line>
<line>And even but now return&#8217;d; I have not yet</line>
<line>Enter&#8217;d my house. Antonio, you are welcome,</line>
<line>And I have better news in store for you</line>
<line>Than you expect. Unseal this letter soon;</line>
<line>There you shall find three of your argosies</line>
<line>Are richly come to harbor suddenly.</line>
<line>You shall not know by what strange accident</line>
<line>I chanced on this letter.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANT.</speaker>
<line offset="5">I am dumb.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BASS.</speaker>
<line>Were you the doctor, and I knew you not?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GRA.</speaker>
<line>Were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NER.</speaker>
<line>Ay, but the clerk that never means to do it,</line>
<line>Unless he live until he be a man.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BASS.</speaker>
<line>Sweet doctor, you shall be my bedfellow&#8212;</line>
<line>When I am absent, then lie with my wife.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANT.</speaker>
<line>Sweet lady, you have given me life and living,</line>
<line>For here I read for certain that my ships</line>
<line>Are safely come to road.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POR.</speaker>
<line offset="5">How now, Lorenzo?</line>
<line>My clerk hath some good comforts too for you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NER.</speaker>
<line>Ay, and I&#8217;ll give them him without a fee.</line>
<line>There do I give to you and Jessica,</line>
<line>From the rich Jew, a special deed of gift,</line>
<line>After his death, of all he dies possess&#8217;d of.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LOR.</speaker>
<line>Fair ladies, you drop manna in the way</line>
<line>Of starved people.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POR.</speaker>
<line offset="4">It is almost morning,</line>
<line>And yet I am sure you are not satisfied</line>
<line>Of these events at full. Let us go in,</line>
<line>And charge us there upon inter&#8217;gatories,</line>
<line>And we will answer all things faithfully.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GRA.</speaker>
<line>Let it be so. The first inter&#8217;gatory</line>
<line>That my Nerissa shall be sworn on is,</line>
<line>Whether till the next night she had rather stay,</line>
<line>Or go to bed now, being two hours to day.</line>
<line>But were the day come, I should wish it dark</line>
<line>Till I were couching with the doctor&#8217;s clerk.</line>
<line>Well, while I live I&#8217;ll fear no other thing</line>
<line>So sore, as keeping safe Nerissa&#8217;s ring.</line>
