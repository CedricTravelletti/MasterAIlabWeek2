<personae playtitle="Henry VIII">

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="KING.">King Henry the Eighth</persname>
<persdescription>King Henry VIII is not exactly the Holbein portrait yet. A young man still growing into his rule, he relies much too much on the advice of Cardinal Wolsey, but grows to be a worthy king over the course of the play. Not paying enough attention to the business of the state, he allows Wolsey to enact a number of measures that harm the people, something he himself wishes to avoid. He spends his time impressing the King of France or playing in masques rather than in governing. He can be short and irritable with people, especially though who disturb him, and is at times too brusque for his own good. His temper is feared by his courtiers. Though he loves and admires his wife Katherine, his conscience begins to bother him when the question of the legitimacy of his marriage comes up; and the more he is convinced that he must divorce her, the worse he treats her. However, he both meets and begins showing favor to Anne Bullen well before the failed attempt to try the Queen. He comes to dislike the officials of Rome, and realizes that their interests are not necessarily his; when Wolsey&#8217;s corruption is laid bare to him, he places his trust instead in Protestants, and tests them before trusting them. He has the common touch, managing to relate to people on a personal level despite their difference in status. By the end of the play he prefers to expose his enemies by placing them in a position where they must make their genuine thoughts clear, thereby gaining undeniable evidence, rather than trusting the word of unreliable witnesses as he does in Buckingham&#8217;s trial. He also learns to identify and discount mere flattery. The lessons he learns from having had too much confidence in Wolsey allow him to mature into a wise King.</persdescription>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="WOL.">Cardinal Wolsey</persname>
<persdescription>Cardinal Wolsey is King Henry&#8217;s Lord Chancellor and chief adviser. He is deeply ambitious, thoroughly corrupt, and very generous. The son of a butcher, he has made his way up in the world through his own abilities, despite the hatred of noblemen who regard him as an upstart. Despite his protestations, he works for himself before the King, installing his puppets in all the major jobs he can to surround the King with his own people, working against both Katherine and Anne Bullen, and hoping to become Pope. He overtaxes the people behind the King&#8217;s back and refuses to take responsibility for it, bribes witnesses to bring about Buckingham&#8217;s downfall, makes peace treaties without consulting the King, has his own personal symbol added to the coinage, and amasses a vast personal fortune, as he inherited none. He is a slippery speaker, proclaiming his meekness and goodwill, but he is intensely proud, something recognized by all of his enemies, though not by the King, who trusts him implicitly until he sees visual proof of Wolsey&#8217;s machinations. He is named by the Pope co-judge with Campeius of the validity of Queen Katherine&#8217;s marriage to the King. He becomes agitated when he realizes that the King&#8217;s love for Anne Bullen is making him act independently and listen to heretics. He realizes that he is done for as soon as he discovers that the King has read the letters he sent to the Pope and found out how much he has planned to use to bribe his way to the papacy, but he still refuses to accept his fall unless it is confirmed by the King in person. He takes his fall with resignation and philosophy. Despite everything he is loyal to the King. A bureaucrat to the last, he insists on making a complete inventory of all that he owns when it is confiscated by the King. After his death, even his enemies admit that he was a remarkable man, highly generous and a lover of learning. He enjoys a good party, and knows the King well enough to realize that he must be one of the masked men who crash his feast, and recognizes him behind his disguise.</persdescription>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="CAM.">Cardinal Campeius</persname>
<persdescription>Cardinal Campeius is sent by the Pope to act as co-judge with Wolsey in the matter of the validity of the King and Queen&#8217;s marriage. He becomes friendly with Wolsey, and intends to help him become Pope. With Wolsey, he tries to argue Queen Katherine into agreeing with the King, but in unsuccessful. Unlike Cranmer, he refuses to judge the Queen in her absence. He leaves the country without taking official leave of the King, to the latter&#8217;s wrath.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="CAP.">Lord Capuchius</persname>
<persdescription>Lord Capuchius is the ambassador of Queen Katherine&#8217;s nephew, the Holy Roman Emperor. He has not seen Katherine since before her divorce. He is sent by the King to see how Katherine is doing, but is in time only to receive a letter to King Henry that is essentially her will. He promises to do what he can to see it honored.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="CRAN.">Cranmer, Archbishop of Canterbury</persname>
<persdescription>Cranmer, Archbishop of Canterbury is a priest won over to the reforming side of the church. As a Protestant, he is loathed and despised by conservative Catholics such as Gardiner. As the King&#8217;s divorce proceedings make no progress, Cranmer grows close to the monarch, undoing Wolsey&#8217;s hold on the King. He is an upright, honorable, honest and incorruptible man, whose manner is so different from Wolsey&#8217;s that it gains the King&#8217;s trust after the latter&#8217;s fall. Cranmer is an emotional man, prone to weeping with happiness. He does not defend himself when brought to trial before the royal council, merely insisting on his own honesty and good faith until he is able to counterattack with the King&#8217;s trust in him. He agrees to embrace Gardiner as a friend despite the latter&#8217;s persecution of him. He is named as Princess Elizabeth&#8217;s godfather by the King, and baptizes her, prophesying that she will become the greatest monarch England as ever known. Despite his great humility and goodness, he is capable of sarcasm, and he has no qualms about divorcing the king from Queen Katherine in her absence.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="NOR.">Duke of Norfolk</persname>
<persdescription>The Duke of Norfolk is a cautious friend of Buckingham&#8217;s who attempts to keep him for acting or speaking too rashly. He is more charitable than the rest of the nobility, having some admiration for Cardinal Wolsey and not thinking overly ill of him. His opinion changes as the Cardinal&#8217;s actions cause more and more damage, particularly to Queen Katherine, and he joins those working to topple Wolsey. The King sends Norfolk to announce his sentence on the Cardinal. Though he respects Cranmer, Norfolk is a member of the council that attempts to judge him for heresy, having become Earl Marshal, though he takes no active part in the interrogation. He carries the rod of marshalship that identifies him as Earl Marshal in Queen Anne&#8217;s coronation procession.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="SUF.">Duke of Suffolk</persname>
<persdescription>Charles, Duke of Suffolk is one of King Henry&#8217;s close friends and game partners. He thinks it more likely that desire for Anne Bullen explains the King&#8217;s wanting a divorce than remorse over having married his brother&#8217;s widow. He comes to admire Anne once he knows her, and is aware of the plans for her coronation before they are common knowledge. He is not a supporter of Wolsey, and joins in Surrey&#8217;s condemnation of him once he has fallen. He does not play games as well as does the King, unless the latter is distracted. Having become High Steward, he is a member of the council that attempts to judge Cranmer for heresy, though he takes no active part in the interrogation and tried to dissuade the council from bringing Cranmer to trial. He carries the white rod of office that identifies him as High Steward in Queen Anne&#8217;s coronation procession.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="BUCK.">Duke of Buckingham</persname>
<persdescription>The Duke of Buckingham is a loyal and hot-tempered lord who detests and despises Cardinal Wolsey, and suffers for it. He dislikes Wolsey for a variety of reasons, including his influence with the King, his corruption, and the fact that he is not an aristocrat. His outspoken enmity for the Cardinal, the very mention of whom can send him into a rage, leads to his downfall when he is accused by a vengeful former employee whom Wolsey chooses to listen to. He is found guilty of high treason when he is unable to refute the testimony brought against him. He is an excellent speaker and known as such, and highly educated, but the suspicion of treason on him is high because his father once rebelled against a King (see <persnameref>Richard III</persnameref>). He dies well.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="SUR.">Earl of Surrey</persname>
<persdescription>The Earl of Surrey is Buckingham&#8217;s son-in-law and is delighted to be able to join a plot to topple Cardinal Wolsey, who caused Buckingham&#8217;s fall and sent Surrey to rule Ireland so that he could not be around to plead for him. He spits out accusations at the Cardinal once he has fallen but cannot get him to admit to any wrongdoing. He carries a rod of silver with a dove on it in Queen Anne&#8217;s coronation procession. He is a member of the council that attempts to judge Cranmer for heresy, though he takes no active part in the interrogation.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="CHAM.">Lord Chamberlain</persname>
<persdescription>Lord Chamberlain is the head of the King&#8217;s household, an old-fashioned, conservative chauvinist who doesn&#8217;t want to see English noblemen dressing like Frenchmen and who has an eye for the ladies. Cardinal Wolsey takes care to keep him on his good side, but as the Cardinal&#8217;s arrogance grows so do the Chamberlain&#8217;s worries. He approves of Anne Bullen as the King&#8217;s love, thinking her fit to breed. He is a loyal man who carries out his duties to the fullest and is frustrated when his porter cannot keep a mob from the door.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="CHAN.">Lord Chancellor</persname>
<persdescription>Lord Chancellor is King Henry&#8217;s head of government, a position held by Cardinal Wolsey until his downfall.

He takes part in Queen Anne&#8217;s coronation procession, but is a good, conservative Catholic concerned about Cranmer&#8217;s newfangled religious ideas, and heads the meeting of the council that attempts to judge the Archbishop for heresy, and condemns him to the Tower before Cranmer pulls out his trump card of the King&#8217;s favor. Though we are told that Sir Thomas More has taken over the job, historically, by the time of the trial More was no longer Chancellor (see <persnameref>Sir Thomas More</persnameref> for details).</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="GARD.">Gardiner</persname>
<persdescription>Gardiner, King Henry&#8217;s secretary and later Bishop of Winchester, is entirely Wolsey&#8217;s creature, placed as the King&#8217;s secretary by the Cardinal because he will obey the latter before the former. A conservative Catholic, as bishop he becomes the spearhead of opposition to Anne Bullen, Cranmer, and the other heretics, not hiding his hope that Anne will die in childbirth, even though he escorted her to her coronation. He arranges for Cranmer to be tried by the council, a meeting at which he acts as prosecutor. He is a nasty man, but a smooth and sycophantic flatterer to the King. He agrees to embrace Cranmer as a friend at the King&#8217;s command.</persdescription>

<persaliases>
	<persname short="KATH.">Katherine</persname>
</persaliases>
<persdescription>Queen Katherine is King Henry&#8217;s wife of twenty years, a Spanish princess, widow of his elder brother Arthur, and the mother of his daughter. She is a kind and intelligent woman beloved by her subjects, whom she cares for deeply. She is an enemy of Cardinal Wolsey&#8217;s, but does not engage him directly, preferring to raise matters subtly with the King. She is suspicious of the honesty of Buckingham&#8217;s Surveyor. Her world is turned upside down when the King informs her that he wants a divorce, as he fears that he has done wrong by marrying his brother&#8217;s widow, despite the fact that the wisest men of the time agreed to the marriage at the time, and that this is why they have had no living male child. Passionate and noble, she refuses to agree to the divorce, openly pleads her own cause, and refuses her enemy Wolsey as judge, appealing over his head to the Pope. Having no allies, she is unable to win her cause, though she puts up a valiant fight. She is enraged at being betrayed by the Church, and saddened that she can find no-one to help her, however much the people pity her. She refuses to come to any court to plead her case, and is therefore divorced in her absence. Growing ill in her exile in the country, barely able to walk, she cannot help but be glad to hear of Wolsey&#8217;s death. Despite her disgrace she insists on being treated as a Queen, refusing to acknowledge the change forced on her. Her final thoughts are to beg the King to be good to those that served her, and to keep her honor intact by being buried according to her state. She has a vision of being welcomed into heaven that makes her death much easier to bear. Nobody has a bad thing to say about her.</persdescription>

Beautiful, kind, pitying, demure and modest, she sees and regrets what is happening to Queen Katherine, and claims that she would not wish to be in her place. Suddenly named Marchioness of Pembroke, she is worried about what this might imply, and hopes that the Queen will not here of this, seeing as Katherine is losing all she has just as Anne begins to receive. She is a Protestant, which earns her Cardinal Wolsey&#8217;s enmity. The King marries her in secret even before his divorce from Katherine is pronounced, and has her crowned once it is official. She then falls pregnant and gives birth to the future Queen Elizabeth.</persdescription>

<line form="verse">The subject will deserve it. Such as give</line>
<line form="verse">Their money out of hope they may believe,</line>
<line form="verse">May here find truth too. Those that come to see</line>

<line form="verse">Richly in two short hours. Only they</line>
<line form="verse">That come to hear a merry, bawdy play,</line>
<line form="verse">A noise of targets, or to see a fellow</line>
<line form="verse">In a long motley coat guarded with yellow,</line>
<line form="verse">Will be deceiv&#8217;d. For, gentle hearers, know,</line>
<line form="verse">To rank our chosen truth with such a show</line>
<line form="verse">As fool and fight is, beside forfeiting</line>
<line form="verse">Our own brains and the opinion that we bring</line>
<line form="verse">To make that only true we now intend,</line>
<line form="verse">Will leave us never an understanding friend.</line>
<line form="verse">Therefore, for goodness sake, and as you are known</line>
<line form="verse">The first and happiest hearers of the town,</line>
<line form="verse">Be sad, as we would make ye. Think ye see</line>

<scenelocation>London. An ante-chamber in the palace.</scenelocation>
<scenepersonae>(Duke of Norfolk, Duke of Buckingham, Lord Abergavenny, Cardinal Wolsey, Guards, Secretaries, Brandon, Sergeant-at-Arms, Wolsey&#8217;s First Secretary)</scenepersonae>
<scenedescription>The Duke of Buckingham hears from the Duke of Norfolk about the meeting between King Henry VIII and the French king. On hearing that the stunning entertainments provided were set up by Cardinal Wolsey, Buckingham erupts, as he hates and despises the Cardinal as an over-proud, lower-class upstart, a corrupt man slowly taking over all power in the state. Norfolk advises Buckingham to be careful. Wolsey enters, and he and Buckingham glare at one another. The Cardinal goes to interrogate a servant of Buckingham&#8217;s. Buckingham guesses that Wolsey is planning to make a move against him, and hotheadedly swears that he will denounce the Cardinal to the King for treason. Before he can do so, he is arrested for treason himself, and learning that his surveyor has talked, realizes that he is done for.</scenedescription>

<scenedescription>Enter the king, leaning on Wolsey&#8217;s shoulder. Henry thanks Wolsey for having discovered Buckingham&#8217;s conspiracy. Queen Katherine enters and tells Henry that his poor subjects are in rebellion at the heavy taxes laid on them by Wolsey. The King berates Wolsey for taxing each man a sixth of his income, and repeals the tax. Wolsey has the court secretary write every shire that the tax has been revoked due to his (Wolsey&#8217;s) intercession. Queen Katherine (who pities Buckingham) listens at Henry&#8217;s side as the King interviews Buckingham&#8217;s surveyor, who relates several details of the Duke&#8217;s alleged treachery. Convinced that Buckingham intended to assassinate him and take the throne, the King commits to having the Duke tried.</scenedescription>

<line form="verse">Most pestilent to th&#8217; hearing, and, to bear &#8217;em,</line>
<line form="verse">The back is sacrifice to th&#8217; load. They say</line>

<line form="verse">Under your promis&#8217;d pardon. The subject&#8217;s grief</line>
<line form="verse">Comes through commissions, which compels from each</line>
<line form="verse">The sixt part of his substance, to be levied</line>
<line form="verse">Without delay; and the pretense for this</line>
<line form="verse">Is nam&#8217;d, your wars in France. This makes bold mouths,</line>
<line form="verse">Tongues spit their duties out, and cold hearts freeze</line>
<line form="verse">Allegiance in them; their curses now</line>
<line form="verse">Live where their prayers did; and it&#8217;s come to pass</line>

<line form="verse">As rav&#8217;nous fishes, do a vessel follow</line>
<line form="verse">That is new trimm&#8217;d, but benefit no further</line>
<line form="verse">Than vainly longing. What we oft do best,</line>
<line form="verse">By sick interpreters (once weak ones) is</line>
<line form="verse">Not ours, or not allow&#8217;d; what worst, as oft,</line>

<line form="verse">And, though we leave it with a root, thus hack&#8217;d,</line>
<line form="verse">The air will drink the sap. To every county</line>
<line form="verse">Where this is question&#8217;d send our letters, with</line>

<line form="verse">Not well dispos&#8217;d, the mind growing once corrupt,</line>

<line form="verse">But pray how pass&#8217;d it?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. GENT.</speaker>
<line form="verse">I&#8217;ll tell you in a little. The great Duke</line>
<line form="verse">Came to the bar; where to his accusations</line>
<line form="verse">He pleaded still not guilty, and alleged</line>
<line form="verse">Many sharp reasons to defeat the law.</line>
<line form="verse">The King&#8217;s attorney on the contrary</line>
<line form="verse">Urg&#8217;d on the examinations, proofs, confessions</line>
<line form="verse">Of divers witnesses, which the Duke desir&#8217;d</line>
<line form="verse">To him brought <latin xml:lang="la">viv&#226; voce</latin> to his face;</line>
<line form="verse">At which appear&#8217;d against him his surveyor,</line>
<line form="verse">Sir Gilbert Perk his chancellor, and John Car,</line>
<line form="verse">Confessor to him, with that devil monk,</line>
<line form="verse">Hopkins, that made this mischief.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. GENT.</speaker>
<line form="verse" offset="7">That was he</line>
<line form="verse">That fed him with his prophecies?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. GENT.</speaker>
<line form="verse" offset="7">The same;</line>
<line form="verse">All these accus&#8217;d him strongly, which he fain</line>
<line form="verse">Would have flung from him; but indeed he could not.</line>
<line form="verse">And so his peers upon this evidence</line>
<line form="verse">Have found him guilty of high treason. Much</line>
<line form="verse">He spoke, and learnedly, for life; but all</line>
<line form="verse">Was either pitied in him or forgotten.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. GENT.</speaker>
<line form="verse">After all this, how did he bear himself?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. GENT.</speaker>
<line form="verse">When he was brought again to th&#8217; bar, to hear</line>
<line form="verse">His knell rung out, his judgment, he was stirr&#8217;d</line>
<line form="verse">With such an agony he sweat extremely,</line>
<line form="verse">And something spoke in choler, ill, and hasty.</line>
<line form="verse">But he fell to himself again, and sweetly</line>
<line form="verse">In all the rest show&#8217;d a most noble patience.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. GENT.</speaker>
<line form="verse">I do not think he fears death.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. GENT.</speaker>
<line form="verse" offset="6">Sure he does not,</line>
<line form="verse">He never was so womanish. The cause</line>
<line form="verse">He may a little grieve at.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. GENT.</speaker>
<line form="verse" offset="5">Certainly</line>
<line form="verse">The Cardinal is the end of this.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. GENT.</speaker>
<line form="verse" offset="7">&#8217;Tis likely,</line>
<line form="verse">By all conjectures: first, Kildare&#8217;s attendure,</line>
<line form="verse">Then deputy of Ireland, who remov&#8217;d,</line>
<line form="verse">Earl Surrey was sent thither, and in haste too,</line>
<line form="verse">Lest he should help his father.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. GENT.</speaker>
<line form="verse" offset="6">That trick of state</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. GENT.</speaker>
<line form="verse" offset="5">At his return</line>
<line form="verse">No doubt he will requite it. This is noted,</line>
<line form="verse">And generally, whoever the King favors,</line>
<line form="verse">The Card&#8217;nal instantly will find employment,</line>
<line form="verse">And far enough from court too.</line>

<line form="verse">The law I bear no malice for my death;</line>

<line form="verse">But those that sought it I could wish more Christians.</line>

<line form="verse">Yet let &#8217;em look they glory not in mischief,</line>
<line form="verse">Nor build their evils on the graves of great men,</line>

<line form="verse">For further life in this world I ne&#8217;er hope,</line>
<line form="verse">Nor will I sue, although the King have mercies</line>
<line form="verse">More than I dare make faults. You few that lov&#8217;d me</line>
<line form="verse">And dare be bold to weep for Buckingham,</line>
<line form="verse">His noble friends and fellows, whom to leave</line>
<line form="verse">Is only bitter to him, only dying,</line>
<line form="verse">Go with me like good angels to my end,</line>

<line form="verse">You met him half in heaven. My vows and prayers</line>

<line form="verse" offset="6">Nay, Sir Nicholas,</line>

<line form="verse">Yet I am richer than my base accusers,</line>
<line form="verse">That never knew what truth meant. I now seal it;</line>
<line form="verse">And with that blood will make &#8217;em one day groan for&#8217;t.</line>
<line form="verse">My noble father, Henry of Buckingham,</line>
<line form="verse">Who first rais&#8217;d head against usurping Richard,</line>
<line form="verse">Flying for succor to his servant Banister,</line>
<line form="verse">Being distress&#8217;d, was by that wretch betray&#8217;d,</line>

<line form="verse">Henry the Seventh succeeding, truly pitying</line>
<line form="verse">My father&#8217;s loss, like a most royal prince</line>
<line form="verse">Restor&#8217;d me to my honors; and out of ruins</line>
<line form="verse">Made my name once more noble. Now his son,</line>
<line form="verse">Henry the Eight, life, honor, name, and all</line>
<line form="verse">That made me happy, at one stroke has taken</line>
<line form="verse">Forever from the world. I had my trial,</line>
<line form="verse">And must needs say a noble one; which makes me</line>
<line form="verse">A little happier than my wretched father.</line>
<line form="verse">Yet thus far we are one in fortunes: both</line>
<line form="verse">Fell by our servants, by those men we lov&#8217;d most;</line>
<line form="verse">A most unnatural and faithless service.</line>
<line form="verse">Heaven has an end in all; yet, you that hear me,</line>
<line form="verse">This from a dying man receive as certain:</line>
<line form="verse">Where you are liberal of your loves and counsels,</line>
<line form="verse">Be sure you be not loose; for those you make friends</line>
<line form="verse">And give your hearts to, when they once perceive</line>
<line form="verse">The least rub in your fortunes, fall away</line>
<line form="verse">Like water from ye, never found again</line>
<line form="verse">But where they mean to sink ye. All good people,</line>
<line form="verse">Pray for me! I must now forsake ye. The last hour</line>
<line form="verse">Of my long weary life is come upon me.</line>
<line form="verse">Farewell!</line>

<line form="verse">And thus far clear him. Now, what mov&#8217;d me to&#8217;t,</line>
<line form="verse">I will be bold with time and your attention:</line>
<line form="verse">Then mark th&#8217; inducement. Thus it came; give heed to&#8217;t:</line>
<line form="verse">My conscience first receiv&#8217;d a tenderness,</line>
<line form="verse">Scruple, and prick, on certain speeches utter&#8217;d</line>
<line form="verse">By th&#8217; Bishop of Bayonne, then French embassador,</line>
<line form="verse">Who had been hither sent on the debating</line>
<line form="verse">A marriage &#8217;twixt the Duke of Orleance and</line>
<line form="verse">Our daughter Mary. I&#8217; th&#8217; progress of this business,</line>
<line form="verse">Ere a determinate resolution, he</line>
<line form="verse">(I mean the Bishop) did require a respite,</line>
<line form="verse">Wherein he might the King his lord advertise</line>
<line form="verse">Whether our daughter were legitimate,</line>
<line form="verse">Respecting this our marriage with the dowager,</line>
<line form="verse">Sometimes our brother&#8217;s wife. This respite shook</line>
<line form="verse">The bosom of my conscience, enter&#8217;d me,</line>
<line form="verse">Yea, with a spitting power, and made to tremble</line>
<line form="verse">The region of my breast, which forc&#8217;d such way,</line>
<line form="verse">That many maz&#8217;d considerings did throng</line>
<line form="verse">And press&#8217;d in with this caution. First, methought</line>
<line form="verse">I stood not in the smile of heaven, who had</line>
<line form="verse">Commanded nature, that my lady&#8217;s womb,</line>
<line form="verse">If it conceiv&#8217;d a male-child by me, should</line>
<line form="verse">Do no more offices of life to&#8217;t than</line>
<line form="verse">The grave does to th&#8217; dead; for her male issue</line>
<line form="verse">Or died where they were made, or shortly after</line>
<line form="verse">This world had air&#8217;d them. Hence I took a thought</line>
<line form="verse">This was a judgment on me, that my kingdom</line>
<line form="verse">(Well worthy the best heir o&#8217; th&#8217; world) should not</line>
<line form="verse">Be gladded in&#8217;t by me. Then follows, that</line>
<line form="verse">I weigh&#8217;d the danger which my realms stood in</line>
<line form="verse">By this my issue&#8217;s fail, and that gave to me</line>
<line form="verse">Many a groaning throe. Thus hulling in</line>
<line form="verse">The wild sea of my conscience, I did steer</line>
<line form="verse">Toward this remedy, whereupon we are</line>
<line form="verse">Now present here together: that&#8217;s to say,</line>
<line form="verse">I meant to rectify my conscience&#8212;which</line>
<line form="verse">I then did feel full sick, and yet not well&#8212;</line>

<scenelocation>London. Antechamber to King Henry VIII&#8217;s apartment.</scenelocation>
<scenepersonae>(Duke of Norfolk, Duke of Suffolk, Lord Surrey, Lord Chamberlain, Wolsey, Cromwell, King, Lovell)</scenepersonae>
<scenedescription>The noblemen have heard that the King saw a secret letter of Wolsey&#8217;s, and feel that the Cardinal is already losing the King&#8217;s support. They plan to unite their complaints against Wolsey. The Lord Chamberlain informs them that the King has already married Anne Bullen. Wolsey passes by, muttering to himself about Anne unsuitability to be Queen and against the King&#8217;s new favorite, Cranmer, who has arranged his divorce. The King enters, reading an inventory that for the first time reveals the extent of Wolsey&#8217;s wealth to him. Angry, he thrusts both this inventory and the letter Wolsey wrote to the Pope into the Cardinal&#8217;s hands. He realizes that he is done for. Noblemen enter and tell Wolsey to give up his office and remain a prisoner in Asher-house. The Cardinal refuses to give back the Great Seal of his office except to the King himself and refuses to be cowed by the nobles&#8217; castigations. Left alone, he reflects on his fall. His servant Cromwell finds him, and gives him the latest news: that Thomas more has been named Chancellor, that Cranmer is named Archbishop of Canterbury, and that the King has married Anne Bullen. Wolsey realizes that this was the true cause of his fall. He counsels Cromwell against ambition, and leaves, humbled.</scenedescription>

<line form="verse">As well as I am able. The rich stream</line>
<line form="verse">Of lords and ladies, having brought the Queen</line>
<line form="verse">To a prepar&#8217;d place in the choir, fell off</line>
<line form="verse">A distance from her; while her Grace sate down</line>

<line form="verse">(Doublets, I think) flew up, and had their faces</line>
<line form="verse">Been loose, this day they had been lost. Such joy</line>
<line form="verse">I never saw before. Great-bellied women,</line>
<line form="verse">That had not half a week to go, like rams</line>
<line form="verse">In the old time of war, would shake the press</line>
<line form="verse">And make &#8217;em reel before &#8217;em. No man living</line>

<line form="verse">Then rose again and bow&#8217;d her to the people;</line>
<line form="verse">When by the Archbishop of Canterbury</line>
<line form="verse">She had all the royal makings of a queen,</line>
<line form="verse">As holy oil, Edward Confessor&#8217;s crown,</line>
<line form="verse">The rod, and bird of peace, and all such emblems</line>
<line form="verse">Laid nobly on her; which perform&#8217;d, the choir,</line>
<line form="verse">With all the choicest music of the kingdom,</line>
<line form="verse">Together sung Te Deum. So she parted,</line>

<line form="verse">Foretold should be his last, full of repentance,</line>

<line form="verse">Of an unbounded stomach, ever ranking</line>
<line form="verse">Himself with princes; one that by suggestion</line>
<line form="verse">Tied all the kingdom. Simony was fair play;</line>
<line form="verse">His own opinion was his law. I&#8217; th&#8217; presence</line>
<line form="verse">He would say untruths, and be ever double</line>

<scenedescription>Lovell reports to Gardiner that Anne is in labor, and that it is feared she may day. Gardiner says that things won&#8217;t be right until Anne and her two agents, Cranmer and Cromwell are dead. The King, anxious, walks the halls, and meets the new Archbishop of Canterbury, Cranmer. He informs Cranmer that he is to be tried for heresy. The man&#8217;s steadfastness moves Henry, who promises to protect him.

<line form="verse">That chair stand empty; but we all are men,</line>
<line form="verse">In our own natures frail, and capable</line>
<line form="verse">Of our flesh; few are angels; out of which frailty</line>
<line form="verse">And want of wisdom, you, that best should teach us,</line>
<line form="verse">Have misdemean&#8217;d yourself, and not a little:</line>
<line form="verse">Toward the King first, then his laws, in filling</line>
<line form="verse">The whole realm by your teaching and your chaplains&#8217;</line>
<line form="verse">(For so we are inform&#8217;d) with new opinions,</line>
<line form="verse">Divers and dangerous; which are heresies,</line>
<line form="verse">And, not reform&#8217;d, may prove pernicious.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GARD.</speaker>
<line form="verse">Which reformation must be sudden too,</line>
<line form="verse">My noble lords; for those that tame wild horses</line>

<line form="verse">To one man&#8217;s honor, this contagious sickness,</line>
<line form="verse">Farewell all physic! And what follows then?</line>

<line form="verse">And the strong course of my authority</line>

<line form="verse">Was ever to do well; nor is there living</line>

<speech>
<speaker>PORT.</speaker>
<line form="prose">What should you do, but knock &#8217;em down by th&#8217; dozens? Is this Moorfields to muster in? Or have we some strange Indian with the great tool come to court, the women so besiege us? Bless me, what a fry of fornication is at door! On my Christian conscience, this one christening will beget a thousand, here will be father, godfather, and all together.</line>

<speaker>PORT. MAN.</speaker>
<line form="prose">The spoons will be the bigger, sir. There is a fellow somewhat near the door, he should be a brazier by his face, for, o&#8217; my conscience, twenty of the dog-days now reign in &#8217;s nose; all that stand about him are under the line, they need no other penance: that fire-drake did I hit three times on the head, and three times was his nose discharg&#8217;d against me; he stands there like a mortar-piece to blow us. There was a haberdasher&#8217;s wife of small wit near him, that rail&#8217;d upon me till her pink&#8217;d porringer fell off her head, for kindling such a combustion in the state. I miss&#8217;d the meteor once, and hit that woman, who cried out &#8220;Clubs!&#8221; , when I might see from far some forty truncheoners draw to her succor, which were the hope o&#8217; th&#8217; Strond, where she was quarter&#8217;d. They fell on, I made good my place; at length they came to th&#8217; broom-staff to me, I defied &#8217;em still, when suddenly a file of boys behind &#8217;em, loose shot, deliver&#8217;d such a show&#8217;r of pibbles, that I was fain to draw mine honor in, and let &#8217;em win the work. The devil was amongst &#8217;em, I think, surely.</line>

<line form="prose">These are the youths that thunder at a playhouse and fight for bitten apples, that no audience but the tribulation of Tower-hill or the limbs of Lime-house, their dear brothers, are able to endure.

<line form="verse">Which we have not done neither: that I fear</line>
<line form="verse">All the expected good w&#8217; are like to hear</line>

<line form="verse">The merciful construction of good women,</line>
<line form="verse">For such a one we show&#8217;d &#8217;em. If they smile,</line>
<line form="verse">And say &#8217;twill do, I know within a while</line>

<line form="verse">If they hold when their ladies bid &#8217;em clap.</line></speech>
