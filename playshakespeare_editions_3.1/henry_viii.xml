<speaker>PROLOGUE</speaker>
<line>I come no more to make you laugh; things now</line>
<line>That bear a weighty and a serious brow,</line>
<line>Sad, high, and working, full of state and woe:</line>
<line>Such noble scenes as draw the eye to flow,</line>
<line>We now present. Those that can pity, here</line>
<line>May (if they think it well) let fall a tear;</line>
<line>The subject will deserve it. Such as give</line>
<line>Their money out of hope they may believe,</line>
<line>May here find truth too. Those that come to see</line>
<line>Only a show or two, and so agree</line>
<line>The play may pass, if they be still and willing,</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll undertake may see away their shilling</line>
<line>Richly in two short hours. Only they</line>
<line>That come to hear a merry, bawdy play,</line>
<line>A noise of targets, or to see a fellow</line>
<line>In a long motley coat guarded with yellow,</line>
<line>Will be deceiv&#8217;d. For, gentle hearers, know,</line>
<line>To rank our chosen truth with such a show</line>
<line>As fool and fight is, beside forfeiting</line>
<line>Our own brains and the opinion that we bring</line>
<line>To make that only true we now intend,</line>
<line>Will leave us never an understanding friend.</line>
<line>Therefore, for goodness sake, and as you are known</line>
<line>The first and happiest hearers of the town,</line>
<line>Be sad, as we would make ye. Think ye see</line>
<line>The very persons of our noble story</line>
<line>As they were living. Think you see them great,</line>
<line>And follow&#8217;d with the general throng and sweat</line>
<line>Of thousand friends; then, in a moment, see</line>
<line>How soon this mightiness meets misery;</line>
<line>And if you can be merry then, I&#8217;ll say</line>
<line>A man may weep upon his wedding-day.</line>

<scenelocation>London. An ante-chamber in the palace.</scenelocation>
<scenepersonae>(Duke of Norfolk, Duke of Buckingham, Lord Abergavenny, Cardinal Wolsey, Guards, Secretaries, Brandon, Sergeant-at-Arms, Wolsey&#8217;s First Secretary)</scenepersonae>

<stagedir>Enter the Duke of Norfolk at one door; at the other, the Duke of Buckingham and the Lord Abergavenny.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>BUCK.</speaker>
<line>Good morrow, and well met. How have ye done</line>
<line>Since last we saw in France?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NOR.</speaker>
<line offset="6">I thank your Grace:</line>
<line>Healthful, and ever since a fresh admirer</line>
<line>Of what I saw there.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BUCK.</speaker>
<line offset="4">An untimely ague</line>
<line>Stay&#8217;d me a prisoner in my chamber when</line>
<line>Those suns of glory, those two lights of men,</line>
<line>Met in the vale of Andren.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NOR.</speaker>
<line offset="5">&#8217;Twixt Guynes and Arde&#8212;</line>
<line>I was then present, saw them salute on horseback,</line>
<line>Beheld them when they lighted, how they clung</line>
<line>In their embracement, as they grew together,</line>
<line>Which had they, what four thron&#8217;d ones could have weigh&#8217;d</line>
<line>Such a compounded one?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BUCK.</speaker>
<line offset="5">All the whole time</line>
<line>I was my chamber&#8217;s prisoner.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NOR.</speaker>
<line offset="6">Then you lost</line>
<line>The view of earthly glory. Men might say</line>
<line>Till this time pomp was single, but now married</line>
<line>To one above itself. Each following day</line>
<line>Became the next day&#8217;s master, till the last</line>
<line>Made former wonders its. Today the French,</line>
<line>All clinquant, all in gold, like heathen gods,</line>
<line>Shone down the English; and, tomorrow, they</line>
<line>Made Britain India: every man that stood</line>
<line>Show&#8217;d like a mine. Their dwarfish pages were</line>
<line>As cherubins, all gilt; the madams too,</line>
<line>Not us&#8217;d to toil, did almost sweat to bear</line>
<line>The pride upon them, that their very labor</line>
<line>Was to them as a painting. Now this masque</line>
<line>Was cried incomparable; and th&#8217; ensuing night</line>
<line>Made it a fool and beggar. The two kings,</line>
<line>Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst,</line>
<line>As presence did present them: him in eye</line>
<line>Still him in praise, and being present both,</line>
<line>&#8217;Twas said they saw but one, and no discerner</line>
<line>Durst wag his tongue in censure. When these suns</line>
<line>(For so they phrase &#8217;em) by their heralds challeng&#8217;d</line>
<line>The noble spirits to arms, they did perform</line>
<line>Beyond thought&#8217;s compass, that former fabulous story,</line>
<line>Being now seen possible enough, got credit,</line>
<line>That Bevis was believ&#8217;d.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BUCK.</speaker>
<line offset="5">O, you go far.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NOR.</speaker>
<line>As I belong to worship and affect</line>
<line>In honor honesty, the tract of ev&#8217;ry thing</line>
<line>Would by a good discourser lose some life,</line>
<line>Which action&#8217;s self was tongue to. All was royal;</line>
<line>To the disposing of it nought rebell&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Order gave each thing view; the office did</line>
<line>Distinctly his full function.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BUCK.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Who did guide&#8212;</line>
<line>I mean, who set the body and the limbs</line>
<line>Of this great sport together, as you guess?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NOR.</speaker>
<line>One, certes, that promises no element</line>
<line>In such a business.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BUCK.</speaker>
<line offset="4">I pray you, who, my lord?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NOR.</speaker>
<line>All this was ord&#8217;red by the good discretion</line>
<line>Of the right reverend Cardinal of York.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BUCK.</speaker>
<line>The devil speed him! No man&#8217;s pie is freed</line>
<line>From his ambitious finger. What had he</line>
<line>To do in these fierce vanities? I wonder</line>
<line>That such a keech can with his very bulk</line>
<line>Take up the rays o&#8217; th&#8217; beneficial sun,</line>
<line>And keep it from the earth.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NOR.</speaker>
<line offset="6">Surely, sir,</line>
<line>There&#8217;s in him stuff that puts him to these ends;</line>
<line>For being not propp&#8217;d by ancestry, whose grace</line>
<line>Chalks successors their way, nor call&#8217;d upon</line>
<line>For high feats done to th&#8217; crown, neither allied</line>
<line>To eminent assistants, but spider-like</line>
<line>Out of his self-drawing web, &#8217;a gives us note</line>
<line>The force of his own merit makes his way&#8212;</line>
<line>A gift that heaven gives for him, which buys</line>
<line>A place next to the King.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ABER.</speaker>
<line offset="5">I cannot tell</line>
<line>What heaven hath given him&#8212;let some graver eye</line>
<line>Pierce into that&#8212;but I can see his pride</line>
<line>Peep through each part of him. Whence has he that?</line>
<line>If not from hell, the devil is a niggard,</line>
<line>Or has given all before, and he begins</line>
<line>A new hell in himself.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BUCK.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Why the devil,</line>
<line>Upon this French going out, took he upon him</line>
<line>(Without the privity o&#8217; th&#8217; King) t&#8217; appoint</line>
<line>Who should attend on him? He makes up the file</line>
<line>Of all the gentry; for the most part such</line>
<line>To whom as great a charge as little honor</line>
<line>He meant to lay upon; and his own letter,</line>
<line>The honorable Board of Council out,</line>
<line>Must fetch him in he papers.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ABER.</speaker>
<line offset="6">I do know</line>
<line>Kinsmen of mine, three at the least, that have</line>
<line>By this so sicken&#8217;d their estates, that never</line>
<line>They shall abound as formerly.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BUCK.</speaker>
<line offset="7">O, many</line>
<line>Have broke their backs with laying manors on &#8217;em</line>
<line>For this great journey. What did this vanity</line>
<line>But minister communication of</line>
<line>A most poor issue?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NOR.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Grievingly I think</line>
<line>The peace between the French and us not values</line>
<line>The cost that did conclude it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BUCK.</speaker>
<line offset="6">Every man,</line>
<line>After the hideous storm that follow&#8217;d, was</line>
<line>A thing inspir&#8217;d, and, not consulting, broke</line>
<line>Into a general prophecy: that this tempest,</line>
<line>Dashing the garment of this peace, aboded</line>
<line>The sudden breach on&#8217;t.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NOR.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Which is budded out,</line>
<line>For France hath flaw&#8217;d the league, and hath attach&#8217;d</line>
<line>Our merchants&#8217; goods at Burdeaux.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ABER.</speaker>
<line offset="7">Is it therefore</line>
<line>Th&#8217; ambassador is silenc&#8217;d?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NOR.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Marry, is&#8217;t.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ABER.</speaker>
<line>A proper title of a peace, and purchas&#8217;d</line>
<line>At a superfluous rate!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BUCK.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Why, all this business</line>
<line>Our reverend Cardinal carried.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NOR.</speaker>
<line offset="6">Like it your Grace,</line>
<line>The state takes notice of the private difference</line>
<line>Betwixt you and the Cardinal. I advise you</line>
<line>(And take it from a heart that wishes towards you</line>
<line>Honor and plenteous safety) that you read</line>
<line>The Cardinal&#8217;s malice and his potency</line>
<line>Together; to consider further, that</line>
<line>What his high hatred would effect wants not</line>
<line>A minister in his power. You know his nature,</line>
<line>That he&#8217;s revengeful; and I know his sword</line>
<line>Hath a sharp edge; it&#8217;s long, and&#8217;t may be said</line>
<line>It reaches far, and where &#8217;twill not extend,</line>
<line>Thither he darts it. Bosom up my counsel,</line>
<line>You&#8217;ll find it wholesome. Lo, where comes that rock</line>
<line>That I advise your shunning.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Cardinal Wolsey, the purse borne before him, certain of the Guard, and two Secretaries with papers. The Cardinal in his passage fixeth his eye an Buckingham, and Buckingham on him, both full of disdain.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>WOL.</speaker>
<line>The Duke of Buckingham&#8217;s surveyor? Ha?</line>
<line>Where&#8217;s his examination?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. WOL. SECR.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Here, so please you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WOL.</speaker>
<line>Is he in person ready?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. WOL. SECR.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Ay, please your Grace.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WOL.</speaker>
<line>Well, we shall then know more, and Buckingham</line>
<line>Shall lessen this big look.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exeunt Cardinal and his Train.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>BUCK.</speaker>
<line>This butcher&#8217;s cur is venom&#8217;d-mouth&#8217;d, and I</line>
<line>Have not the power to muzzle him, therefore best</line>
<line>Not wake him in his slumber. A beggar&#8217;s book</line>
<line>Outworths a noble&#8217;s blood.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NOR.</speaker>
<line offset="5">What, are you chaf&#8217;d?</line>
<line>Ask God for temp&#8217;rance, that&#8217;s th&#8217; appliance only</line>
<line>Which your disease requires.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BUCK.</speaker>
<line offset="6">I read in &#8217;s looks</line>
<line>Matter against me, and his eye revil&#8217;d</line>
<line>Me as his abject object; at this instant</line>
<line>He bores me with some trick. He&#8217;s gone to th&#8217; King;</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll follow and outstare him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NOR.</speaker>
<line offset="6">Stay, my lord,</line>
<line>And let your reason with your choler question</line>
<line>What &#8217;tis you go about: to climb steep hills</line>
<line>Requires slow pace at first. Anger is like</line>
<line>A full hot horse, who being allow&#8217;d his way,</line>
<line>Self-mettle tires him. Not a man in England</line>
<line>Can advise me like you; be to yourself</line>
<line>As you would to your friend.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BUCK.</speaker>
<line offset="6">I&#8217;ll to the King,</line>
<line>And from a mouth of honor quite cry down</line>
<line>This Ipswich fellow&#8217;s insolence; or proclaim</line>
<line>There&#8217;s difference in no persons.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NOR.</speaker>
<line offset="7">Be advis&#8217;d;</line>
<line>Heat not a furnace for your foe so hot</line>
<line>That it do singe yourself. We may outrun</line>
<line>By violent swiftness that which we run at,</line>
<line>And lose by overrunning. Know you not</line>
<line>The fire that mounts the liquor till&#8217;t run o&#8217;er</line>
<line>In seeming to augment it wastes it? Be advis&#8217;d;</line>
<line>I say again, there is no English soul</line>
<line>More stronger to direct you than yourself,</line>
<line>If with the sap of reason you would quench,</line>
<line>Or but allay, the fire of passion.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BUCK.</speaker>
<line offset="7">Sir,</line>
<line>I am thankful to you, and I&#8217;ll go along</line>
<line>By your prescription; but this top-proud fellow,</line>
<line>Whom from the flow of gall I name not, but</line>
<line>From sincere motions, by intelligence,</line>
<line>And proofs as clear as founts in July when</line>
<line>We see each grain of gravel, I do know</line>
<line>To be corrupt and treasonous.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NOR.</speaker>
<line offset="6">Say not treasonous.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BUCK.</speaker>
<line>To th&#8217; King I&#8217;ll say&#8217;t, and make my vouch as strong</line>
<line>As shore of rock. Attend. This holy fox,</line>
<line>Or wolf, or both (for he is equal rav&#8217;nous</line>
<line>As he is subtile, and as prone to mischief</line>
<line>As able to perform&#8217;t), his mind and place</line>
<line>Infecting one another, yea, reciprocally,</line>
<line>Only to show his pomp as well in France</line>
<line>As here at home, suggests the King our master</line>
<line>To this last costly treaty&#8212;th&#8217; interview</line>
<line>That swallowed so much treasure, and like a glass</line>
<line>Did break i&#8217; th&#8217; wrenching.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NOR.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Faith, and so it did.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BUCK.</speaker>
<line>Pray give me favor, sir: this cunning Cardinal</line>
<line>The articles o&#8217; th&#8217; combination drew</line>
<line>As himself pleas&#8217;d; and they were ratified</line>
<line>As he cried, &#8220;Thus let be!&#8221; to as much end</line>
<line>As give a crutch to th&#8217; dead. But our count-cardinal</line>
<line>Has done this, and &#8217;tis well; for worthy Wolsey</line>
<line>(Who cannot err), he did it. Now this follows</line>
<line>(Which, as I take it, is a kind of puppy</line>
<line>To th&#8217; old dam, treason), Charles the Emperor,</line>
<line>Under pretense to see the Queen his aunt</line>
<line>(For &#8217;twas indeed his color, but he came</line>
<line>To whisper Wolsey), here makes visitation&#8212;</line>
<line>His fears were that the interview betwixt</line>
<line>England and France might through their amity</line>
<line>Breed him some prejudice; for from this league</line>
<line>Peep&#8217;d harms that menac&#8217;d him&#8212;privily</line>
<line>Deals with our Cardinal, and, as I trow&#8212;</line>
<line>Which I do well, for I am sure the Emperor</line>
<line>Paid ere he promis&#8217;d, whereby his suit was granted</line>
<line>Ere it was ask&#8217;d&#8212;but when the way was made</line>
<line>And pav&#8217;d with gold, the Emperor thus desir&#8217;d,</line>
<line>That he would please to alter the King&#8217;s course,</line>
<line>And break the foresaid peace. Let the King know</line>
<line>(As soon he shall by me) that thus the Cardinal</line>
<line>Does buy and sell his honor as he pleases,</line>
<line>And for his own advantage.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NOR.</speaker>
<line offset="6">I am sorry</line>

<line>Of all their loyalties; wherein, although,</line>
<line>My good Lord Cardinal, they vent reproaches</line>
<line>Most bitterly on you as putter-on</line>
<line>Of these exactions, yet the King our master&#8212;</line>
<line>Whose honor heaven shield from soil!&#8212;even he escapes not</line>
<line>Language unmannerly; yea, such which breaks</line>
<line>The sides of loyalty, and almost appears</line>
<line>In loud rebellion.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NOR.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Not almost appears,</line>
<line>It doth appear; for, upon these taxations,</line>
<line>The clothiers all, not able to maintain</line>
<line>The many to them &#8217;longing, have put off</line>
<line>The spinsters, carders, fullers, weavers, who,</line>
<line>Unfit for other life, compell&#8217;d by hunger</line>
<line>And lack of other means, in desperate manner</line>
<line>Daring th&#8217; event to th&#8217; teeth, are all in uproar,</line>
<line>And danger serves among them.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<line offset="7">Taxation?</line>
<line>Wherein? And what taxation? My Lord Cardinal,</line>
<line>You that are blam&#8217;d for it alike with us,</line>
<line>Know you of this taxation?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WOL.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Please you, sir,</line>
<line>I know but of a single part in aught</line>
<line>Pertains to th&#8217; state; and front but in that file</line>
<line>Where others tell steps with me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. KATH.</speaker>
<line offset="7">No, my lord?</line>
<line>You know no more than others? But you frame</line>
<line>Things that are known alike, which are not wholesome</line>
<line>To those which would not know them, and yet must</line>
<line>Perforce be their acquaintance. These exactions</line>
<line>(Whereof my sovereign would have note), they are</line>
<line>Most pestilent to th&#8217; hearing, and, to bear &#8217;em,</line>
<line>The back is sacrifice to th&#8217; load. They say</line>
<line>They are devis&#8217;d by you, or else you suffer</line>
<line>Too hard an exclamation.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Still exaction!</line>
<line>The nature of it? In what kind, let&#8217;s know,</line>
<line>Is this exaction?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. KATH.</speaker>
<line offset="4">I am much too venturous</line>
<line>In tempting of your patience; but am bold&#8217;ned</line>
<line>Under your promis&#8217;d pardon. The subject&#8217;s grief</line>
<line>Comes through commissions, which compels from each</line>
<line>The sixt part of his substance, to be levied</line>
<line>Without delay; and the pretense for this</line>
<line>Is nam&#8217;d, your wars in France. This makes bold mouths,</line>
<line>Tongues spit their duties out, and cold hearts freeze</line>
<line>Allegiance in them; their curses now</line>
<line>Live where their prayers did; and it&#8217;s come to pass</line>
<line>This tractable obedience is a slave</line>
<line>To each incensed will. I would your Highness</line>
<line>Would give it quick consideration, for</line>
<line>There is no primer baseness.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<line offset="6">By my life,</line>
<line>This is against our pleasure.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WOL.</speaker>
<line offset="5">And for me,</line>
<line>I have no further gone in this than by</line>
<line>A single voice, and that not pass&#8217;d me but</line>
<line>By learned approbation of the judges. If I am</line>
<line>Traduc&#8217;d by ignorant tongues, which neither know</line>
<line>My faculties nor person, yet will be</line>
<line>The chronicles of my doing, let me say</line>
<line>&#8217;Tis but the fate of place, and the rough brake</line>
<line>That virtue must go through. We must not stint</line>
<line>Our necessary actions in the fear</line>
<line>To cope malicious censurers, which ever,</line>
<line>As rav&#8217;nous fishes, do a vessel follow</line>
<line>That is new trimm&#8217;d, but benefit no further</line>
<line>Than vainly longing. What we oft do best,</line>
<line>By sick interpreters (once weak ones) is</line>
<line>Not ours, or not allow&#8217;d; what worst, as oft,</line>
<line>Hitting a grosser quality, is cried up</line>
<line>For our best act. If we shall stand still,</line>
<line>In fear our motion will be mock&#8217;d or carp&#8217;d at,</line>
<line>We should take root here where we sit, or sit</line>
<line>State-statues only.</line>

<line offset="4">Things done well</line>

<line>Things done without example, in their issue</line>

<line>Of this commission? I believe, not any.</line>
<line>We must not rend our subjects from our laws,</line>
<line>And stick them in our will. Sixth part of each?</line>
<line>A trembling contribution! Why, we take</line>
<line>From every tree, lop, bark, and part o&#8217; th&#8217; timber;</line>
<line>And, though we leave it with a root, thus hack&#8217;d,</line>
<line>The air will drink the sap. To every county</line>
<line>Where this is question&#8217;d send our letters, with</line>
<line>Free pardon to each man that has denied</line>

<speech>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<line offset="5">It grieves many.</line>
<line>The gentleman is learn&#8217;d, and a most rare speaker,</line>
<line>To nature none more bound; his training such</line>
<line>That he may furnish and instruct great teachers</line>
<line>And never seek for aid out of himself. Yet see,</line>
<line>When these so noble benefits shall prove</line>
<line>Not well dispos&#8217;d, the mind growing once corrupt,</line>
<line>They turn to vicious forms, ten times more ugly</line>
<line>Than ever they were fair. This man so complete,</line>
<line>Who was enroll&#8217;d &#8217;mongst wonders, and when we,</line>
<line>Almost with ravish&#8217;d list&#8217;ning, could not find</line>
<line>His hour of speech a minute&#8212;he, my lady,</line>
<line>Hath into monstrous habits put the graces</line>
<line>That once were his, and is become as black</line>
<line>As if besmear&#8217;d in hell. Sit by us, you shall hear</line>
<line>(This was his gentleman in trust) of him</line>
<line>Things to strike honor sad. Bid him recount</line>
<line>The fore-recited practices, whereof</line>
<line>We cannot feel too little, hear too much.</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BUCK. SURV.</speaker>
<line>First, it was usual with him&#8212;every day</line>
<line>It would infect his speech&#8212;that if the King</line>
<line>Should without issue die, he&#8217;ll carry it so</line>
<line>To make the sceptre his. These very words</line>
<line>I&#8217;ve heard him utter to his son-in-law,</line>
<line>Lord Aburga&#8217;ny, to whom by oath he menac&#8217;d</line>
<line>Revenge upon the Cardinal.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WOL.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Please your Highness note</line>
<line>This dangerous conception in this point,</line>
<line>Not friended by his wish, to your high person;</line>

<speech>
<speaker>BUCK. SURV.</speaker>
<line>Not long before your Highness sped to France,</line>
<line>The Duke being at the Rose, within the parish</line>
<line>Saint Lawrence Poultney, did of me demand</line>
<line>What was the speech among the Londoners</line>
<line>Concerning the French journey. I replied,</line>
<line>Men fear the French would prove perfidious,</line>
<line>To the King&#8217;s danger. Presently the Duke</line>
<line>Said, &#8217;twas the fear indeed, and that he doubted</line>
<line>&#8217;Twould prove the verity of certain words</line>
<line>Spoke by a holy monk &#8220;that oft,&#8221; says he,</line>
<line>&#8220;Hath sent to me, wishing me to permit</line>
<line>John de la Car, my chaplain, a choice hour</line>
<line>To hear from him a matter of some moment;</line>
<line>Whom after under the confession&#8217;s seal</line>
<line>He solemnly had sworn that what he spoke</line>
<line>My chaplain to no creature living but</line>
<line>To me should utter, with demure confidence</line>
<line>This pausingly ensu&#8217;d: &#8216;Neither the King nor &#8217;s heirs</line>
<line>(Tell you the Duke) shall prosper. Bid him strive</line>
<line>To the love o&#8217; th&#8217; commonalty; the Duke</line>
<line>Shall govern England.&#8217;&#8221;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. KATH.</speaker>
<line offset="5">If I know you well,</line>
<line>You were the Duke&#8217;s surveyor, and lost your office</line>
<line>On the complaint o&#8217; th&#8217; tenants. Take good heed</line>
<line>You charge not in your spleen a noble person</line>

<speaker>BUCK. SURV.</speaker>
<line offset="3">On my soul, I&#8217;ll speak but truth.</line>
<line>I told my lord the Duke, by th&#8217; devil&#8217;s illusions</line>
<line>The monk might be deceiv&#8217;d, and that &#8217;twas dangerous for him</line>
<line>To ruminate on this so far, until</line>
<line>It forg&#8217;d him some design, which being believ&#8217;d,</line>
<line>It was much like to do. He answer&#8217;d, &#8220;Tush,</line>
<line>It can do me no damage&#8221;; adding further</line>
<line>That had the King in his last sickness fail&#8217;d,</line>
<line>The Cardinal&#8217;s and Sir Thomas Lovell&#8217;s heads</line>
<line>Should have gone off.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>1. GENT.</speaker>
<line>Whither away so fast?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. GENT.</speaker>
<line offset="5">O, God save ye!</line>
<line>Ev&#8217;n to the hall, to hear what shall become</line>
<line>Of the great Duke of Buckingham.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. GENT.</speaker>
<line offset="7">I&#8217;ll save you</line>
<line>That labor, sir. All&#8217;s now done but the ceremony</line>
<line>Of bringing back the prisoner.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. GENT.</speaker>
<line offset="6">Were you there?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. GENT.</speaker>
<line>Yes indeed was I.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. GENT.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Pray speak what has happen&#8217;d.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. GENT.</speaker>
<line>You may guess quickly what.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. GENT.</speaker>
<line offset="6">Is he found guilty?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. GENT.</speaker>
<line>Yes, truly is he, and condemn&#8217;d upon&#8217;t.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. GENT.</speaker>
<line>I am sorry for&#8217;t.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. GENT.</speaker>
<line offset="3">So are a number more.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. GENT.</speaker>
<line>But pray how pass&#8217;d it?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. GENT.</speaker>
<line>I&#8217;ll tell you in a little. The great Duke</line>
<line>Came to the bar; where to his accusations</line>
<line>He pleaded still not guilty, and alleged</line>
<line>Many sharp reasons to defeat the law.</line>
<line>The King&#8217;s attorney on the contrary</line>
<line>Urg&#8217;d on the examinations, proofs, confessions</line>
<line>Of divers witnesses, which the Duke desir&#8217;d</line>
<line>To him brought <latin xml:lang="la">viv&#226; voce</latin> to his face;</line>
<line>At which appear&#8217;d against him his surveyor,</line>
<line>Sir Gilbert Perk his chancellor, and John Car,</line>
<line>Confessor to him, with that devil monk,</line>
<line>Hopkins, that made this mischief.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. GENT.</speaker>
<line offset="7">That was he</line>
<line>That fed him with his prophecies?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. GENT.</speaker>
<line offset="7">The same;</line>
<line>All these accus&#8217;d him strongly, which he fain</line>
<line>Would have flung from him; but indeed he could not.</line>
<line>And so his peers upon this evidence</line>
<line>Have found him guilty of high treason. Much</line>
<line>He spoke, and learnedly, for life; but all</line>
<line>Was either pitied in him or forgotten.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. GENT.</speaker>
<line>After all this, how did he bear himself?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. GENT.</speaker>
<line>When he was brought again to th&#8217; bar, to hear</line>
<line>His knell rung out, his judgment, he was stirr&#8217;d</line>
<line>With such an agony he sweat extremely,</line>
<line>And something spoke in choler, ill, and hasty.</line>
<line>But he fell to himself again, and sweetly</line>
<line>In all the rest show&#8217;d a most noble patience.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. GENT.</speaker>
<line>I do not think he fears death.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. GENT.</speaker>
<line offset="6">Sure he does not,</line>
<line>He never was so womanish. The cause</line>
<line>He may a little grieve at.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. GENT.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Certainly</line>
<line>The Cardinal is the end of this.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. GENT.</speaker>
<line offset="7">&#8217;Tis likely,</line>
<line>By all conjectures: first, Kildare&#8217;s attendure,</line>
<line>Then deputy of Ireland, who remov&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Earl Surrey was sent thither, and in haste too,</line>
<line>Lest he should help his father.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. GENT.</speaker>
<line offset="6">That trick of state</line>
<line>Was a deep envious one.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. GENT.</speaker>
<line offset="5">At his return</line>
<line>No doubt he will requite it. This is noted,</line>
<line>And generally, whoever the King favors,</line>
<line>The Card&#8217;nal instantly will find employment,</line>
<line>And far enough from court too.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. GENT.</speaker>
<line offset="7">All the commons</line>
<line>Hate him perniciously, and, o&#8217; my conscience,</line>
<line>Wish him ten fathom deep. This duke as much</line>
<line>They love and dote on; call him bounteous Buckingham,</line>
<line>The mirror of all courtesy&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Buckingham from his arraignment, Tipstaves before him, the axe with the edge towards him, Halberds on each side; accompanied with Sir Thomas Lovell, Sir Nicholas Vaux, Sir Walter Sands, and common people, etc.</stagedir>

<line offset="5">Stay there, sir,</line>
<line>And see the noble ruin&#8217;d man you speak of.</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BUCK.</speaker>
<line offset="7">All good people,</line>
<line>You that thus far have come to pity me,</line>
<line>Hear what I say, and then go home and lose me.</line>
<line>I have this day receiv&#8217;d a traitor&#8217;s judgment,</line>
<line>And by that name must die; yet, heaven bear witness,</line>
<line>And if I have a conscience, let it sink me,</line>
<line>Even as the axe falls, if I be not faithful!</line>
<line>The law I bear no malice for my death;</line>
<line>&#8217;T has done, upon the premises, but justice;</line>
<line>But those that sought it I could wish more Christians.</line>
<line>Be what they will, I heartily forgive &#8217;em;</line>
<line>Yet let &#8217;em look they glory not in mischief,</line>
<line>Nor build their evils on the graves of great men,</line>
<line>For then my guiltless blood must cry against &#8217;em.</line>
<line>For further life in this world I ne&#8217;er hope,</line>
<line>Nor will I sue, although the King have mercies</line>
<line>More than I dare make faults. You few that lov&#8217;d me</line>
<line>And dare be bold to weep for Buckingham,</line>
<line>His noble friends and fellows, whom to leave</line>
<line>Is only bitter to him, only dying,</line>
<line>Go with me like good angels to my end,</line>
<line>And as the long divorce of steel falls on me,</line>
<line>Make of your prayers one sweet sacrifice,</line>
<line>And lift my soul to heaven. Lead on a&#8217; God&#8217;s name.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LOV.</speaker>
<line>I do beseech your Grace, for charity,</line>
<line>If ever any malice in your heart</line>
<line>Were hid against me, now to forgive me frankly.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BUCK.</speaker>
<line>Sir Thomas Lovell, I as free forgive you</line>
<line>As I would be forgiven. I forgive all.</line>
<line>There cannot be those numberless offenses</line>
<line>&#8217;Gainst me, that I cannot take peace with; no black envy</line>
<line>Shall make my grave. Commend me to his Grace;</line>
<line>And if he speak of Buckingham, pray tell him</line>
<line>You met him half in heaven. My vows and prayers</line>
<line>Yet are the King&#8217;s; and, till my soul forsake,</line>
<line>Shall cry for blessings on him. May he live</line>
<line>Longer than I have time to tell his years;</line>
<line>Ever belov&#8217;d and loving may his rule be;</line>
<line>And when old Time shall lead him to his end,</line>
<line>Goodness and he fill up one monument!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LOV.</speaker>
<line>To th&#8217; water side I must conduct your Grace;</line>
<line>Then give my charge up to Sir Nicholas Vaux,</line>
<line>Who undertakes you to your end.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAUX.</speaker>
<line offset="7">Prepare there,</line>
<line>The Duke is coming. See the barge be ready;</line>
<line>And fit it with such furniture as suits</line>
<line>The greatness of his person.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BUCK.</speaker>
<line offset="6">Nay, Sir Nicholas,</line>
<line>Let it alone; my state now will but mock me.</line>
<line>When I came hither, I was Lord High Constable</line>
<line>And Duke of Buckingham; now, poor Edward Bohun.</line>
<line>Yet I am richer than my base accusers,</line>
<line>That never knew what truth meant. I now seal it;</line>
<line>And with that blood will make &#8217;em one day groan for&#8217;t.</line>
<line>My noble father, Henry of Buckingham,</line>
<line>Who first rais&#8217;d head against usurping Richard,</line>
<line>Flying for succor to his servant Banister,</line>
<line>Being distress&#8217;d, was by that wretch betray&#8217;d,</line>
<line>And without trial fell; God&#8217;s peace be with him!</line>
<line>Henry the Seventh succeeding, truly pitying</line>
<line>My father&#8217;s loss, like a most royal prince</line>
<line>Restor&#8217;d me to my honors; and out of ruins</line>
<line>Made my name once more noble. Now his son,</line>
<line>Henry the Eight, life, honor, name, and all</line>
<line>That made me happy, at one stroke has taken</line>
<line>Forever from the world. I had my trial,</line>
<line>And must needs say a noble one; which makes me</line>
<line>A little happier than my wretched father.</line>
<line>Yet thus far we are one in fortunes: both</line>
<line>Fell by our servants, by those men we lov&#8217;d most;</line>
<line>A most unnatural and faithless service.</line>
<line>Heaven has an end in all; yet, you that hear me,</line>
<line>This from a dying man receive as certain:</line>
<line>Where you are liberal of your loves and counsels,</line>
<line>Be sure you be not loose; for those you make friends</line>
<line>And give your hearts to, when they once perceive</line>
<line>The least rub in your fortunes, fall away</line>
<line>Like water from ye, never found again</line>
<line>But where they mean to sink ye. All good people,</line>
<line>Pray for me! I must now forsake ye. The last hour</line>
<line>Of my long weary life is come upon me.</line>
<line>Farewell!</line>
<line>And when you would say something that is sad,</line>
<line>Speak how I fell. I have done; and God forgive me!</line>

<line>A buzzing of a separation</line>
<line>Between the King and Katherine?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. GENT.</speaker>
<line offset="7">Yes, but it held not;</line>
<line>For when the King once heard it, out of anger</line>
<line>He sent command to the Lord Mayor straight</line>
<line>To stop the rumor, and allay those tongues</line>
<line>That durst disperse it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. GENT.</speaker>
<line offset="5">But that slander, sir,</line>
<line>Is found a truth now; for it grows again</line>
<line>Fresher than e&#8217;er it was, and held for certain</line>
<line>The King will venture at it. Either the Cardinal,</line>
<line>Or some about him near, have out of malice</line>
<line>To the good Queen possess&#8217;d him with a scruple</line>
<line>That will undo her. To confirm this too,</line>
<line>Cardinal Campeius is arriv&#8217;d, and lately,</line>
<line>As all think, for this business.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. GENT.</speaker>
<line offset="6">&#8217;Tis the Cardinal;</line>
<line>And merely to revenge him on the Emperor</line>
<line>For not bestowing on him at his asking</line>
<line>The archbishopric of Toledo, this is purpos&#8217;d.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. GENT.</speaker>
<line>I think you have hit the mark; but is&#8217;t not cruel.</line>
<line>That she should feel the smart of this? The Cardinal</line>

<line>&#8220;My lord, the horses your lordship sent for, with all the care I had, I saw well chosen, ridden, and furnish&#8217;d. They were young and handsome, and of the best breed in the north. When they were ready to set out for London, a man of my Lord Cardinal&#8217;s, by commission and main power, took &#8217;em from me, with this reason: his master would be serv&#8217;d before a subject, if not before the King, which stopp&#8217;d our mouths, sir.&#8221;</line>
<line>I fear he will indeed. Well, let him have them:</line>
<line>He will have all, I think.</line>

<line offset="5">I left him private,</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NOR.</speaker>
<line offset="7">What&#8217;s the cause?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CHAM.</speaker>
<line>It seems the marriage with his brother&#8217;s wife</line>
<line>Has crept too near his conscience.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SUF.</speaker> <stagedir>Aside.</stagedir>
<line offset="7">No, his conscience</line>
<line>Has crept too near another lady.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NOR.</speaker>
<line offset="7">&#8217;Tis so;</line>
<line>This is the Cardinal&#8217;s doing. The king-cardinal,</line>
<line>That blind priest, like the eldest son of Fortune,</line>
<line>Turns what he list. The King will know him one day.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SUF.</speaker>
<line>Pray God he do, he&#8217;ll never know himself else.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NOR.</speaker>
<line>How holily he works in all his business!</line>
<line>And with what zeal! For now he has crack&#8217;d the league</line>
<line>Between us and the Emperor (the Queen&#8217;s great nephew),</line>
<line>He dives into the King&#8217;s soul, and there scatters</line>
<line>Dangers, doubts, wringing of the conscience,</line>
<line>Fears, and despairs, and all these for his marriage.</line>
<line>And out of all these to restore the King,</line>
<line>He counsels a divorce, a loss of her</line>
<line>That, like a jewel, has hung twenty years</line>
<line>About his neck, yet never lost her lustre;</line>
<line>Of her that loves him with that excellence</line>
<line>That angels love good men with; even of her</line>
<line>That when the greatest stroke of fortune falls</line>
<line>Will bless the King. And is not this course pious?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CHAM.</speaker>
<line>Heaven keep me from such counsel! &#8217;Tis most true</line>
<line>These news are every where; every tongue speaks &#8217;em,</line>
<line>And every true heart weeps for&#8217;t. All that dare</line>
<line>Look into these affairs see this main end,</line>
<line>The French king&#8217;s sister. Heaven will one day open</line>
<line>The King&#8217;s eyes, that so long have slept upon</line>
<line>This bold bad man.</line>

<speaker>NOR.</speaker>
<line>We had need pray,</line>

<line>If the King please; his curses and his blessings</line>
<line>Touch me alike; th&#8217; are breath I not believe in.</line>

<line>Who can be angry now? What envy reach you?</line>
<line>The Spaniard, tied by blood and favor to her,</line>

<line>The trial just and noble. All the clerks</line>

<line>They will not stick to say you envied him,</line>

<speech>
<speaker>WOL.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Heav&#8217;n&#8217;s peace be with him!</line>
<line>That&#8217;s Christian care enough. For living murmurers</line>
<line>There&#8217;s places of rebuke. He was a fool&#8212;</line>
<line>For he would needs be virtuous. That good fellow,</line>
<line>If I command him, follows my appointment;</line>

<stagedir>The Queen makes no answer, rises out of her chair, goes about the court, comes to the King, and kneels at his feet; then speaks.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. KATH.</speaker>
<line>Sir, I desire you do me right and justice,</line>
<line>And to bestow your pity on me; for</line>
<line>I am a most poor woman, and a stranger,</line>
<line>Born out of your dominions; having here</line>
<line>No judge indifferent, nor no more assurance</line>
<line>Of equal friendship and proceeding. Alas, sir!</line>
<line>In what have I offended you? What cause</line>
<line>Hath my behavior given to your displeasure,</line>
<line>That thus you should proceed to put me off,</line>
<line>And take your good grace from me? Heaven witness,</line>
<line>I have been to you a true and humble wife,</line>
<line>At all times to your will conformable;</line>
<line>Ever in fear to kindle your dislike,</line>
<line>Yea, subject to your countenance&#8212;glad, or sorry,</line>
<line>As I saw it inclin&#8217;d. When was the hour</line>
<line>I ever contradicted your desire?</line>
<line>Or made it not mine too? Or which of your friends</line>
<line>Have I not strove to love, although I knew</line>
<line>He were mine enemy? What friend of mine</line>
<line>That had to him deriv&#8217;d your anger did I</line>
<line>Continue in my liking? Nay, gave notice</line>
<line>He was from thence discharg&#8217;d? Sir, call to mind</line>
<line>That I have been your wife in this obedience</line>
<line>Upward of twenty years, and have been blest</line>
<line>With many children by you. If, in the course</line>
<line>And process of this time, you can report,</line>
<line>And prove it too, against mine honor aught&#8212;</line>
<line>My bond to wedlock or my love and duty,</line>
<line>Against your sacred person&#8212;in God&#8217;s name</line>
<line>Turn me away; and let the foul&#8217;st contempt</line>
<line>Shut door upon me, and so give me up</line>
<line>To the sharp&#8217;st kind of justice. Please you, sir,</line>
<line>The King your father was reputed for</line>
<line>A prince most prudent, of an excellent</line>
<line>And unmatch&#8217;d wit and judgment; Ferdinand,</line>
<line>My father, King of Spain, was reckon&#8217;d one</line>
<line>The wisest prince that there had reign&#8217;d by many</line>
<line>A year before. It is not to be question&#8217;d</line>
<line>That they had gather&#8217;d a wise council to them</line>
<line>Of every realm, that did debate this business,</line>
<line>Who deem&#8217;d our marriage lawful; wherefore I humbly</line>
<line>Beseech you, sir, to spare me, till I may</line>
<line>Be by my friends in Spain advis&#8217;d, whose counsel</line>
<line>I will implore. If not, i&#8217; th&#8217; name of God,</line>
<line>Your pleasure be fulfill&#8217;d!</line>

<speaker>Q. KATH.</speaker>
<line offset="8">Sir,</line>
<line>I am about to weep; but thinking that</line>
<line>We are a queen (or long have dream&#8217;d so), certain</line>
<line>The daughter of a king, my drops of tears</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll turn to sparks of fire.</line>

<line offset="5">Be patient yet.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. KATH.</speaker>
<line>I will, when you are humble; nay, before,</line>
<line>Or God will punish me. I do believe</line>
<line>(Induc&#8217;d by potent circumstances) that</line>
<line>You are mine enemy, and make my challenge</line>
<line>You shall not be my judge; for it is you</line>
<line>Have blown this coal betwixt my lord and me&#8212;</line>
<line>Which God&#8217;s dew quench! Therefore I say again,</line>
<line>I utterly abhor, yea, from my soul</line>
<line>Refuse you for my judge, whom, yet once more,</line>
<line>I hold my most malicious foe, and think not</line>
<line>At all a friend to truth.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WOL.</speaker>
<line offset="5">I do profess</line>
<line>You speak not like yourself, who ever yet</line>
<line>Have stood to charity, and display&#8217;d th&#8217; effects</line>
<line>Of disposition gentle, and of wisdom</line>
<line>O&#8217;ertopping woman&#8217;s pow&#8217;r. Madam, you do me wrong,</line>
<line>I have no spleen against you, nor injustice</line>
<line>For you or any. How far I have proceeded,</line>
<line>Or how far further shall, is warranted</line>
<line>By a commission from the consistory,</line>
<line>Yea, the whole consistory of Rome. You charge me</line>
<line>That I have blown this coal. I do deny it.</line>
<line>The King is present: if it be known to him</line>
<line>That I gainsay my deed, how may he wound,</line>
<line>And worthily, my falsehood! Yea, as much</line>
<line>As you have done my truth. If he know</line>
<line>That I am free of your report, he knows</line>
<line>I am not of your wrong. Therefore in him</line>
<line>It lies to cure me, and the cure is to</line>
<line>Remove these thoughts from you; the which before</line>
<line>His Highness shall speak in, I do beseech</line>
<line>You, gracious madam, to unthink your speaking</line>
<line>And to say so no more.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. KATH.</speaker>
<line offset="5">My lord, my lord,</line>
<line>I am a simple woman, much too weak</line>
<line>T&#8217; oppose your cunning. Y&#8217; are meek and humble-mouth&#8217;d,</line>
<line>You sign your place and calling, in full seeming,</line>
<line>With meekness and humility; but your heart</line>
<line>Is cramm&#8217;d with arrogancy, spleen, and pride.</line>
<line>You have, by fortune and his Highness&#8217; favors,</line>
<line>Gone slightly o&#8217;er low steps and now are mounted</line>
<line>Where pow&#8217;rs are your retainers, and your words</line>
<line>(Domestics to you) serve your will as&#8217;t please</line>
<line>Yourself pronounce their office. I must tell you,</line>
<line>You tender more your person&#8217;s honor than</line>
<line>Your high profession spiritual; that again</line>
<line>I do refuse you for my judge, and here,</line>
<line>Before you all, appeal unto the Pope,</line>
<line>To bring my whole cause &#8217;fore his Holiness,</line>
<line>And to be judg&#8217;d by him.</line>

<stagedir>She curtsies to the King and offers to depart.</stagedir>

<line>That man i&#8217; th&#8217; world who shall report he has</line>

<line offset="6">Most gracious sir,</line>
<line>In humblest manner I require your Highness</line>
<line>That it shall please you to declare, in hearing</line>
<line>Of all these ears (for, where I am robb&#8217;d and bound,</line>
<line>There must I be unloos&#8217;d, although not there</line>
<line>At once and fully satisfied), whether ever I</line>
<line>Did broach this business to your Highness, or</line>
<line>Laid any scruple in your way which might</line>
<line>Induce you to the question on&#8217;t? Or ever</line>
<line>Have to you, but with thanks to God for such</line>
<line>A royal lady, spake one the least word that might</line>
<line>Be to the prejudice of her present state,</line>
<line>Or touch of her good person?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<line offset="6">My Lord Cardinal,</line>
<line>I do excuse you; yea, upon mine honor,</line>
<line>I free you from&#8217;t. You are not to be taught</line>
<line>That you have many enemies, that know not</line>
<line>Why they are so, but, like to village curs,</line>
<line>Bark when their fellows do: by some of these</line>
<line>The Queen is put in anger. Y&#8217; are excus&#8217;d;</line>
<line>But will you be more justified? You ever</line>
<line>Have wish&#8217;d the sleeping of this business, never desir&#8217;d</line>
<line>It to be stirr&#8217;d; but oft have hind&#8217;red, oft,</line>
<line>The passages made toward it. On my honor,</line>
<line>I speak my good Lord Card&#8217;nal to this point,</line>
<line>And thus far clear him. Now, what mov&#8217;d me to&#8217;t,</line>
<line>I will be bold with time and your attention:</line>
<line>Then mark th&#8217; inducement. Thus it came; give heed to&#8217;t:</line>
<line>My conscience first receiv&#8217;d a tenderness,</line>
<line>Scruple, and prick, on certain speeches utter&#8217;d</line>
<line>By th&#8217; Bishop of Bayonne, then French embassador,</line>
<line>Who had been hither sent on the debating</line>
<line>A marriage &#8217;twixt the Duke of Orleance and</line>
<line>Our daughter Mary. I&#8217; th&#8217; progress of this business,</line>
<line>Ere a determinate resolution, he</line>
<line>(I mean the Bishop) did require a respite,</line>
<line>Wherein he might the King his lord advertise</line>
<line>Whether our daughter were legitimate,</line>
<line>Respecting this our marriage with the dowager,</line>
<line>Sometimes our brother&#8217;s wife. This respite shook</line>
<line>The bosom of my conscience, enter&#8217;d me,</line>
<line>Yea, with a spitting power, and made to tremble</line>
<line>The region of my breast, which forc&#8217;d such way,</line>
<line>That many maz&#8217;d considerings did throng</line>
<line>And press&#8217;d in with this caution. First, methought</line>
<line>I stood not in the smile of heaven, who had</line>
<line>Commanded nature, that my lady&#8217;s womb,</line>
<line>If it conceiv&#8217;d a male-child by me, should</line>
<line>Do no more offices of life to&#8217;t than</line>
<line>The grave does to th&#8217; dead; for her male issue</line>
<line>Or died where they were made, or shortly after</line>
<line>This world had air&#8217;d them. Hence I took a thought</line>
<line>This was a judgment on me, that my kingdom</line>
<line>(Well worthy the best heir o&#8217; th&#8217; world) should not</line>
<line>Be gladded in&#8217;t by me. Then follows, that</line>
<line>I weigh&#8217;d the danger which my realms stood in</line>
<line>By this my issue&#8217;s fail, and that gave to me</line>
<line>Many a groaning throe. Thus hulling in</line>
<line>The wild sea of my conscience, I did steer</line>
<line>Toward this remedy, whereupon we are</line>
<line>Now present here together: that&#8217;s to say,</line>
<line>I meant to rectify my conscience&#8212;which</line>
<line>I then did feel full sick, and yet not well&#8212;</line>
<line>By all the reverend fathers of the land</line>
<line>And doctors learn&#8217;d. First I began in private</line>
<line>With you, my Lord of Lincoln. You remember</line>
<line>How under my oppression I did reek</line>
<line>When I first mov&#8217;d you.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>LIN.</speaker>
<line offset="5">So please your Highness,</line>
<line>The question did at first so stagger me,</line>
<line>Bearing a state of mighty moment in&#8217;t</line>
<line>And consequence of dread, that I committed</line>
<line>The daring&#8217;st counsel which I had to doubt,</line>

<line>To make this present summons. Unsolicited</line>

<line>But by particular consent proceeded</line>
<line>Under your hands and seals. Therefore go on,</line>

<line>Of my alleged reasons, drives this forward.</line>

<line>Then makes him nothing. I must read this paper;</line>
<line>I fear, the story of his anger. &#8217;Tis so!</line>
<line>This paper has undone me. &#8217;Tis th&#8217; accompt</line>
<line>Of all that world of wealth I have drawn together</line>
<line>For mine own ends (indeed to gain the popedom</line>
<line>And fee my friends in Rome). O negligence!</line>
<line>Fit for a fool to fall by. What cross devil</line>
<line>Made me put this main secret in the packet</line>
<line>I sent the King? Is there no way to cure this?</line>
<line>No new device to beat this from his brains?</line>
<line>I know &#8217;twill stir him strongly; yet I know</line>
<line>A way, if it take right, in spite of fortune</line>
<line>Will bring me off again. What&#8217;s this? &#8220;To th&#8217; Pope&#8221;?</line>
<line>The letter, as I live, with all the business</line>
<line>I writ to &#8217;s Holiness. Nay then, farewell!</line>
<line>I have touch&#8217;d the highest point of all my greatness,</line>

<line>At length broke under me, and now has left me,</line>
<line>Weary and old with service, to the mercy</line>
<line>Of a rude stream that must forever hide me.</line>
<line>Vain pomp and glory of this world, I hate ye!</line>

<line>That sun, I pray, may never set! I have told him</line>
<line>What, and how true, thou art; he will advance thee.</line>
<line>Some little memory of me will stir him</line>

<line>Let&#8217;s dry our eyes; and thus far hear me, Cromwell,</line>
<line>And when I am forgotten, as I shall be,</line>
<line>And sleep in dull cold marble where no mention</line>
<line>Of me more must be heard of, say I taught thee;</line>
<line>Say Wolsey, that once trod the ways of glory,</line>
<line>And sounded all the depths and shoals of honor,</line>
<line>Found thee a way, out of his wrack, to rise in;</line>
<line>A sure and safe one, though thy master miss&#8217;d it.</line>
<line>Mark but my fall, and that that ruin&#8217;d me:</line>
<line>Cromwell, I charge thee, fling away ambition!</line>
<line>By that sin fell the angels; how can man then</line>

<line>Love thyself last, cherish those hearts that hate thee;</line>

<line offset="7">Marquess Dorset,</line>

<line>A bold brave gentleman. That should be</line>

<speaker>2. GENT.</speaker>
<line offset="7">Heaven bless thee!</line>
<stagedir>Looking on the Queen.</stagedir>
<line>Thou hast the sweetest face I ever look&#8217;d on.</line>
<line>Sir, as I have a soul, she is an angel;</line>
<line>Our king has all the Indies in his arms,</line>
<line>And more and richer, when he strains that lady.</line>
<line>I cannot blame his conscience.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. GENT.</speaker>
<line offset="6">They that bear</line>
<line>The cloth of honor over her, are four barons</line>
<line>Of the Cinque-Ports.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. GENT.</speaker>
<line>Those men are happy, and so are all are near her.</line>
<line>I take it, she that carries up the train</line>
<line>Is that old noble lady, Duchess of Norfolk.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. GENT.</speaker>
<line>It is, and all the rest are countesses.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>1. GENT.</speaker>
<line>God save you, sir! Where have you been broiling?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>3. GENT.</speaker>
<line>Among the crowd i&#8217; th&#8217; Abbey, where a finger</line>
<line>Could not be wedg&#8217;d in more. I am stifled</line>
<line>With the mere rankness of their joy.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. GENT.</speaker>
<line offset="7">You saw</line>
<line>The ceremony?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>3. GENT.</speaker>
<line offset="3">That I did.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. GENT.</speaker>
<line offset="5">How was it?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>3. GENT.</speaker>
<line>Well worth the seeing.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. GENT.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Good sir, speak it to us.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>3. GENT.</speaker>
<line>As well as I am able. The rich stream</line>
<line>Of lords and ladies, having brought the Queen</line>
<line>To a prepar&#8217;d place in the choir, fell off</line>
<line>A distance from her; while her Grace sate down</line>
<line>To rest a while, some half an hour or so,</line>
<line>In a rich chair of state, opposing freely</line>
<line>The beauty of her person to the people.</line>
<line>Believe me, sir, she is the goodliest woman</line>
<line>That ever lay by man&#8212;which when the people</line>
<line>Had the full view of, such a noise arose</line>
<line>As the shrouds make at sea in a stiff tempest,</line>
<line>As loud and to as many tunes. Hats, cloaks</line>
<line>(Doublets, I think) flew up, and had their faces</line>
<line>Been loose, this day they had been lost. Such joy</line>
<line>I never saw before. Great-bellied women,</line>
<line>That had not half a week to go, like rams</line>
<line>In the old time of war, would shake the press</line>
<line>And make &#8217;em reel before &#8217;em. No man living</line>
<line>Could say, &#8220;This is my wife&#8221; there, all were woven</line>
<line>So strangely in one piece.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. GENT.</speaker>
<line offset="5">But what follow&#8217;d?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>3. GENT.</speaker>
<line>At length her Grace rose, and with modest paces</line>
<line>Came to the altar, where she kneel&#8217;d, and saint-like</line>
<line>Cast her fair eyes to heaven, and pray&#8217;d devoutly;</line>
<line>Then rose again and bow&#8217;d her to the people;</line>
<line>When by the Archbishop of Canterbury</line>
<line>She had all the royal makings of a queen,</line>
<line>As holy oil, Edward Confessor&#8217;s crown,</line>
<line>The rod, and bird of peace, and all such emblems</line>
<line>Laid nobly on her; which perform&#8217;d, the choir,</line>
<line>With all the choicest music of the kingdom,</line>
<line>Together sung Te Deum. So she parted,</line>
<line>And with the same full state pac&#8217;d back again</line>
<line>To York-place, where the feast is held.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. GENT.</speaker>
<line offset="8">Sir,</line>
<line>You must no more call it York-place, that&#8217;s past;</line>
<line>For since the Cardinal fell that title&#8217;s lost.</line>
<line>&#8217;Tis now the King&#8217;s, and call&#8217;d Whitehall.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>3. GENT.</speaker>
<line offset="8">I know it;</line>
<line>But &#8217;tis so lately alter&#8217;d that the old name</line>
<line>Is fresh about me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. GENT.</speaker>
<line offset="4">What two reverend bishops</line>
<line>Were those that went on each side of the Queen?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>3. GENT.</speaker>
<line>Stokesly and Gardiner, the one of Winchester,</line>
<line>Newly preferr&#8217;d from the King&#8217;s secretary,</line>
<line>The other, London.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. GENT.</speaker>
<line offset="4">He of Winchester</line>
<line>Is held no great good lover of the Archbishop&#8217;s,</line>
<line>The virtuous Cranmer.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>3. GENT.</speaker>
<line offset="5">All the land knows that.</line>
<line>However, yet there is no great breach; when it comes,</line>
<line>Cranmer will find a friend will not shrink from him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. GENT.</speaker>
<line>Who may that be, I pray you?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>3. GENT.</speaker>
<line offset="6">Thomas Cromwell,</line>
<line>A man in much esteem with th&#8217; King, and truly</line>
<line>A worthy friend. The King has made him Master</line>
<line>O&#8217; th&#8217; Jewel House,</line>
<line>And one, already, of the Privy Council.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. GENT.</speaker>
<line>He will deserve more.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>3. GENT.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Yes, without all doubt.</line>
<line>Come, gentlemen, ye shall go my way, which</line>
<line>Is to th&#8217; court, and there ye shall be my guests;</line>
<line>Something I can command. As I walk thither,</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll tell ye more.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>GRIF.</speaker>
<line>How does your Grace?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker alias="Q. KATH.">KATH.</speaker>
<line offset="5">O Griffith, sick to death!</line>
<line>My legs like loaden branches bow to th&#8217; earth,</line>
<line>Willing to leave their burden. Reach a chair.</line>
<line>So; now, methinks, I feel a little ease.</line>
<line>Didst thou not tell me, Griffith, as thou ledst me,</line>
<line>That the great child of honor, Cardinal Wolsey,</line>
<line>Was dead?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GRIF.</speaker>
<line offset="2">Yes, madam; but I think your Grace,</line>
<line>Out of the pain you suffer&#8217;d, gave no ear to&#8217;t.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker alias="Q. KATH.">KATH.</speaker>
<line>Prithee, good Griffith, tell me how he died.</line>
<line>If well, he stepp&#8217;d before me happily</line>
<line>For my example.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GRIF.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Well, the voice goes, madam:</line>
<line>For after the stout Earl Northumberland</line>
<line>Arrested him at York, and brought him forward,</line>
<line>As a man sorely tainted, to his answer,</line>
<line>He fell sick suddenly and grew so ill</line>
<line>He could not sit his mule.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker alias="Q. KATH.">KATH.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Alas, poor man!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GRIF.</speaker>
<line>At last, with easy roads, he came to Leicester,</line>
<line>Lodg&#8217;d in the abbey; where the reverend abbot</line>
<line>With all his covent honorably receiv&#8217;d him;</line>
<line>To whom he gave these words; &#8220;O Father Abbot,</line>
<line>An old man, broken with the storms of state,</line>
<line>Is come to lay his weary bones among ye;</line>
<line>Give him a little earth for charity!&#8221;</line>
<line>So went to bed; where eagerly his sickness</line>
<line>Pursu&#8217;d him still, and three nights after this,</line>
<line>About the hour of eight, which he himself</line>
<line>Foretold should be his last, full of repentance,</line>
<line>Continual meditations, tears, and sorrows,</line>
<line>He gave his honors to the world again,</line>
<line>His blessed part to heaven, and slept in peace.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker alias="Q. KATH.">KATH.</speaker>
<line>So may he rest, his faults lie gently on him!</line>
<line>Yet thus far, Griffith, give me leave to speak him,</line>
<line>And yet with charity. He was a man</line>
<line>Of an unbounded stomach, ever ranking</line>
<line>Himself with princes; one that by suggestion</line>
<line>Tied all the kingdom. Simony was fair play;</line>
<line>His own opinion was his law. I&#8217; th&#8217; presence</line>
<line>He would say untruths, and be ever double</line>
<line>Both in his words and meaning. He was never</line>
<line>(But where he meant to ruin) pitiful.</line>
<line>His promises were, as he then was, mighty;</line>
<line>But his performance, as he is now, nothing.</line>
<line>Of his own body he was ill, and gave</line>
<line>The clergy ill example.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GRIF.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Noble madam,</line>
<line>Men&#8217;s evil manners live in brass, their virtues</line>
<line>We write in water. May it please your Highness</line>
<line>To hear me speak his good now?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker alias="Q. KATH.">KATH.</speaker>
<line offset="7">Yes, good Griffith,</line>
<line>I were malicious else.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GRIF.</speaker>
<line offset="4">This Cardinal,</line>
<line>Though from an humble stock, undoubtedly</line>
<line>Was fashion&#8217;d to much honor. From his cradle</line>
<line>He was a scholar, and a ripe and good one;</line>
<line>Exceeding wise, fair-spoken, and persuading;</line>
<line>Lofty and sour to them that lov&#8217;d him not,</line>
<line>But to those men that sought him, sweet as summer.</line>
<line>And though he were unsatisfied in getting</line>
<line>(Which was a sin), yet in bestowing, madam,</line>
<line>He was most princely: ever witness for him</line>
<line>Those twins of learning that he rais&#8217;d in you,</line>
<line>Ipswich and Oxford! One of which fell with him,</line>
<line>Unwilling to outlive the good that did it;</line>
<line>The other (though unfinish&#8217;d) yet so famous,</line>
<line>So excellent in art, and still so rising,</line>
<line>That Christendom shall ever speak his virtue.</line>
<line>His overthrow heap&#8217;d happiness upon him;</line>
<line>For then, and not till then, he felt himself,</line>
<line>And found the blessedness of being little;</line>
<line>And to add greater honors to his age</line>
<line>Than man could give him, he died fearing God.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker alias="Q. KATH.">KATH.</speaker>
<line>After my death I wish no other herald,</line>
<line>No other speaker of my living actions</line>
<line>To keep mine honor from corruption,</line>
<line>But such an honest chronicler as Griffith.</line>
<line>Whom I most hated living, thou hast made me,</line>
<line>With thy religious truth and modesty,</line>
<line>Now in his ashes honor. Peace be with him!</line>
<line>Patience, be near me still, and set me lower;</line>
<line>I have not long to trouble thee. Good Griffith,</line>
<line>Cause the musicians play me that sad note</line>
<line>I nam&#8217;d my knell, whilst I sit meditating</line>
<line>On that celestial harmony I go to.</line>

<stagedir>The Vision</stagedir>
<stagedir>Enter, solemnly tripping one after another, six personages, clad in white robes, wearing on their heads garlands of bays, and golden vizards on their faces, branches of bays or palm in their hands. They first congee unto her, then dance; and, at certain changes, the first two hold a spare garland over her head, at which the other four make reverend curtsies. Then the two that held the garland deliver the same to the other next two, who observe the same order in their changes, and holding the garland over her head; which done, they deliver the same garland to the last two, who likewise observe the same order; at which (as it were by inspiration) she makes (in her sleep) signs of rejoicing, and holdeth up her hands to heaven: and so in their dancing vanish, carrying the garland with them. The music continues.</stagedir>

<line>The model of our chaste loves, his young daughter&#8212;</line>
<line>The dews of heaven fall thick in blessings on her!&#8212;</line>
<line>Beseeching him to give her virtuous breeding&#8212;</line>
<line>She is young, and of a noble modest nature,</line>
<line>I hope she will deserve well&#8212;and a little</line>
<line>To love her for her mother&#8217;s sake that lov&#8217;d him</line>
<line>Heaven knows how dearly. My next poor petition</line>
<line>Is, that his noble Grace would have some pity</line>
<line>Upon my wretched women, that so long</line>
<line>Have follow&#8217;d both my fortunes faithfully,</line>
<line>Of which there is not one, I dare avow</line>
<line>(And now I should not lie), but will deserve,</line>
<line>For virtue and true beauty of the soul,</line>
<line>For honesty and decent carriage,</line>
<line>A right good husband (let him be a noble),</line>
<line>And sure those men are happy that shall have &#8217;em.</line>
<line>The last is for my men (they are the poorest,</line>
<line>But poverty could never draw &#8217;em from me),</line>
<line>That they may have their wages duly paid &#8217;em,</line>
<line>And something over to remember me by.</line>
<line>If heaven had pleas&#8217;d to have given me longer life</line>
<line>And able means, we had not parted thus.</line>
<line>These are the whole contents, and, good my lord,</line>
<line>By that you love the dearest in this world,</line>
<line>As you wish Christian peace to souls departed,</line>
<line>Stand these poor people&#8217;s friend, and urge the King</line>
<line>To do me this last right.</line>

<line>My lord. Griffith, farewell. Nay, Patience,</line>
<line>You must not leave me yet. I must to bed,</line>

<line>Let me be us&#8217;d with honor; strew me over</line>
<line>With maiden flowers, that all the world may know</line>
<line>I was a chaste wife to my grave. Embalm me,</line>

<line>I did, Sir Thomas, and left him at primero</line>
<line>With the Duke of Suffolk.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LOV.</speaker>
<line offset="5">I must to him too,</line>
<line>Before he go to bed. I&#8217;ll take my leave.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GARD.</speaker>
<line>Not yet, Sir Thomas Lovell. What&#8217;s the matter?</line>
<line>It seems you are in haste. And if there be</line>
<line>No great offense belongs to&#8217;t, give your friend</line>
<line>Some touch of your late business. Affairs that walk</line>
<line>(As they say spirits do) at midnight, have</line>
<line>In them a wilder nature than the business</line>
<line>That seeks dispatch by day.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LOV.</speaker>
<line offset="5">My lord, I love you;</line>
<line>And durst commend a secret to your ear</line>
<line>Much weightier than this work. The Queen&#8217;s in labor,</line>
<line>They say in great extremity, and fear&#8217;d</line>
<line>She&#8217;ll with the labor end.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GARD.</speaker>
<line offset="5">The fruit she goes with</line>
<line>I pray for heartily, that it may find</line>
<line>Good time, and live; but for the stock, Sir Thomas,</line>
<line>I wish it grubb&#8217;d up now.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LOV.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Methinks I could</line>
<line>Cry the amen, and yet my conscience says</line>
<line>She&#8217;s a good creature, and, sweet lady, does</line>
<line>Deserve our better wishes.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GARD.</speaker>
<line offset="5">But, sir, sir,</line>
<line>Hear me, Sir Thomas, y&#8217; are a gentleman</line>
<line>Of mine own way; I know you wise, religious,</line>
<line>And, let me tell you, it will ne&#8217;er be well&#8212;</line>
<line>&#8217;Twill not, Sir Thomas Lovell, take&#8217;t of me&#8212;</line>
<line>Till Cranmer, Cromwell, her two hands, and she</line>
<line>Sleep in their graves.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LOV.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Now, sir, you speak of two</line>
<line>The most remark&#8217;d i&#8217; th&#8217; kingdom. As for Cromwell,</line>
<line>Beside that of the Jewel House, is made Master</line>
<line>O&#8217; th&#8217; Rolls, and the King&#8217;s secretary; further, sir,</line>
<line>Stands in the gap and trade of more preferments,</line>
<line>With which the time will load him. Th&#8217; Archbishop</line>
<line>Is the King&#8217;s hand and tongue, and who dare speak</line>
<line>One syllable against him?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GARD.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Yes, yes, Sir Thomas,</line>
<line>There are that dare, and I myself have ventur&#8217;d</line>
<line>To speak my mind of him; and indeed this day,</line>
<line>Sir (I may tell it you), I think I have</line>
<line>Incens&#8217;d the lords o&#8217; th&#8217; Council that he is</line>
<line>(For so I know he is, they know he is)</line>
<line>A most arch-heretic, a pestilence</line>
<line>That does infect the land; with which they moved</line>
<line>Have broken with the King, who hath so far</line>
<line>Given ear to our complaint, of his great grace</line>
<line>And princely care foreseeing those fell mischiefs</line>
<line>Our reasons laid before him, &#8217;hath commanded</line>
<line>Tomorrow morning to the Council-board</line>
<line>He be convented. He&#8217;s a rank weed, Sir Thomas,</line>
<line>And we must root him out. From your affairs</line>
<line>I hinder you too long. Good night, Sir Thomas.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LOV.</speaker>
<line>Many good-nights, my lord! I rest your servant.</line>

<line>Now, Lovell, from the Queen what is the news?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LOV.</speaker>
<line>I could not personally deliver to her</line>
<line>What you commanded me, but by her woman</line>
<line>I sent your message, who return&#8217;d her thanks</line>
<line>In the great&#8217;st humbleness, and desir&#8217;d your Highness</line>
<line>Most heartily to pray for her.</line>
</speech>

<line offset="6">What say&#8217;st thou? Ha?</line>
<line>To pray for her? What, is she crying out?</line>

<line>So said her woman, and that her suff&#8217;rance made</line>

<line>Ah, my good lord, I grieve at what I speak,</line>
<line>And am right sorry to repeat what follows.</line>
<line>I have, and most unwillingly, of late</line>
<line>Heard many grievous&#8212;I do say, my lord,</line>
<line>Grievous&#8212;complaints of you; which, being consider&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Have mov&#8217;d us and our Council, that you shall</line>
<line>This morning come before us, where I know</line>
<line>You cannot with such freedom purge yourself,</line>
<line>But that till further trial, in those charges</line>
<line>Which will require your answer, you must take</line>
<line>Your patience to you, and be well contented</line>
<line>To make your house our Tow&#8217;r. You, a brother of us</line>

<line offset="5">I humbly thank your Highness,</line>

<line>If they shall fail, I, with mine enemies,</line>

<line>How your state stands i&#8217; th&#8217; world, with the whole world?</line>

<line>The justice and the truth o&#8217; th&#8217; question carries</line>
<line>The due o&#8217; th&#8217; verdict with it. At what ease</line>
<line>Might corrupt minds procure knaves as corrupt</line>
<line>To swear against you? Such things have been done.</line>
<line>You are potently oppos&#8217;d, and with a malice</line>
<line>Of as great size. Ween you of better luck,</line>

<line offset="5">Be of good cheer,</line>
<line>They shall no more prevail than we give way to.</line>
<line>Keep comfort to you, and this morning see</line>
<line>You do appear before them. If they shall chance,</line>

<line>The best persuasions to the contrary</line>
<line>Fail not to use, and with what vehemency</line>
<line>Th&#8217; occasion shall instruct you. If entreaties</line>

<line>He&#8217;s honest, on mine honor. God&#8217;s blest Mother!</line>

<line>Is this the honor they do one another?</line>
<line>&#8217;Tis well there&#8217;s one above &#8217;em yet. I had thought</line>
<line>They had parted so much honesty among &#8217;em&#8212;</line>
<line>At least good manners&#8212;as not thus to suffer</line>
<line>A man of his place, and so near our favor,</line>
<line>To dance attendance on their lordships&#8217; pleasures,</line>

<speech>
<speaker>CHAN.</speaker>
<line>My good Lord Archbishop, I&#8217;m very sorry</line>
<line>To sit here at this present, and behold</line>
<line>That chair stand empty; but we all are men,</line>
<line>In our own natures frail, and capable</line>
<line>Of our flesh; few are angels; out of which frailty</line>
<line>And want of wisdom, you, that best should teach us,</line>
<line>Have misdemean&#8217;d yourself, and not a little:</line>
<line>Toward the King first, then his laws, in filling</line>
<line>The whole realm by your teaching and your chaplains&#8217;</line>
<line>(For so we are inform&#8217;d) with new opinions,</line>
<line>Divers and dangerous; which are heresies,</line>
<line>And, not reform&#8217;d, may prove pernicious.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GARD.</speaker>
<line>Which reformation must be sudden too,</line>
<line>My noble lords; for those that tame wild horses</line>
<line>Pace &#8217;em not in their hands to make &#8217;em gentle,</line>
<line>But stop their mouths with stubborn bits and spur &#8217;em</line>
<line>Till they obey the manage. If we suffer,</line>
<line>Out of our easiness and childish pity</line>
<line>To one man&#8217;s honor, this contagious sickness,</line>
<line>Farewell all physic! And what follows then?</line>
<line>Commotions, uproars, with a general taint</line>
<line>Of the whole state; as of late days our neighbors,</line>
<line>The upper Germany, can dearly witness,</line>
<line>Yet freshly pitied in our memories.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CRAN.</speaker>
<line>My good lords: hitherto, in all the progress</line>
<line>Both of my life and office, I have labor&#8217;d,</line>
<line>And with no little study, that my teaching</line>
<line>And the strong course of my authority</line>
<line>Might go one way, and safely; and the end</line>
<line>Was ever to do well; nor is there living</line>
<line>(I speak it with a single heart, my lords)</line>
<line>A man that more detests, more stirs against,</line>
<line>Both in his private conscience and his place,</line>
<line>Defacers of a public peace than I do.</line>
<line>Pray heaven the King may never find a heart</line>
<line>With less allegiance in it! Men that make</line>
<line>Envy and crooked malice nourishment</line>
<line>Dare bite the best. I do beseech your lordships,</line>
<line>That, in this case of justice, my accusers,</line>
<line>Be what they will, may stand forth face to face,</line>
<line>And freely urge against me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SUF.</speaker>
<line offset="6">Nay, my lord,</line>
<line>That cannot be; you are a Councillor,</line>
<line>And by that virtue no man dare accuse you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GARD.</speaker>
<line>My lord, because we have business of more moment,</line>
<line>We will be short with you. &#8217;Tis his Highness&#8217; pleasure</line>
<line>And our consent, for better trial of you,</line>
<line>From hence you be committed to the Tower,</line>
<line>Where being but a private man again,</line>
<line>You shall know many dare accuse you boldly,</line>
<line>More than (I fear) you are provided for.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CRAN.</speaker>
<line>Ah, my good Lord of Winchester&#8212;I thank you,</line>
<line>You are always my good friend; if your will pass,</line>
<line>I shall both find your lordship judge and juror,</line>
<line>You are so merciful. I see your end,</line>
<line>&#8217;Tis my undoing. Love and meekness, lord,</line>
<line>Become a churchman better than ambition;</line>
<line>Win straying souls with modesty again,</line>
<line>Cast none away. That I shall clear myself,</line>
<line>Lay all the weight ye can upon my patience,</line>
<line>I make as little doubt as you do conscience</line>
<line>In doing daily wrongs. I could say more,</line>
<line>But reverence to your calling makes me modest.</line>
</speech>

<speech>

<line>My lord, my lord, you are a sectary,</line>
<line>That&#8217;s the plain truth. Your painted gloss discovers,</line>

<speech>
<speaker>CROM.</speaker>
<line>My Lord of Winchester, y&#8217; are a little,</line>
<line>By your good favor, too sharp; men so noble,</line>
<line>However faulty, yet should find respect</line>
<line>For what they have been. &#8217;Tis a cruelty</line>
<line>To load a falling man.</line>

<line offset="4">Good Master Secretary,</line>
<line>I cry your honor mercy; you may worst</line>

<line>Then thus for you, my lord, it stands agreed,</line>
<line>I take it, by all voices: that forthwith</line>
<line>You be convey&#8217;d to th&#8217; Tower a prisoner;</line>
<line>There to remain till the King&#8217;s further pleasure</line>

<line offset="6">Stay, good my lords,</line>
<line>I have a little yet to say. Look there, my lords;</line>
<line>By virtue of that ring, I take my cause</line>
<line>Out of the gripes of cruel men, and give it</line>

<stagedir>Enter King frowning on them; takes his seat.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>GARD.</speaker>
<line>Dread sovereign, how much are we bound to heaven</line>
<line>In daily thanks, that gave us such a prince,</line>
<line>Not only good and wise but most religious;</line>
<line>One that, in all obedience, makes the Church</line>
<line>The chief aim of his honor, and to strengthen</line>
<line>That holy duty, out of dear respect,</line>
<line>His royal self in judgment comes to hear</line>
<line>The cause betwixt her and this great offender.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<line>You were ever good at sudden commendations,</line>
<line>Bishop of Winchester. But know I come not</line>
<line>To hear such flattery now, and in my presence</line>
<line>They are too thin and base to hide offenses.</line>
<line>To me you cannot reach you play the spaniel,</line>
<line>And think with wagging of your tongue to win me;</line>
<line>But whatsoe&#8217;er thou tak&#8217;st me for, I&#8217;m sure</line>
<line>Thou hast a cruel nature and a bloody.</line>
<stagedir>To Crammer.</stagedir>
<line>Good man, sit down. Now let me see the proudest</line>
<line>He, that dares most, but wag his finger at thee.</line>
<line>By all that&#8217;s holy, he had better starve</line>
<line>Than but once think his place becomes thee not.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SUR.</speaker>
<line>May it please your Grace&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<line offset="5">No, sir, it does not please me.</line>
<line>I had thought I had had men of some understanding</line>
<line>And wisdom of my Council; but I find none.</line>
<line>Was it discretion, lords, to let this man,</line>
<line>This good man (few of you deserve that title),</line>
<line>This honest man, wait like a lousy footboy</line>
<line>At chamber-door? And one as great as you are?</line>
<line>Why, what a shame was this? Did my commission</line>
<line>Bid ye so far forget yourselves? I gave ye</line>
<line>Power as he was a Councillor to try him,</line>
<line>Not as a groom. There&#8217;s some of ye, I see,</line>
<line>More out of malice than integrity,</line>
<line>Would try him to the utmost had ye mean,</line>
<line>Which ye shall never have while I live.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CHAN.</speaker>
<line offset="8">Thus far,</line>
<line>My most dread sovereign, may it like your Grace</line>
<line>To let my tongue excuse all. What was purpos&#8217;d</line>
<line>Concerning his imprisonment was rather</line>
<line>(If there be faith in men) meant for his trial</line>
<line>And fair purgation to the world than malice,</line>
<line>I&#8217;m sure, in me.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<line offset="3">Well, well, my lords, respect him,</line>
<line>Take him, and use him well; he&#8217;s worthy of it.</line>
<line>I will say thus much for him, if a prince</line>
<line>May be beholding to a subject, I</line>
<line>Am for his love and service so to him.</line>
<line>Make me no more ado, but all embrace him.</line>
<line>Be friends, for shame, my lords! My Lord of Canterbury,</line>
<line>I have a suit which you must not deny me:</line>
<line>That is, a fair young maid that yet wants baptism,</line>
<line>You must be godfather, and answer for her.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CRAN.</speaker>
<line>The greatest monarch now alive may glory</line>
<line>In such an honor; how may I deserve it,</line>
<line>That am a poor and humble subject to you?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<line>Come, come, my lord, you&#8217;d spare your spoons. You shall have</line>
<line>Two noble partners with you, the old Duchess of Norfolk</line>
<line>And Lady Marquess Dorset. Will these please you?</line>
<line>Once more, my Lord of Winchester, I charge you,</line>

<line>Witness how dear I hold this confirmation.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<line>Good man, those joyful tears show thy true heart.</line>
<line>The common voice, I see, is verified</line>
<line>Of thee, which says thus, &#8220;Do my Lord of Canterbury</line>
<line>A shrewd turn, and he&#8217;s your friend forever.&#8221;</line>
<line>Come, lords, we trifle time away; I long</line>
<line>To have this young one made a Christian.</line>
<line>As I have made ye one, lords, one remain:</line>

<line>The spoons will be the bigger, sir. There is a fellow somewhat near the door, he should be a brazier by his face, for, o&#8217; my conscience, twenty of the dog-days now reign in &#8217;s nose; all that stand about him are under the line, they need no other penance: that fire-drake did I hit three times on the head, and three times was his nose discharg&#8217;d against me; he stands there like a mortar-piece to blow us. There was a haberdasher&#8217;s wife of small wit near him, that rail&#8217;d upon me till her pink&#8217;d porringer fell off her head, for kindling such a combustion in the state. I miss&#8217;d the meteor once, and hit that woman, who cried out &#8220;Clubs!&#8221; , when I might see from far some forty truncheoners draw to her succor, which were the hope o&#8217; th&#8217; Strond, where she was quarter&#8217;d. They fell on, I made good my place; at length they came to th&#8217; broom-staff to me, I defied &#8217;em still, when suddenly a file of boys behind &#8217;em, loose shot, deliver&#8217;d such a show&#8217;r of pibbles, that I was fain to draw mine honor in, and let &#8217;em win the work.

<line>&#8217;Tis ten to one this play can never please</line>

<line>They&#8217;ll say &#8217;tis naught; others to hear the city</line>
<line>Abus&#8217;d extremely, and to cry, &#8220;That&#8217;s witty!&#8221;</line>
<line>Which we have not done neither: that I fear</line>
<line>All the expected good w&#8217; are like to hear</line>
<line>For this play at this time, is only in</line>
<line>The merciful construction of good women,</line>
<line>For such a one we show&#8217;d &#8217;em. If they smile,</line>
<line>And say &#8217;twill do, I know within a while</line>
<line>All the best men are ours; for &#8217;tis ill hap</line>
<line>If they hold when their ladies bid &#8217;em clap.</line></speech>
