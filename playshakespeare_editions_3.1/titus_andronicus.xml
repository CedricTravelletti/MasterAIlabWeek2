<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SAT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Noble patricians, patrons of my right,</LINE>
<LINE>Defend the justice of my cause with arms;</LINE>
<LINE>And, countrymen, my loving followers,</LINE>
<LINE>Plead my successive title with your swords.</LINE>
<LINE>I am his first-born son, that was the last</LINE>
<LINE>That ware the imperial diadem of Rome,</LINE>
<LINE>Then let my father&#8217;s honors live in me,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor wrong mine age with this indignity.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Romans, friends, followers, favorers of my right,</LINE>
<LINE>If ever Bassianus, Caesar&#8217;s son,</LINE>
<LINE>Were gracious in the eyes of royal Rome,</LINE>
<LINE>Keep then this passage to the Capitol,</LINE>
<LINE>And suffer not dishonor to approach</LINE>
<LINE>The imperial seat, to virtue consecrate,</LINE>
<LINE>To justice, continence, and nobility;</LINE>
<LINE>But let desert in pure election shine,</LINE>
<LINE>And, Romans, fight for freedom in your choice.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARC.</SPEAKER>
<STAGEDIR>Holding the crown.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Princes, that strive by factions and by friends</LINE>
<LINE>Ambitiously for rule and empery,</LINE>
<LINE>Know that the people of Rome, for whom we stand</LINE>
<LINE>A special party, have by common voice,</LINE>
<LINE>In election for the Roman empery,</LINE>
<LINE>Chosen Andronicus, surnamed Pius</LINE>
<LINE>For many good and great deserts to Rome.</LINE>
<LINE>A nobler man, a braver warrior,</LINE>
<LINE>Lives not this day within the city walls.</LINE>
<LINE>He by the Senate is accited home</LINE>
<LINE>From weary wars against the barbarous Goths,</LINE>
<LINE>That with his sons, a terror to our foes,</LINE>
<LINE>Hath yok&#8217;d a nation strong, train&#8217;d up in arms.</LINE>
<LINE>Ten years are spent since first he undertook</LINE>
<LINE>This cause of Rome, and chastised with arms</LINE>
<LINE>Our enemies&#8217; pride; five times he hath return&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>Bleeding to Rome, bearing his valiant sons</LINE>
<LINE>In coffins from the field,</LINE>
<LINE>And now at last, laden with honor&#8217;s spoils,</LINE>
<LINE>Returns the good Andronicus to Rome,</LINE>
<LINE>Renowned Titus, flourishing in arms.</LINE>
<LINE>Let us entreat by honor of his name,</LINE>
<LINE>Whom worthily you would have now succeed,</LINE>
<LINE>And in the Capitol and Senate&#8217;s right,</LINE>
<LINE>Whom you pretend to honor and adore,</LINE>
<LINE>That you withdraw you, and abate your strength,</LINE>
<LINE>Dismiss your followers, and, as suitors should,</LINE>
<LINE>Plead your deserts in peace and humbleness.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SAT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How fair the tribune speaks to calm my thoughts!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marcus Andronicus, so I do affy</LINE>
<LINE>In thy uprightness and integrity,</LINE>
<LINE>And so I love and honor thee and thine,</LINE>
<LINE>Thy noble brother Titus and his sons,</LINE>
<LINE>And her to whom my thoughts are humbled all,</LINE>
<LINE>Gracious Lavinia, Rome&#8217;s rich ornament,</LINE>
<LINE>That I will here dismiss my loving friends;</LINE>
<LINE>And to my fortunes and the people&#8217;s favor</LINE>
<LINE>Commit my cause in balance to be weigh&#8217;d.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt Soldiers of Bassianus.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SAT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Friends, that have been thus forward in my right,</LINE>
<LINE>I thank you all and here dismiss you all,</LINE>
<LINE>And to the love and favor of my country</LINE>
<LINE>Commit myself, my person, and the cause.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt Soldiers of Saturninus.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Rome, be as just and gracious unto me</LINE>
<LINE>As I am confident and kind to thee.</LINE>
<LINE>Open the gates and let me in.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>BAS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tribunes, and me, a poor competitor.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Flourish. They go up into the Senate-house.</STAGEDIR>

<STAGEDIR>Enter a Roman Captain.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROM. CAP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Romans, make way! The good Andronicus,</LINE>
<LINE>Patron of virtue, Rome&#8217;s best champion,</LINE>
<LINE>Successful in the battles that he fights,</LINE>
<LINE>With honor and with fortune is return&#8217;d.</LINE>
<LINE>From where he circumscribed with his sword,</LINE>
<LINE>And brought to yoke, the enemies of Rome.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Sound drums and trumpets, and then enter two of Titus&#8217; sons Martius and Mutius; and then two Men bearing a coffin covered with black; then two other sons, Lucius and Quintus. Then Titus Andronicus; and then Tamora, the Queen of Goths, and her three sons Alarbus, Chiron, and Demetrius; with Aaron the Moor, and others as many as can be. Then set down the coffin, and Titus speaks.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hail, Rome, victorious in thy mourning weeds!</LINE>
<LINE>Lo, as the bark that hath discharg&#8217;d his fraught</LINE>
<LINE>Returns with precious lading to the bay</LINE>
<LINE>From whence at first she weigh&#8217;d her anchorage,</LINE>
<LINE>Cometh Andronicus, bound with laurel boughs,</LINE>
<LINE>To re-salute his country with his tears,</LINE>
<LINE>Tears of true joy for his return to Rome.</LINE>
<LINE>Thou great defender of this Capitol,</LINE>
<LINE>Stand gracious to the rites that we intend!</LINE>
<LINE>Romans, of five and twenty valiant sons,</LINE>
<LINE>Half of the number that King Priam had,</LINE>
<LINE>Behold the poor remains, alive and dead!</LINE>
<LINE>These that survive let Rome reward with love;</LINE>
<LINE>These that I bring unto their latest home,</LINE>
<LINE>With burial amongst their ancestors.</LINE>
<LINE>Here Goths have given me leave to sheathe my sword.</LINE>
<LINE>Titus, unkind and careless of thine own,</LINE>
<LINE>Why suffer&#8217;st thou thy sons, unburied yet,</LINE>
<LINE>To hover on the dreadful shore of Styx?</LINE>
<LINE>Make way to lay them by their bretheren.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>They open the tomb.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>There greet in silence, as the dead are wont,</LINE>
<LINE>And sleep in peace, slain in your country&#8217;s wars!</LINE>
<LINE>O sacred receptacle of my joys,</LINE>
<LINE>Sweet cell of virtue and nobility,</LINE>
<LINE>How many sons hast thou of mine in store,</LINE>
<LINE>That thou wilt never render to me more!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Give us the proudest prisoner of the Goths,</LINE>
<LINE>That we may hew his limbs and on a pile</LINE>
<LINE><LATIN lang="la">Ad manes fratrum</LATIN> sacrifice his flesh</LINE>
<LINE>Before this earthy prison of their bones,</LINE>
<LINE>That so the shadows be not unappeas&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor we disturb&#8217;d with prodigies on earth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I give him you, the noblest that survives,</LINE>
<LINE>The eldest son of this distressed queen.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Stay, Roman brethren! Gracious conqueror,</LINE>
<LINE>Victorious Titus, rue the tears I shed,</LINE>
<LINE>A mother&#8217;s tears in passion for her son;</LINE>
<LINE>And if thy sons were ever dear to thee,</LINE>
<LINE>O, think my son to be as dear to me!</LINE>
<LINE>Sufficeth not that we are brought to Rome</LINE>
<LINE>To beautify thy triumphs, and return</LINE>
<LINE>Captive to thee and to thy Roman yoke;</LINE>
<LINE>But must my sons be slaughtered in the streets</LINE>
<LINE>For valiant doings in their country&#8217;s cause?</LINE>
<LINE>O, if to fight for king and commonweal</LINE>
<LINE>Were piety in thine, it is in these.</LINE>
<LINE>Andronicus, stain not thy tomb with blood!</LINE>
<LINE>Wilt thou draw near the nature of the gods?</LINE>
<LINE>Draw near them then in being merciful:</LINE>
<LINE>Sweet mercy is nobility&#8217;s true badge.</LINE>
<LINE>Thrice-noble Titus, spare my first-born son!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Patient yourself, madam, and pardon me.</LINE>
<LINE>These are their brethren, whom your Goths beheld</LINE>
<LINE>Alive and dead, and for their brethren slain</LINE>
<LINE>Religiously they ask a sacrifice:</LINE>
<LINE>To this your son is mark&#8217;d, and die he must,</LINE>
<LINE>T&#8217; appease their groaning shadows that are gone.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Away with him, and make a fire straight,</LINE>
<LINE>And with our swords, upon a pile of wood,</LINE>
<LINE>Let&#8217;s hew his limbs till they be clean consum&#8217;d.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt Titus&#8217; sons with Alarbus.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O cruel, irreligious piety!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHI.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Was never Scythia half so barbarous.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DEM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Oppose not Scythia to ambitious Rome;</LINE>
<LINE>Alarbus goes to rest, and we survive</LINE>
<LINE>To tremble under Titus&#8217; threat&#8217;ning look.</LINE>
<LINE>Then, madam, stand resolv&#8217;d, but hope withal</LINE>
<LINE>The self-same gods that arm&#8217;d the Queen of Troy</LINE>
<LINE>With opportunity of sharp revenge</LINE>
<LINE>Upon the Thracian tyrant in his tent</LINE>
<LINE>May favor Tamora, the Queen of Goths</LINE>
<LINE>(When Goths were Goths and Tamora was queen),</LINE>
<LINE>To quit the bloody wrongs upon her foes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter the sons of Andronicus (Lucius, Quintus, Martius, and Mutius) again with their swords bloody.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>See, lord and father, how we have perform&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>Our Roman rites. Alarbus&#8217; limbs are lopp&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>And entrails feed the sacrificing fire,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose smoke like incense doth perfume the sky.</LINE>
<LINE>Remaineth nought but to inter our brethren,</LINE>
<LINE>And with loud &#8217;larums welcome them to Rome.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let it be so, and let Andronicus</LINE>
<LINE>Make this his latest farewell to their souls.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Sound trumpets, and lay the coffin in the tomb.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>In peace and honor rest you here, my sons,</LINE>
<LINE>Rome&#8217;s readiest champions, repose you here in rest,</LINE>
<LINE>Secure from worldly chances and mishaps!</LINE>
<LINE>Here lurks no treason, here no envy swells,</LINE>
<LINE>Here grow no damned drugs, here are no storms,</LINE>
<LINE>No noise, but silence and eternal sleep.</LINE>
<LINE>In peace and honor rest you here, my sons!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Lavinia.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In peace and honor live Lord Titus long!</LINE>
<LINE>My noble lord and father, live in fame!</LINE>
<LINE>Lo at this tomb my tributary tears</LINE>
<LINE>I render for my brethren&#8217;s obsequies;</LINE>
<LINE>And at thy feet I kneel, with tears of joy</LINE>
<LINE>Shed on this earth for thy return to Rome.</LINE>
<LINE>O, bless me here with thy victorious hand,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose fortunes Rome&#8217;s best citizens applaud!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Kind Rome, that hast thus lovingly reserv&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>The cordial of mine age to glad my heart!</LINE>

<LINE>You that survive, and you that sleep in fame!</LINE>
<LINE>Fair lords, your fortunes are alike in all,</LINE>
<LINE>That in your country&#8217;s service drew your swords,</LINE>
<LINE>But safer triumph is this funeral pomp,</LINE>
<LINE>That hath aspir&#8217;d to Solon&#8217;s happiness,</LINE>
<LINE>And triumphs over chance in honor&#8217;s bed.</LINE>
<LINE>Titus Andronicus, the people of Rome,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose friend in justice thou hast ever been,</LINE>
<LINE>Send thee by me, their tribune and their trust,</LINE>
<LINE>This palliament of white and spotless hue,</LINE>
<LINE>And name thee in election for the empire,</LINE>
<LINE>With these our late-deceased emperor&#8217;s sons.</LINE>
<LINE>Be candidatus then and put it on,</LINE>
<LINE>And help to set a head on headless Rome.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A better head her glorious body fits</LINE>
<LINE>Than his that shakes for age and feebleness.</LINE>
<LINE>What should I don this robe and trouble you?</LINE>
<LINE>Be chosen with proclamations today,</LINE>
<LINE>Tomorrow yield up rule, resign my life,</LINE>
<LINE>And set abroad new business for you all?</LINE>
<LINE>Rome, I have been thy soldier forty years,</LINE>
<LINE>And led my country&#8217;s strength successfully,</LINE>
<LINE>And buried one and twenty valiant sons,</LINE>
<LINE>Knighted in field, slain manfully in arms,</LINE>
<LINE>In right and service of their noble country.</LINE>
<LINE>Give me a staff of honor for mine age,</LINE>
<LINE>But not a sceptre to control the world.</LINE>
<LINE>Upright he held it, lords, that held it last.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE offset="6">Romans, do me right.</LINE>
<LINE>Patricians, draw your swords, and sheathe them not</LINE>
<LINE>Till Saturninus be Rome&#8217;s emperor.</LINE>
<LINE>Andronicus, would thou were shipp&#8217;d to hell,</LINE>
<LINE>Rather than rob me of the people&#8217;s hearts!</LINE>

<LINE>His noble nephew here in virtue&#8217;s nest,</LINE>

<LINE>The Greeks upon advice did bury Ajax</LINE>
<LINE>That slew himself; and wise Laertes&#8217; son</LINE>
<LINE>Did graciously plead for his funerals;</LINE>
<LINE>Let not young Mutius then, that was thy joy,</LINE>

<LINE>My lord, to step out of these dreary dumps,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know not, Marcus, but I know it is</LINE>

<LINE>Only thus much I give your Grace to know:</LINE>
<LINE>By all the duties that I owe to Rome,</LINE>
<LINE>This noble gentleman, Lord Titus here,</LINE>
<LINE>Is in opinion and in honor wrong&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>That in the rescue of Lavinia</LINE>
<LINE>With his own hand did slay his youngest son,</LINE>
<LINE>In zeal to you, and highly mov&#8217;d to wrath</LINE>
<LINE>To be controll&#8217;d in that he frankly gave.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My worthy lord, if ever Tamora</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not so, my lord, the gods of Rome forfend</LINE>
<LINE>I should be author to dishonor you!</LINE>
<LINE>But on mine honor dare I undertake</LINE>
<LINE>For good Lord Titus&#8217; innocence in all,</LINE>

<LINE>You are but newly planted in your throne;</LINE>
<LINE>Lest then the people, and patricians too,</LINE>
<LINE>Upon a just survey take Titus&#8217; part,</LINE>
<LINE>And so supplant you for ingratitude,</LINE>
<LINE>Which Rome reputes to be a heinous sin,</LINE>
<LINE>Yield at entreats; and then let me alone,</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll find a day to massacre them all,</LINE>
<LINE>And rase their faction and their family,</LINE>
<LINE>The cruel father and his traitorous sons,</LINE>
<LINE>To whom I sued for my dear son&#8217;s life;</LINE>
<LINE>And make them know what &#8217;tis to let a queen</LINE>
<LINE>Kneel in the streets and beg for grace in vain.&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Come, come, sweet emperor&#8212;come, Andronicus&#8212;</LINE>

<LINE>It is to jet upon a prince&#8217;s right?</LINE>
<LINE>What, is Lavinia then become so loose,</LINE>
<LINE>Or Bassianus so degenerate,</LINE>
<LINE>That for her love such quarrels may be broach&#8217;d,</LINE>

<LINE>That you affect, and so must you resolve,</LINE>
<LINE>That what you cannot as you would achieve,</LINE>
<LINE>You must perforce accomplish as you may.</LINE>
<LINE>Take this of me: Lucrece was not more chaste</LINE>
<LINE>Than this Lavinia, Bassianus&#8217; love.</LINE>
<LINE>A speedier course than ling&#8217;ring languishment</LINE>
<LINE>Must we pursue, and I have found the path:</LINE>
<LINE>My lords, a solemn hunting is in hand,</LINE>
<LINE>There will the lovely Roman ladies troop;</LINE>
<LINE>The forest walks are wide and spacious,</LINE>
<LINE>And many unfrequented plots there are,</LINE>
<LINE>Fitted by kind for rape and villainy.</LINE>
<LINE>Single you thither then this dainty doe,</LINE>
<LINE>And strike her home by force, if not by words;</LINE>
<LINE>This way, or not at all, stand you in hope.</LINE>
<LINE>Come, come, our empress, with her sacred wit</LINE>
<LINE>To villainy and vengeance consecrate,</LINE>
<LINE>Will we acquaint withal what we intend,</LINE>
<LINE>And she shall file our engines with advice,</LINE>
<LINE>That will not suffer you to square yourselves,</LINE>
<LINE>But to your wishes&#8217; height advance you both.</LINE>
<LINE>The Emperor&#8217;s court is like the house of Fame,</LINE>
<LINE>The palace full of tongues, of eyes, and ears;</LINE>
<LINE>The woods are ruthless, dreadful, deaf, and dull.</LINE>
<LINE>There speak, and strike, brave boys, and take your turns,</LINE>
<LINE>There serve your lust, shadowed from heaven&#8217;s eye,</LINE>
<LINE>And revel in Lavinia&#8217;s treasury.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>The hunt is up, the morn is bright and grey,</LINE>
<LINE>The fields are fragrant and the woods are green.</LINE>
<LINE>Uncouple here and let us make a bay,</LINE>
<LINE>And wake the Emperor and his lovely bride,</LINE>

<LINE>That all the court may echo with the noise.</LINE>
<LINE>Sons, let it be your charge, as it is ours,</LINE>
<LINE>To attend the Emperor&#8217;s person carefully.</LINE>
<LINE>I have been troubled in my sleep this night,</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Aaron alone with a bag of gold.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He that had wit would think that I had none,</LINE>
<LINE>To bury so much gold under a tree,</LINE>
<LINE>And never after to inherit it.</LINE>
<LINE>Let him that thinks of me so abjectly</LINE>
<LINE>Know that this gold must coin a stratagem,</LINE>
<LINE>Which cunningly effected will beget</LINE>
<LINE>A very excellent piece of villainy.</LINE>
<LINE>And so repose, sweet gold, for their unrest,</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Hides the gold.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>That have their alms out of the Empress&#8217; chest.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Tamora alone to the Moor.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lovely Aaron, wherefore look&#8217;st thou sad,</LINE>
<LINE>When every thing doth make a gleeful boast?</LINE>
<LINE>The birds chaunt melody on every bush,</LINE>
<LINE>The snake lies rolled in the cheerful sun,</LINE>
<LINE>The green leaves quiver with the cooling wind</LINE>
<LINE>And make a checker&#8217;d shadow on the ground.</LINE>
<LINE>Under their sweet shade, Aaron, let us sit,</LINE>
<LINE>And whilst the babbling echo mocks the hounds,</LINE>
<LINE>Replying shrilly to the well-tun&#8217;d horns,</LINE>
<LINE>As if a double hunt were heard at once,</LINE>
<LINE>Let us sit down and mark their yellowing noise;</LINE>
<LINE>And after conflict such as was suppos&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>The wand&#8217;ring prince and Dido once enjoyed,</LINE>
<LINE>When with a happy storm they were surpris&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>And curtain&#8217;d with a counsel-keeping cave,</LINE>
<LINE>We may, each wreathed in the other&#8217;s arms</LINE>
<LINE>(Our pastimes done), possess a golden slumber,</LINE>
<LINE>Whiles hounds and horns and sweet melodious birds</LINE>
<LINE>Be unto us as is a nurse&#8217;s song</LINE>
<LINE>Of lullaby to bring her babe asleep.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Madam, though Venus govern your desires,</LINE>
<LINE>Saturn is dominator over mine:</LINE>
<LINE>What signifies my deadly-standing eye,</LINE>
<LINE>My silence, an&#8217; my cloudy melancholy,</LINE>
<LINE>My fleece of woolly hair that now uncurls,</LINE>
<LINE>Even as an adder when she doth unroll</LINE>
<LINE>To do some fatal execution?</LINE>
<LINE>No, madam, these are no venereal signs.</LINE>
<LINE>Vengeance is in my heart, death in my hand,</LINE>
<LINE>Blood and revenge are hammering in my head.</LINE>
<LINE>Hark, Tamora, the empress of my soul,</LINE>
<LINE>Which never hopes more heaven than rests in thee,</LINE>
<LINE>This is the day of doom for Bassianus:</LINE>
<LINE>His Philomel must lose her tongue today,</LINE>
<LINE>Thy sons make pillage of her chastity,</LINE>
<LINE>And wash their hands in Bassianus&#8217; blood.</LINE>
<LINE>Seest thou this letter? Take it up, I pray thee,</LINE>
<LINE>And give the King this fatal-plotted scroll.</LINE>
<LINE>Now question me no more, we are espied.</LINE>
<LINE>Here comes a parcel of our hopeful booty,</LINE>
<LINE>Which dreads not yet their lives&#8217; destruction.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Bassianus and Lavinia.</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>No more, great Empress, Bassianus comes.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>BAS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who have we here? Rome&#8217;s royal Emperess,</LINE>
<LINE>Unfurnish&#8217;d of her well-beseeming troop?</LINE>
<LINE>Or is it Dian habited like her,</LINE>
<LINE>Who hath abandoned her holy groves</LINE>
<LINE>To see the general hunting in this forest?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Saucy controller of my private steps!</LINE>
<LINE>Had I the pow&#8217;r that some say Dian had,</LINE>
<LINE>Thy temples should be planted presently</LINE>
<LINE>With horns, as was Actaeon&#8217;s, and the hounds</LINE>
<LINE>Should drive upon thy new-transformed limbs,</LINE>
<LINE>Unmannerly intruder as thou art!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Under your patience, gentle Emperess,</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis thought you have a goodly gift in horning,</LINE>
<LINE>And to be doubted that your Moor and you</LINE>
<LINE>Are singled forth to try thy experiments.</LINE>
<LINE>Jove shield your husband from his hounds today!</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis pity they should take him for a stag.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Believe me, Queen, your swart Cimmerian</LINE>
<LINE>Doth make your honor of his body&#8217;s hue,</LINE>
<LINE>Spotted, detested, and abominable.</LINE>
<LINE>Why are you sequest&#8217;red from all your train,</LINE>
<LINE>Dismounted from your snow-white goodly steed,</LINE>
<LINE>And wand&#8217;red hither to an obscure plot,</LINE>
<LINE>Accompanied but with a barbarous Moor,</LINE>
<LINE>If foul desire had not conducted you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And, being intercepted in your sport,</LINE>
<LINE>Great reason that my noble lord be rated</LINE>
<LINE>For sauciness. I pray you let us hence,</LINE>
<LINE>And let her joy her raven-colored love;</LINE>
<LINE>This valley fits the purpose passing well.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The King my brother shall have notice of this.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, for these slips have made him noted long,</LINE>
<LINE>Good king, to be so mightily abused.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, I have patience to endure all this.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Chiron and Demetrius.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DEM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How now, dear sovereign and our gracious mother?</LINE>
<LINE>Why doth your Highness look so pale and wan?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Have I not reason, think you, to look pale?</LINE>
<LINE>These two have &#8217;ticed me hither to this place:</LINE>
<LINE>A barren detested vale you see it is;</LINE>
<LINE>The trees, though summer, yet forlorn and lean,</LINE>
<LINE>Overcome with moss and baleful mistletoe;</LINE>
<LINE>Here never shines the sun, here nothing breeds,</LINE>
<LINE>Unless the nightly owl or fatal raven;</LINE>
<LINE>And when they show&#8217;d me this abhorred pit,</LINE>
<LINE>They told me, here, at dead time of the night,</LINE>
<LINE>A thousand fiends, a thousand hissing snakes,</LINE>
<LINE>Ten thousand swelling toads, as many urchins,</LINE>
<LINE>Would make such fearful and confused cries,</LINE>
<LINE>As any mortal body hearing it</LINE>
<LINE>Should straight fall mad, or else die suddenly.</LINE>
<LINE>No sooner had they told this hellish tale,</LINE>
<LINE>But straight they told me they would bind me here</LINE>
<LINE>Unto the body of a dismal yew,</LINE>
<LINE>And leave me to this miserable death.</LINE>
<LINE>And then they call&#8217;d me foul adulteress,</LINE>
<LINE>Lascivious Goth, and all the bitterest terms</LINE>
<LINE>That ever ear did hear to such effect;</LINE>
<LINE>And had you not by wondrous fortune come,</LINE>
<LINE>This vengeance on me had they executed:</LINE>
<LINE>Revenge it, as you love your mother&#8217;s life,</LINE>
<LINE>Or be ye not henceforth call&#8217;d my children.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Ay, come, Semiramis, nay, barbarous Tamora,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Give me the poniard; you shall know, my boys,</LINE>
<LINE>Your mother&#8217;s hand shall right your mother&#8217;s wrong.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DEM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Stay, madam, here is more belongs to her:</LINE>
<LINE>First thrash the corn, then after burn the straw.</LINE>
<LINE>This minion stood upon her chastity,</LINE>
<LINE>Upon her nuptial vow, her loyalty,</LINE>
<LINE>And with that painted hope braves your mightiness;</LINE>
<LINE>And shall she carry this unto her grave?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHI.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And if she do, I would I were an eunuch.</LINE>
<LINE>Drag hence her husband to some secret hole,</LINE>
<LINE>And make his dead trunk pillow to our lust.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But when ye have the honey we desire,</LINE>
<LINE>Let not this wasp outlive, us both to sting.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHI.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I warrant you, madam, we will make that sure.</LINE>
<LINE>Come, mistress, now perforce we will enjoy</LINE>

<LINE>O Tamora, thou bearest a woman&#8217;s face&#8212;</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sweet lords, entreat her hear me but a word.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DEM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Listen, fair madam, let it be your glory</LINE>
<LINE>To see her tears, but be your heart to them</LINE>
<LINE>As unrelenting flint to drops of rain.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>When did the tiger&#8217;s young ones teach the dam?</LINE>
<LINE>O, do not learn her wrath&#8212;she taught it thee;</LINE>
<LINE>The milk thou suck&#8217;st from her did turn to marble,</LINE>
<LINE>Even at thy teat thou hadst thy tyranny;</LINE>
<LINE>Yet every mother breeds not sons alike&#8212;</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>To Chiron.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Do thou entreat her show a woman&#8217;s pity.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHI.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, wouldst thou have me prove myself a bastard?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis true, the raven doth not hatch a lark,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet have I heard&#8212;O, could I find it now!&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>The lion, mov&#8217;d with pity, did endure</LINE>
<LINE>To have his princely paws par&#8217;d all away.</LINE>
<LINE>Some say that ravens foster forlorn children</LINE>
<LINE>The whilst their own birds famish in their nests;</LINE>
<LINE>O, be to me, though thy hard heart say no,</LINE>
<LINE>Nothing so kind, but something pitiful!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know not what it means, away with her!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, let me teach thee! For my father&#8217;s sake,</LINE>
<LINE>That gave thee life when well he might have slain thee,</LINE>
<LINE>Be not obdurate, open thy deaf years.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hadst thou in person ne&#8217;er offended me,</LINE>
<LINE>Even for his sake am I pitiless.</LINE>
<LINE>Remember, boys, I pour&#8217;d forth tears in vain</LINE>
<LINE>To save your brother from the sacrifice,</LINE>
<LINE>But fierce Andronicus would not relent.</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore away with her, and use her as you will;</LINE>
<LINE>The worse to her, the better lov&#8217;d of me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O Tamora, be call&#8217;d a gentle queen,</LINE>
<LINE>And with thine own hands kill me in this place!</LINE>
<LINE>For &#8217;tis not life that I have begg&#8217;d so long,</LINE>
<LINE>Poor I was slain when Bassianus died.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What beg&#8217;st thou then? Fond woman, let me go.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis present death I beg, and one thing more</LINE>
<LINE>That womanhood denies my tongue to tell.</LINE>
<LINE>O, keep me from their worse than killing lust,</LINE>
<LINE>And tumble me into some loathsome pit,</LINE>
<LINE>Where never man&#8217;s eye may behold my body:</LINE>
<LINE>Do this, and be a charitable murderer.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So should I rob my sweet sons of their fee.</LINE>
<LINE>No, let them satisfice their lust on thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DEM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Away, for thou hast stay&#8217;d us here too long.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No grace? No womanhood? Ah, beastly creature,</LINE>
<LINE>The blot and enemy to our general name!</LINE>
<LINE>Confusion fall&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHI.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay then I&#8217;ll stop your mouth. Bring thou her husband;</LINE>
<LINE>This is the hole where Aaron bid us hide him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Demetrius throws the body of Bassianus into the pit; then exeunt Demetrius and Chiron dragging off Lavinia.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Farewell, my sons, see that you make her sure.</LINE>
<LINE>Ne&#8217;er let my heart know merry cheer indeed</LINE>
<LINE>Till all the Andronici be made away.</LINE>
<LINE>Now will I hence to seek my lovely Moor,</LINE>

<LINE>Come on, my lords, the better foot before.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Falls into the pit.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUIN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, art thou fallen? What subtile hole is this,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose mouth is covered with rude-growing briers,</LINE>
<LINE>Upon whose leaves are drops of new-shed blood</LINE>
<LINE>As fresh as morning dew distill&#8217;d on flowers?</LINE>
<LINE>A very fatal place it seems to me.</LINE>
<LINE>Speak, brother, hast thou hurt thee with the fall?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>O brother, with the dismall&#8217;st object hurt</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUIN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am surprised with an uncouth fear,</LINE>
<LINE>A chilling sweat o&#8217;erruns my trembling joints,</LINE>
<LINE>My heart suspects more than mine eye can see.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MART.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To prove thou hast a true-divining heart,</LINE>

<SPEAKER>QUIN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Aaron is gone, and my compassionate heart</LINE>

<LINE>The thing whereat it trembles by surmise.</LINE>
<LINE>O, tell me who it is, for ne&#8217;er till now</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MART.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Lord Bassianus lies beray&#8217;d in blood,</LINE>

<LINE>If it be dark, how dost thou know &#8217;tis he?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MART.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Upon his bloody finger he doth wear</LINE>
<LINE>A precious ring that lightens all this hole,</LINE>
<LINE>Which, like a taper in some monument,</LINE>
<LINE>Doth shine upon the dead man&#8217;s earthy cheeks,</LINE>
<LINE>And shows the ragged entrails of this pit:</LINE>
<LINE>So pale did shine the moon on Pyramus</LINE>
<LINE>When he by night lay bath&#8217;d in maiden blood.</LINE>
<LINE>O brother, help me with thy fainting hand&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>If fear hath made thee faint, as me it hath&#8212;</LINE>

<LINE>High Emperor, upon my feeble knee</LINE>
<LINE>I beg this boon, with tears not lightly shed,</LINE>
<LINE>That this fell fault of my accursed sons&#8212;</LINE>

<LINE>Andronicus himself did take it up.</LINE>

<LINE>I did, my lord, yet let me be their bail,</LINE>

<LINE>Thou shalt not bail them, see thou follow me.</LINE>

<LINE>Who is this? My niece, that flies away so fast?</LINE>
<LINE>Cousin, a word; where is your husband?</LINE>
<LINE>If I do dream, would all my wealth would wake me!</LINE>
<LINE>If I do wake, some planet strike me down,</LINE>
<LINE>That I may slumber an eternal sleep!</LINE>
<LINE>Speak, gentle niece: what stern ungentle hands</LINE>
<LINE>Hath lopp&#8217;d and hew&#8217;d, and made thy body bare</LINE>
<LINE>Of her two branches, those sweet ornaments</LINE>
<LINE>Whose circling shadows kings have sought to sleep in,</LINE>
<LINE>And might not gain so great a happiness</LINE>
<LINE>As half thy love? Why dost not speak to me?</LINE>
<LINE>Alas, a crimson river of warm blood,</LINE>
<LINE>Like to a bubbling fountain stirr&#8217;d with wind,</LINE>
<LINE>Doth rise and fall between thy rosed lips,</LINE>
<LINE>Coming and going with thy honey breath.</LINE>
<LINE>But sure some Tereus hath deflow&#8217;red thee,</LINE>
<LINE>And lest thou shouldst detect him, cut thy tongue.</LINE>
<LINE>Ah, now thou turn&#8217;st away thy face for shame!</LINE>
<LINE>And notwithstanding all this loss of blood,</LINE>
<LINE>As from a conduit with three issuing spouts,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet do thy cheeks look red as Titan&#8217;s face</LINE>
<LINE>Blushing to be encount&#8217;red with a cloud.</LINE>
<LINE>Shall I speak for thee? Shall I say &#8217;tis so?</LINE>
<LINE>O that I knew thy heart, and knew the beast,</LINE>
<LINE>That I might rail at him to ease my mind!</LINE>
<LINE>Sorrow concealed, like an oven stopp&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Doth burn the heart to cinders where it is.</LINE>
<LINE>Fair Philomela, why, she but lost her tongue,</LINE>
<LINE>And in a tedious sampler sew&#8217;d her mind;</LINE>
<LINE>But, lovely niece, that mean is cut from thee.</LINE>
<LINE>A craftier Tereus, cousin, hast thou met,</LINE>
<LINE>And he hath cut those pretty fingers off</LINE>
<LINE>That could have better sew&#8217;d than Philomel.</LINE>
<LINE>O, had the monster seen those lily hands</LINE>
<LINE>Tremble like aspen leaves upon a lute,</LINE>
<LINE>And make the silken strings delight to kiss them,</LINE>
<LINE>He would not then have touch&#8217;d them for his life!</LINE>

<SCENELOCATION>Rome. A street.</SCENELOCATION>
<SCENEPERSONAE>(Judges, Senators, Tribunes, Martius, Quintus, Titus, Lucius, Marcus, Lavinia, Aaron the Moor, Messenger)</SCENEPERSONAE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter the Judges and Senators and Tribunes, with Titus&#8217; two sons Martius and Quintus bound, passing on the stage to the place of execution, and Titus going before, pleading.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hear me, grave fathers! Noble tribunes, stay!</LINE>
<LINE>For pity of mine age, whose youth was spent</LINE>
<LINE>In dangerous wars whilst you securely slept;</LINE>
<LINE>For all my blood in Rome&#8217;s great quarrel shed,</LINE>
<LINE>For all the frosty nights that I have watch&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>And for these bitter tears which now you see</LINE>
<LINE>Filling the aged wrinkles in my cheeks,</LINE>
<LINE>Be pitiful to my condemned sons,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose souls is not corrupted as &#8217;tis thought.</LINE>
<LINE>For two and twenty sons I never wept,</LINE>
<LINE>Because they died in honor&#8217;s lofty bed.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Andronicus lieth down, and the Judges etc. pass by him and exeunt with the prisoners.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>For these, tribunes, in the dust I write</LINE>
<LINE>My heart&#8217;s deep languor, and my soul&#8217;s sad tears:</LINE>
<LINE>Let my tears staunch the earth&#8217;s dry appetite,</LINE>
<LINE>My sons&#8217; sweet blood will make it shame and blush.</LINE>
<LINE>O earth, I will befriend thee more with rain,</LINE>
<LINE>That shall distill from these two ancient urns,</LINE>
<LINE>Than youthful April shall with all his show&#8217;rs.</LINE>
<LINE>In summer&#8217;s drought I&#8217;ll drop upon thee still,</LINE>
<LINE>In winter with warm tears I&#8217;ll melt the snow,</LINE>
<LINE>And keep eternal spring-time on thy face,</LINE>
<LINE>So thou refuse to drink my dear sons&#8217; blood.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Lucius with his weapon drawn.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>O reverent tribunes! O gentle, aged men!</LINE>
<LINE>Unbind my sons, reverse the doom of death,</LINE>
<LINE>And let me say (that never wept before)</LINE>
<LINE>My tears are now prevailing orators.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O noble father, you lament in vain:</LINE>
<LINE>The tribunes hear you not, no man is by,</LINE>
<LINE>And you recount your sorrows to a stone.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ah, Lucius, for thy brothers let me plead.</LINE>
<LINE>Grave tribunes, once more I entreat of you&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My gracious lord, no tribune hears you speak.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, &#8217;tis no matter, man: if they did hear,</LINE>
<LINE>They would not mark me; if they did mark,</LINE>
<LINE>They would not pity me; yet plead I must,</LINE>
<LINE>And bootless unto them.</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore I tell my sorrows to the stones,</LINE>
<LINE>Who, though they cannot answer my distress,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet in some sort they are better than the tribunes,</LINE>
<LINE>For that they will not intercept my tale.</LINE>
<LINE>When I do weep, they humbly at my feet</LINE>
<LINE>Receive my tears, and seem to weep with me,</LINE>
<LINE>And were they but attired in grave weeds,</LINE>
<LINE>Rome could afford no tribunes like to these.</LINE>
<LINE>A stone is soft as wax, tribunes more hard than stones;</LINE>
<LINE>A stone is silent, and offendeth not,</LINE>
<LINE>And tribunes with their tongues doom men to death.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Rises.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>But wherefore stand&#8217;st thou with thy weapon drawn?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To rescue my two brothers from their death,</LINE>
<LINE>For which attempt the judges have pronounc&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>My everlasting doom of banishment.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O happy man, they have befriended thee!</LINE>
<LINE>Why, foolish Lucius, dost thou not perceive</LINE>
<LINE>That Rome is but a wilderness of tigers?</LINE>
<LINE>Tigers must prey, and Rome affords no prey</LINE>
<LINE>But me and mine. How happy art thou then,</LINE>
<LINE>From these devourers to be banished!</LINE>
<LINE>But who comes with our brother Marcus here?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Marcus with Lavinia.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Titus, prepare thy aged eyes to weep,</LINE>
<LINE>Or if not so, thy noble heart to break:</LINE>
<LINE>I bring consuming sorrow to thine age.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Will it consume me? Let me see it then.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This was thy daughter.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Why, Marcus, so she is.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay me, this object kills me!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Faint-hearted boy, arise and look upon her.</LINE>
<LINE>Speak, Lavinia, what accursed hand</LINE>
<LINE>Hath made thee handless in thy father&#8217;s sight?</LINE>
<LINE>What fool hath added water to the sea?</LINE>
<LINE>Or brought a faggot to bright-burning Troy?</LINE>
<LINE>My grief was at the height before thou cam&#8217;st,</LINE>
<LINE>And now like Nilus it disdaineth bounds.</LINE>
<LINE>Give me a sword, I&#8217;ll chop off my hands too,</LINE>
<LINE>For they have fought for Rome, and all in vain;</LINE>
<LINE>And they have nurs&#8217;d this woe, in feeding life;</LINE>
<LINE>In bootless prayer have they been held up,</LINE>
<LINE>And they have serv&#8217;d me to effectless use.</LINE>
<LINE>Now all the service I require of them</LINE>
<LINE>Is that the one will help to cut the other.</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis well, Lavinia, that thou hast no hands,</LINE>
<LINE>For hands to do Rome service is but vain.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Speak, gentle sister, who hath mart&#8217;red thee?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, that delightful engine of her thoughts,</LINE>
<LINE>That blabb&#8217;d them with such pleasing eloquence,</LINE>
<LINE>Is torn from forth that pretty hollow cage,</LINE>
<LINE>Where like a sweet melodious bird it sung</LINE>
<LINE>Sweet varied notes, enchanting every ear!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, say thou for her, who hath done this deed?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, thus I found her straying in the park,</LINE>
<LINE>Seeking to hide herself, as doth the deer</LINE>
<LINE>That hath receiv&#8217;d some unrecuring wound.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It was my dear, and he that wounded her</LINE>
<LINE>Hath hurt me more than had he kill&#8217;d me dead:</LINE>
<LINE>For now I stand as one upon a rock,</LINE>
<LINE>Environ&#8217;d with a wilderness of sea,</LINE>
<LINE>Who marks the waxing tide grow wave by wave,</LINE>
<LINE>Expecting ever when some envious surge</LINE>
<LINE>Will in his brinish bowels swallow him.</LINE>
<LINE>This way to death my wretched sons are gone,</LINE>
<LINE>Here stands my other son, a banish&#8217;d man,</LINE>
<LINE>And here my brother, weeping at my woes;</LINE>
<LINE>But that which gives my soul the greatest spurn</LINE>
<LINE>Is dear Lavinia, dearer than my soul.</LINE>
<LINE>Had I but seen thy picture in this plight,</LINE>
<LINE>It would have madded me; what shall I do</LINE>
<LINE>Now I behold thy lively body so?</LINE>
<LINE>Thou hast no hands to wipe away thy tears,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor tongue to tell me who hath mart&#8217;red thee.</LINE>
<LINE>Thy husband he is dead, and for his death</LINE>
<LINE>Thy brothers are condemn&#8217;d, and dead by this.</LINE>
<LINE>Look, Marcus! Ah, son Lucius, look on her!</LINE>
<LINE>When I did name her brothers, then fresh tears</LINE>
<LINE>Stood on her cheeks, as doth the honey-dew</LINE>
<LINE>Upon a gath&#8217;red lily almost withered.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Perchance she weeps because they kill&#8217;d her husband,</LINE>
<LINE>Perchance because she knows them innocent.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If they did kill thy husband, then be joyful,</LINE>
<LINE>Because the law hath ta&#8217;en revenge on them.</LINE>
<LINE>No, no, they would not do so foul a deed;</LINE>
<LINE>Witness the sorrow that their sister makes.</LINE>
<LINE>Gentle Lavinia, let me kiss thy lips,</LINE>
<LINE>Or make some sign how I may do thee ease.</LINE>
<LINE>Shall thy good uncle, and thy brother Lucius,</LINE>
<LINE>And thou, and I, sit round about some fountain,</LINE>
<LINE>Looking all downwards to behold our cheeks,</LINE>
<LINE>How they are stain&#8217;d like meadows yet not dry,</LINE>
<LINE>With miry slime left on them by a flood?</LINE>
<LINE>And in the fountain shall we gaze so long</LINE>
<LINE>Till the fresh taste be taken from that clearness,</LINE>
<LINE>And made a brine-pit with our bitter tears?</LINE>
<LINE>Or shall we cut away our hands like thine?</LINE>
<LINE>Or shall we bite our tongues, and in dumb shows</LINE>
<LINE>Pass the remainder of our hateful days?</LINE>
<LINE>What shall we do? Let us that have our tongues</LINE>
<LINE>Plot some device of further misery,</LINE>
<LINE>To make us wonder&#8217;d at in time to come.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sweet father, cease your tears, for at your grief</LINE>
<LINE>See how my wretched sister sobs and weeps.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Patience, dear niece. Good Titus, dry thine eyes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ah, Marcus, Marcus! Brother, well I wot,</LINE>
<LINE>Thy napkin cannot drink a tear of mine,</LINE>
<LINE>For thou, poor man, hast drown&#8217;d it with thine own.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ah, my Lavinia, I will wipe thy cheeks.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Mark, Marcus, mark! I understand her signs.</LINE>
<LINE>Had she a tongue to speak, now would she say</LINE>
<LINE>That to her brother which I said to thee:</LINE>
<LINE>His napkin, with his true tears all bewet,</LINE>
<LINE>Can do no service on her sorrowful cheeks.</LINE>
<LINE>O, what a sympathy of woe is this,</LINE>
<LINE>As far from help as limbo is from bliss!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Aaron the Moor alone.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Titus Andronicus, my lord the Emperor</LINE>
<LINE>Sends thee this word&#8212;that, if thou love thy sons,</LINE>
<LINE>Let Marcus, Lucius, or thyself, old Titus,</LINE>
<LINE>Or any one of you, chop off your hand</LINE>
<LINE>And send it to the King; he for the same</LINE>
<LINE>Will send thee hither both thy sons alive,</LINE>
<LINE>And that shall be the ransom for their fault.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O gracious Emperor! O gentle Aaron!</LINE>
<LINE>Did ever raven sing so like a lark</LINE>
<LINE>That gives sweet tidings of the sun&#8217;s uprise?</LINE>
<LINE>With all my heart I&#8217;ll send the Emperor my hand.</LINE>
<LINE>Good Aaron, wilt thou help to chop it off?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Stay, father, for that noble hand of thine,</LINE>
<LINE>That hath thrown down so many enemies,</LINE>
<LINE>Shall not be sent. My hand will serve the turn.</LINE>
<LINE>My youth can better spare my blood than you,</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore mine shall save my brothers&#8217; lives.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Which of your hands hath not defended Rome,</LINE>
<LINE>And rear&#8217;d aloft the bloody battle-axe,</LINE>
<LINE>Writing destruction on the enemy&#8217;s castle?</LINE>
<LINE>O, none of both but are of high desert.</LINE>
<LINE>My hand hath been but idle, let it serve</LINE>
<LINE>To ransom my two nephews from their death;</LINE>
<LINE>Then have I kept it to a worthy end.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, come, agree whose hand shall go along,</LINE>
<LINE>For fear they die before their pardon come.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>My hand shall go.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>TIT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sirs, strive no more: such with&#8217;red herbs as these</LINE>
<LINE>Are meet for plucking up, and therefore mine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sweet rather, if I shall be thought thy son,</LINE>
<LINE>Let me redeem my brothers both from death.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And for our father&#8217;s sake, and mother&#8217;s care,</LINE>
<LINE>Now let me show a brother&#8217;s love to thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Agree between you, I will spare my hand.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then I&#8217;ll go fetch an axe.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Come hither, Aaron. I&#8217;ll deceive them both;</LINE>
<LINE>Lend me thy hand, and I will give thee mine.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AAR.</SPEAKER>
<STAGEDIR>Aside.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>If that be call&#8217;d deceit, I will be honest,</LINE>
<LINE>And never whilst I live deceive men so;</LINE>
<LINE>But I&#8217;ll deceive you in another sort,</LINE>
<LINE>And that You&#8217;ll say ere half an hour pass.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>TIT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now stay your strife, what shall be is dispatch&#8217;d.</LINE>
<LINE>Good Aaron, give his Majesty my hand.</LINE>
<LINE>Tell him it was a hand that warded him</LINE>
<LINE>From thousand dangers, bid him bury it:</LINE>
<LINE>More hath it merited, that let it have.</LINE>
<LINE>As for my sons, say I account of them</LINE>
<LINE>As jewels purchas&#8217;d at an easy price,</LINE>
<LINE>And yet dear too, because I bought mine own.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I go, Andronicus, and for thy hand</LINE>
<LINE>Look by and by to have thy sons with thee.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Aside.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Their heads, I mean. O how this villainy</LINE>
<LINE>Doth fat me with the very thoughts of it!</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>To Lavinia.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE offset="3">What, wouldst thou kneel with me?</LINE>
<LINE>Do then, dear heart, for heaven shall hear our prayers,</LINE>

<LINE>If there were reason for these miseries,</LINE>
<LINE>Then into limits could I bind my woes:</LINE>
<LINE>When heaven doth weep, doth not the earth o&#8217;erflow?</LINE>
<LINE>If the winds rage, doth not the sea wax mad,</LINE>
<LINE>Threat&#8217;ning the welkin with his big-swoll&#8217;n face?</LINE>
<LINE>And wilt thou have a reason for this coil?</LINE>
<LINE>I am the sea; hark how her sighs doth blow!</LINE>
<LINE>She is the weeping welkin, I the earth:</LINE>
<LINE>Then must my sea be moved with her sighs;</LINE>
<LINE>Then must my earth with her continual tears</LINE>
<LINE>Become a deluge, overflow&#8217;d and drown&#8217;d:</LINE>
<LINE>For why my bowels cannot hide her woes,</LINE>
<LINE>But like a drunkard must I vomit them.</LINE>
<LINE>Then give me leave, for losers will have leave</LINE>
<LINE>To ease their stomachs with their bitter tongues.</LINE>

<LINE>Worthy Andronicus, ill art thou repaid</LINE>

<LINE>Here are the heads of thy two noble sons,</LINE>
<LINE>And here&#8217;s thy hand, in scorn to thee sent back&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Thy grief their sports! Thy resolution mock&#8217;d!</LINE>
<LINE>That woe is me to think upon thy woes,</LINE>

<LINE>Now let hot Aetna cool in Sicily,</LINE>

<LINE>These miseries are more than may be borne.</LINE>

<LINE>Ah, that this sight should make so deep a wound,</LINE>

<LINE>Now farewell, flatt&#8217;ry; die, Andronicus.</LINE>
<LINE>Thou dost not slumber; see thy two sons&#8217; heads,</LINE>
<LINE>Thy warlike hand, thy mangled daughter here,</LINE>
<LINE>Thy other banish&#8217;d son with this dear sight</LINE>
<LINE>Struck pale and bloodless, and thy brother, I,</LINE>
<LINE>Even like a stony image, cold and numb.</LINE>
<LINE>Ah, now no more will I control thy griefs.</LINE>
<LINE>Rent off thy silver hair, thy other hand</LINE>
<LINE>Gnawing with thy teeth, and be this dismal sight</LINE>
<LINE>The closing up of our most wretched eyes.</LINE>

<LINE>Why, I have not another tear to shed.</LINE>
<LINE>Besides, this sorrow is an enemy,</LINE>
<LINE>And would usurp upon my wat&#8217;ry eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>And make them blind with tributary tears;</LINE>
<LINE>Then which way shall I find Revenge&#8217;s cave?</LINE>
<LINE>For these two heads do seem to speak to me,</LINE>
<LINE>And threat me I shall never come to bliss</LINE>
<LINE>Till all these mischiefs be return&#8217;d again,</LINE>
<LINE>Even in their throats that hath committed them.</LINE>
<LINE>Come let me see what task I have to do.</LINE>
<LINE>You heavy people, circle me about,</LINE>
<LINE>That I may turn me to each one of you,</LINE>
<LINE>And swear unto my soul to right your wrongs.</LINE>
<LINE>The vow is made. Come, brother, take a head,</LINE>
<LINE>And in this hand the other will I bear;</LINE>
<LINE>And, Lavinia, thou shalt be employ&#8217;d;</LINE>
<LINE>Bear thou my hand, sweet wench, between thy teeth.</LINE>
<LINE>As for thee, boy, go get thee from my sight;</LINE>
<LINE>Thou art an exile, and thou must not stay.</LINE>

<LINE>So, so, now sit, and look you eat no more</LINE>

<LINE>As will revenge these bitter woes of ours.</LINE>
<LINE>Marcus, unknit that sorrow-wreathen knot;</LINE>
<LINE>Thy niece and I, poor creatures, want our hands</LINE>
<LINE>And cannot passionate our tenfold grief</LINE>
<LINE>With folded arms. This poor right hand of mine</LINE>
<LINE>Is left to tyrannize upon my breast,</LINE>
<LINE>Who, when my heart, all mad with misery,</LINE>
<LINE>Beats in this hollow prison of my flesh,</LINE>
<LINE>Then thus I thump it down.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>To Lavinia.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Thou map of woe, that thus dost talk in signs!</LINE>
<LINE>When thy poor heart beats with outrageous beating,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou canst not strike it thus to make it still.</LINE>
<LINE>Wound it with sighing, girl, kill it with groans;</LINE>
<LINE>Or get some little knife between thy teeth,</LINE>
<LINE>And just against thy heart make thou a hole,</LINE>
<LINE>That all the tears that thy poor eyes let fall</LINE>
<LINE>May run into that sink, and soaking in,</LINE>
<LINE>Drown the lamenting fool in sea-salt tears.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>MARC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fie, brother, fie, teach her not thus to lay</LINE>
<LINE>Such violent hands upon her tender life.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How now! Has sorrow made thee dote already?</LINE>
<LINE>Why, Marcus, no man should be mad but I.</LINE>
<LINE>What violent hands can she lay on her life?</LINE>
<LINE>Ah, wherefore dost thou urge the name of hands,</LINE>
<LINE>To bid Aeneas tell the tale twice o&#8217;er</LINE>
<LINE>How Troy was burnt and he made miserable?</LINE>
<LINE>O, handle not the theme, to talk of hands,</LINE>
<LINE>Lest we remember still that we have none.</LINE>
<LINE>Fie, fie, how franticly I square my talk,</LINE>
<LINE>As if we should forget we had no hands,</LINE>
<LINE>If Marcus did not name the word of hands!</LINE>
<LINE>Come, let&#8217;s fall to, and, gentle girl, eat this.</LINE>
<LINE>Here is no drink! Hark, Marcus, what she says;</LINE>
<LINE>I can interpret all her martyr&#8217;d signs:</LINE>
<LINE>She says, she drinks no other drink but tears,</LINE>
<LINE>Brew&#8217;d with her sorrow, mesh&#8217;d upon her cheeks.</LINE>
<LINE>Speechless complainant, I will learn thy thought;</LINE>
<LINE>In thy dumb action will I be as perfect</LINE>
<LINE>As begging hermits in their holy prayers.</LINE>
<LINE>Thou shalt not sigh, nor hold thy stumps to heaven,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor wink, nor nod, nor kneel, nor make a sign,</LINE>
<LINE>But I, of these, will wrest an alphabet,</LINE>
<LINE>And by still practice learn to know thy meaning.</LINE>

<LINE>And buzz lamenting doings in the air!</LINE>
<LINE>Poor harmless fly,</LINE>
<LINE>That, with his pretty buzzing melody,</LINE>
<LINE>Came here to make us merry! And thou hast kill&#8217;d him.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pardon me, sir, it was a black ill-favor&#8217;d fly,</LINE>

<LINE>O, O, O,</LINE>

<LINE>Come hither purposely to poison me.&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>There&#8217;s for thyself, and that&#8217;s for Tamora.</LINE>

<LINE>Help, grandsire, help! My aunt Lavinia</LINE>

<LINE>See, Lucius, see, how much she makes of thee;</LINE>
<LINE>Somewhither would she have thee go with her.</LINE>
<LINE>Ah, boy, Cornelia never with more care</LINE>
<LINE>Read to her sons than she hath read to thee</LINE>
<LINE>Sweet poetry and Tully&#8217;s Orator.</LINE>
<LINE>Canst thou not guess wherefore she plies thee thus?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BOY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, I know not, I, nor can I guess,</LINE>
<LINE>Unless some fit or frenzy do possess her;</LINE>
<LINE>For I have heard my grandsire say full oft,</LINE>
<LINE>Extremity of griefs would make men mad;</LINE>
<LINE>And I have read that Hecuba of Troy</LINE>
<LINE>Ran mad for sorrow. That made me to fear,</LINE>
<LINE>Although, my lord, I know my noble aunt</LINE>
<LINE>Loves me as dear as e&#8217;er my mother did,</LINE>
<LINE>And would not, but in fury, fright my youth,</LINE>
<LINE>Which made me down to throw my books, and fly&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Causeless, perhaps. But pardon me, sweet aunt,</LINE>
<LINE>And, madam, if my uncle Marcus go,</LINE>

<LINE>Which is it, girl, of these?&#8212;Open them, boy.&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>But thou art deeper read, and better skill&#8217;d;</LINE>
<LINE>Come and take choice of all my library,</LINE>
<LINE>And so beguile thy sorrow, till the heavens</LINE>
<LINE>Reveal the damn&#8217;d contriver of this deed.</LINE>
<LINE>Why lifts she up her arms in sequence thus?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I think she means that there were more than one</LINE>
<LINE>Confederate in the fact; ay, more there was;</LINE>

<LINE>Soft, so busily she turns the leaves! Help her.</LINE>
<LINE>What would she find? Lavinia, shall I read?</LINE>
<LINE>This is the tragic tale of Philomel,</LINE>

<LINE>And substituted in the place of mine,</LINE>

<LINE>Hark ye, lords, you see I have given her physic,</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Emperor and Empress and her two sons (Demetrius and Chiron), Lords, and others; the Emperor brings the arrow in his hand that Titus shot at him.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SAT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, lords, what wrongs are these! Was ever seen</LINE>
<LINE>An emperor in Rome thus overborne,</LINE>
<LINE>Troubled, confronted thus, and, for the extent</LINE>
<LINE>Of egall justice, us&#8217;d in such contempt?</LINE>
<LINE>My lords, you know, as know the mightful gods,</LINE>
<LINE>However these disturbers of our peace</LINE>
<LINE>Buzz in the people&#8217;s ears, there nought hath pass&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>But even with law, against the willful sons</LINE>
<LINE>Of old Andronicus. And what and if</LINE>
<LINE>His sorrows have so overwhelm&#8217;d his wits?</LINE>
<LINE>Shall we be thus afflicted in his wreaks,</LINE>
<LINE>His fits, his frenzy, and his bitterness?</LINE>
<LINE>And now he writes to heaven for his redress.</LINE>
<LINE>See, here&#8217;s to Jove, and this to Mercury,</LINE>
<LINE>This to Apollo, this to the god of war:</LINE>
<LINE>Sweet scrolls to fly about the streets of Rome!</LINE>
<LINE>What&#8217;s this but libelling against the Senate,</LINE>
<LINE>And blazoning our unjustice every where?</LINE>
<LINE>A goodly humor, is it not, my lords?</LINE>
<LINE>As who would say, in Rome no justice were.</LINE>
<LINE>But if I live, his feigned ecstasies</LINE>
<LINE>Shall be no shelter to these outrages,</LINE>
<LINE>But he and his shall know that justice lives</LINE>
<LINE>In Saturninus&#8217; health, whom, if he sleep,</LINE>
<LINE>He&#8217;ll so awake as he in fury shall</LINE>
<LINE>Cut off the proud&#8217;st conspirator that lives.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My gracious lord, my lovely Saturnine,</LINE>
<LINE>Lord of my life, commander of my thoughts,</LINE>
<LINE>Calm thee, and bear the faults of Titus&#8217; age,</LINE>
<LINE>Th&#8217; effects of sorrow for his valiant sons,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose loss hath pierc&#8217;d him deep and scarr&#8217;d his heart,</LINE>
<LINE>And rather comfort his distressed plight</LINE>
<LINE>Than prosecute the meanest or the best</LINE>
<LINE>For these contempts.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Aside.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE offset="5">Why, thus it shall become</LINE>
<LINE>High-witted Tamora to gloze with all;</LINE>
<LINE>But, Titus, I have touch&#8217;d thee to the quick;</LINE>
<LINE>Thy life-blood out, if Aaron now be wise,</LINE>
<LINE>Then is all safe, the anchor in the port.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Clown.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>How now, good fellow, wouldst thou speak with us?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yea forsooth, and your mistriship be emperial.</LINE>

<LINE>Empress I am, but yonder sits the Emperor.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis he. God and Saint Steven give you godde. I have brought you a letter and a couple of pigeons here.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Saturninus reads the letter.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Come, sirrah, you must be hang&#8217;d.</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Hang&#8217;d! By&#8217; lady, then I have brought up a neck to a fair end.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit guarded.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SAT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Despiteful and intolerable wrongs!</LINE>
<LINE>Shall I endure this monstrous villainy?</LINE>
<LINE>I know from whence this same device proceeds.</LINE>
<LINE>May this be borne as if his traitorous sons,</LINE>
<LINE>That died by law for murder of our brother,</LINE>
<LINE>Have by my means been butchered wrongfully?</LINE>
<LINE>Go drag the villain hither by the hair,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor age nor honor shall shape privilege;</LINE>
<LINE>For this proud mock I&#8217;ll be thy slaughter-man,</LINE>
<LINE>Sly frantic wretch, that holp&#8217;st to make me great,</LINE>
<LINE>In hope thyself should govern Rome and me.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Nuntius Aemilius.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>What news with thee, Aemilius?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AEMIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Arm, my lords! Rome never had more cause.</LINE>
<LINE>The Goths have gathered head, and with a power</LINE>
<LINE>Of high-resolved men, bent to the spoil,</LINE>
<LINE>They hither march amain, under conduct</LINE>
<LINE>Of Lucius, son to old Andronicus,</LINE>
<LINE>Who threats, in course of this revenge, to do</LINE>
<LINE>As much as ever Coriolanus did.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SAT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is warlike Lucius general of the Goths?</LINE>
<LINE>These tidings nip me, and I hang the head</LINE>
<LINE>As flowers with frost, or grass beat down with storms.</LINE>
<LINE>Ay, now begins our sorrows to approach.</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis he the common people love so much;</LINE>
<LINE>Myself hath often heard them say,</LINE>
<LINE>When I have walked like a private man,</LINE>
<LINE>That Lucius&#8217; banishment was wrongfully,</LINE>
<LINE>And they have wish&#8217;d that Lucius were their emperor.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why should you fear? Is not your city strong?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SAT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, but the citizens favor Lucius,</LINE>
<LINE>And will revolt from me to succor him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>King, be thy thoughts imperious, like thy name.</LINE>
<LINE>Is the sun dimm&#8217;d, that gnats do fly in it?</LINE>
<LINE>The eagle suffers little birds to sing,</LINE>
<LINE>And is not careful what they mean thereby,</LINE>
<LINE>Knowing that with the shadow of his wings</LINE>
<LINE>He can at pleasure stint their melody;</LINE>
<LINE>Even so mayest thou the giddy men of Rome.</LINE>
<LINE>Then cheer thy spirit, for know thou, Emperor,</LINE>
<LINE>I will enchant the old Andronicus</LINE>
<LINE>With words more sweet, and yet more dangerous,</LINE>
<LINE>Than baits to fish, or honey-stalks to sheep,</LINE>
<LINE>When as the one is wounded with the bait,</LINE>
<LINE>The other rotted with delicious feed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SAT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But he will not entreat his son for us.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If Tamora entreat him, then he will,</LINE>
<LINE>For I can smooth and fill his aged ears</LINE>
<LINE>With golden promises, that, were his heart</LINE>
<LINE>Almost impregnable, his old years deaf,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet should both ear and heart obey my tongue.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>To Aemilius.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Go thou before, to be our ambassador.</LINE>
<LINE>Say that the Emperor requests a parley</LINE>
<LINE>Of warlike Lucius, and appoint the meeting</LINE>
<LINE>Even at his father&#8217;s house, the old Andronicus.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SAT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Aemilius, do this message honorably,</LINE>
<LINE>And if he stand on hostage for his safety,</LINE>
<LINE>Bid him demand what pledge will please him best.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AEMIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your bidding shall I do effectually.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now will I to that old Andronicus,</LINE>
<LINE>And temper him with all the art I have,</LINE>
<LINE>To pluck proud Lucius from the warlike Goths,</LINE>
<LINE>And now, sweet emperor, be blithe again,</LINE>
<LINE>And bury all thy fear in my devices.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SAT.</SPEAKER>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Approved warriors, and my faithful friends,</LINE>
<LINE>I have received letters from great Rome</LINE>
<LINE>Which signifies what hate they bear their emperor,</LINE>
<LINE>And how desirous of our sight they are.</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore, great lords, be as your titles witness,</LINE>

<LINE>Brave slip, sprung from the great Andronicus,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose name was once our terror, now our comfort,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose high exploits and honorable deeds</LINE>
<LINE>Ingrateful Rome requites with foul contempt,</LINE>
<LINE>Be bold in us, we&#8217;ll follow where thou lead&#8217;st,</LINE>
<LINE>Like stinging bees in hottest summer&#8217;s day,</LINE>
<LINE>Led by their master to the flow&#8217;red fields,</LINE>
<LINE>And be adveng&#8217;d on cursed Tamora.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>3. GOTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And as he saith, so say we all with him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I humbly thank him, and I thank you all.</LINE>
<LINE>But who comes here, led by a lusty Goth?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter a Goth leading of Aaron with his child in his arms.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. GOTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Renowmed Lucius, from our troops I stray&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>To gaze upon a ruinous monastery,</LINE>
<LINE>And as I earnestly did fix mine eye</LINE>
<LINE>Upon the wasted building, suddenly</LINE>
<LINE>I heard a child cry underneath a wall.</LINE>
<LINE>I made unto the noise, when soon I heard</LINE>
<LINE>The crying babe controll&#8217;d with this discourse:</LINE>
<LINE>&#8220;Peace, tawny slave, half me and half thy dame.</LINE>
<LINE>Did not thy hue bewray whose brat thou art,</LINE>
<LINE>Had nature lent thee but thy mother&#8217;s look,</LINE>
<LINE>Villain, thou mightst have been an emperor.</LINE>
<LINE>But where the bull and cow are both milk-white,</LINE>
<LINE>They never do beget a coal-black calf.</LINE>
<LINE>Peace, villain, peace!&#8221;&#8212;even thus he rates the babe&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>&#8220;For I must bear thee to a trusty Goth,</LINE>
<LINE>Who, when he knows thou art the Empress&#8217; babe,</LINE>
<LINE>Will hold thee dearly for thy mother&#8217;s sake.&#8221;</LINE>
<LINE>With this, my weapon drawn, I rush&#8217;d upon him,</LINE>
<LINE>Surpris&#8217;d him suddenly, and brought him hither</LINE>
<LINE>To use as you think needful of the man.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O worthy Goth, this is the incarnate devil</LINE>
<LINE>That robb&#8217;d Andronicus of his good hand;</LINE>
<LINE>This is the pearl that pleas&#8217;d your empress&#8217; eye,</LINE>
<LINE>And here&#8217;s the base fruit of her burning lust.</LINE>
<LINE>Say, wall-ey&#8217;d slave, whither wouldst thou convey</LINE>
<LINE>This growing image of thy fiend-like face?</LINE>
<LINE>Why dost not speak? What, deaf? Not a word?</LINE>
<LINE>A halter, soldiers! Hang him on this tree,</LINE>
<LINE>And by his side his fruit of bastardy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Touch not the boy, he is of royal blood.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Too like the sire forever being good.</LINE>
<LINE>First hang the child, that he may see it sprawl&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>A sight to vex the father&#8217;s soul withal.</LINE>
<LINE>Get me a ladder.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>A ladder brought, which Aaron is made to ascend.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Lucius, save the child</LINE>
<LINE>And bear it from me to the Emperess.</LINE>
<LINE>If thou do this, I&#8217;ll show thee wondrous things,</LINE>
<LINE>That highly may advantage thee to hear.</LINE>
<LINE>If thou wilt not, befall what may befall,</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll speak no more but &#8220;Vengeance rot you all!&#8221;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Say on, and if it please me which thou speak&#8217;st,</LINE>
<LINE>Thy child shall live, and I will see it nourish&#8217;d.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And if it please thee? Why, assure thee, Lucius,</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Twill vex thy soul to hear what I shall speak:</LINE>
<LINE>For I must talk of murders, rapes, and massacres,</LINE>
<LINE>Acts of black night, abominable deeds,</LINE>
<LINE>Complots of mischief, treason, villainies,</LINE>
<LINE>Ruthful to hear, yet piteously perform&#8217;d.</LINE>
<LINE>And this shall all be buried in my death,</LINE>
<LINE>Unless thou swear to me my child shall live.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tell on thy mind, I say thy child shall live.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Swear that he shall, and then I will begin.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who should I swear by? Thou believest no god:</LINE>
<LINE>That granted, how canst thou believe an oath?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What if I do not? As indeed I do not,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet for I know thou art religious,</LINE>
<LINE>And hast a thing within thee called conscience,</LINE>
<LINE>With twenty popish tricks and ceremonies,</LINE>
<LINE>Which I have seen thee careful to observe,</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore I urge thy oath; for that I know</LINE>
<LINE>An idiot holds his bauble for a god,</LINE>
<LINE>And keeps the oath which by that god he swears,</LINE>
<LINE>To that I&#8217;ll urge him: therefore thou shalt vow</LINE>
<LINE>By that same god, what god soe&#8217;er it be</LINE>
<LINE>That thou adorest and hast in reverence,</LINE>
<LINE>To save my boy, to nourish and bring him up,</LINE>
<LINE>Or else I will discover nought to thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Even by my God I swear to thee I will.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>First know thou, I begot him on the Empress.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O most insatiate and luxurious woman!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tut, Lucius, this was but a deed of charity</LINE>
<LINE>To that which thou shalt hear of me anon.</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Twas her two sons that murdered Bassianus;</LINE>
<LINE>They cut thy sister&#8217;s tongue, and ravish&#8217;d her,</LINE>
<LINE>And cut her hands, and trimm&#8217;d her as thou sawest.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O detestable villain, call&#8217;st thou that trimming?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, she was wash&#8217;d, and cut, and trimm&#8217;d, and &#8217;twas</LINE>
<LINE>Trim sport for them which had the doing of it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O barbarous, beastly villains like thyself!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Indeed I was their tutor to instruct them.</LINE>
<LINE>That codding spirit had they from their mother,</LINE>
<LINE>As sure a card as ever won the set;</LINE>
<LINE>That bloody mind I think they learn&#8217;d of me,</LINE>
<LINE>As true a dog as ever fought at head.</LINE>
<LINE>Well, let my deeds be witness of my worth:</LINE>
<LINE>I train&#8217;d thy brethren to that guileful hole,</LINE>
<LINE>Where the dead corpse of Bassianus lay;</LINE>
<LINE>I wrote the letter that thy father found,</LINE>
<LINE>And hid the gold within that letter mentioned,</LINE>
<LINE>Confederate with the Queen and her two sons;</LINE>
<LINE>And what not done, that thou hast cause to rue,</LINE>
<LINE>Wherein I had no stroke of mischief in it?</LINE>
<LINE>I play&#8217;d the cheater for thy father&#8217;s hand,</LINE>
<LINE>And when I had it, drew myself apart,</LINE>
<LINE>And almost broke my heart with extreme laughter.</LINE>
<LINE>I pried me through the crevice of a wall,</LINE>
<LINE>When, for his hand, he had his two sons&#8217; heads,</LINE>
<LINE>Beheld his tears, and laugh&#8217;d so heartily</LINE>
<LINE>That both mine eyes were rainy like to his;</LINE>
<LINE>And when I told the Empress of this sport,</LINE>
<LINE>She sounded almost at my pleasing tale,</LINE>
<LINE>And for my tidings gave me twenty kisses.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. GOTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, canst thou say all this and never blush?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, like a black dog, as the saying is.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Are thou not sorry for these heinous deeds?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, that I had not done a thousand more.</LINE>
<LINE>Even now I curse the day&#8212;and yet I think</LINE>
<LINE>Few come within the compass of my curse&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Wherein I did not some notorious ill:</LINE>
<LINE>As kill a man, or else devise his death,</LINE>
<LINE>Ravish a maid, or plot the way to do it,</LINE>
<LINE>Accuse some innocent, and forswear myself,</LINE>
<LINE>Set deadly enmity between two friends,</LINE>
<LINE>Make poor men&#8217;s cattle break their necks,</LINE>
<LINE>Set fire on barns and haystalks in the night,</LINE>
<LINE>And bid the owners quench them with their tears.</LINE>
<LINE>Oft have I digg&#8217;d up dead men from their graves,</LINE>
<LINE>And set them upright at their dear friends&#8217; door,</LINE>
<LINE>Even when their sorrows almost was forgot,</LINE>
<LINE>And on their skins, as on the bark of trees,</LINE>
<LINE>Have with my knife carved in Roman letters,</LINE>
<LINE>&#8220;Let not your sorrow die, though I am dead.&#8221;</LINE>
<LINE>But I have done a thousand dreadful things,</LINE>
<LINE>As willingly as one would kill a fly,</LINE>
<LINE>And nothing grieves me heartily indeed,</LINE>
<LINE>But that I cannot do ten thousand more.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Bring down the devil, for he must not die</LINE>
<LINE>So sweet a death as hanging presently.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If there be devils, would I were a devil,</LINE>
<LINE>To live and burn in everlasting fire,</LINE>
<LINE>So I might have your company in hell,</LINE>
<LINE>But to torment you with my bitter tongue!</LINE>

<LINE>Stab them, or tear them on thy chariot-wheels,</LINE>
<LINE>And then I&#8217;ll come and be thy waggoner,</LINE>
<LINE>And whirl along with thee about the globes.</LINE>
<LINE>Provide thee two proper palfreys, black as jet,</LINE>
<LINE>To hale thy vengeful waggon swift away,</LINE>
<LINE>And find out murderers in their guilty caves;</LINE>
<LINE>And when thy car is loaden with their heads,</LINE>
<LINE>I will dismount, and by thy waggon-wheel</LINE>
<LINE>Trot like a servile footman all day long,</LINE>
<LINE>Even from Hyperion&#8217;s rising in the east,</LINE>

<LINE>This closing with him fits his lunacy.</LINE>
<LINE>What e&#8217;er I forge to feed his brain-sick humors,</LINE>
<LINE>Do you uphold and maintain in your speeches,</LINE>
<LINE>For now he firmly takes me for Revenge,</LINE>
<LINE>And being credulous in this mad thought,</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll make him send for Lucius his son;</LINE>
<LINE>And whilst I at a banquet hold him sure,</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll find some cunning practice out of hand,</LINE>
<LINE>To scatter and disperse the giddy Goths,</LINE>
<LINE>Or at the least make them his enemies.</LINE>
<LINE>See here he comes, and I must ply my theme.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>How like the Empress and her sons you are!</LINE>
<LINE>Well are you fitted, had you but a Moor.</LINE>
<LINE>Could not all hell afford you such a devil?</LINE>
<LINE>For well I wot the Empress never wags</LINE>
<LINE>But in her company there is a Moor;</LINE>

<LINE>Go thou with them, and in the Emperor&#8217;s court</LINE>
<LINE>There is a queen, attended by a Moor;</LINE>
<LINE>Well shalt thou know her by thine own proportion,</LINE>
<LINE>For up and down she doth resemble thee.</LINE>
<LINE>I pray thee do on them some violent death,</LINE>
<LINE>They have been violent to me and mine.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>TAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well hast thou lesson&#8217;d us, this shall we do.</LINE>

<LINE>When he is here, even at thy solemn feast,</LINE>
<LINE>I will bring in the Empress and her sons,</LINE>

<LINE>O villains, Chiron and Demetrius!</LINE>
<LINE>Here stands the spring whom you have stain&#8217;d with mud,</LINE>
<LINE>This goodly summer with your winter mix&#8217;d.</LINE>
<LINE>You kill&#8217;d her husband, and for that vild fault</LINE>
<LINE>Two of her brothers were condemn&#8217;d to death,</LINE>
<LINE>My hand cut off and made a merry jest;</LINE>
<LINE>Both her sweet hands, her tongue, and that more dear</LINE>
<LINE>Than hands or tongue, her spotless chastity,</LINE>
<LINE>Inhuman traitors, you constrain&#8217;d and forc&#8217;d.</LINE>
<LINE>What would you say if I should let you speak?</LINE>
<LINE>Villains, for shame you could not beg for grace.</LINE>
<LINE>Hark, wretches, how I mean to martyr you.</LINE>
<LINE>This one hand yet is left to cut your throats,</LINE>
<LINE>Whiles that Lavinia &#8217;tween her stumps doth hold</LINE>
<LINE>The basin that receives your guilty blood.</LINE>
<LINE>You know your mother means to feast with me,</LINE>
<LINE>And calls herself Revenge, and thinks me mad.</LINE>
<LINE>Hark, villains, I will grind your bones to dust,</LINE>
<LINE>And with your blood and it I&#8217;ll make a paste,</LINE>
<LINE>And of the paste a coffin I will rear,</LINE>
<LINE>And make two pasties of your shameful heads,</LINE>
<LINE>And bid that strumpet, your unhallowed dam,</LINE>
<LINE>Like to the earth swallow her own increase.</LINE>
<LINE>This is the feast that I have bid her to,</LINE>
<LINE>And this the banquet she shall surfeit on,</LINE>
<LINE>For worse than Philomel you us&#8217;d my daughter,</LINE>
<LINE>And worse than Progne I will be reveng&#8217;d.</LINE>
<LINE>And now prepare your throats. Lavinia, come,</LINE>
<LINE>Receive the blood, and when that they are dead,</LINE>
<LINE>Let me go grind their bones to powder small,</LINE>
<LINE>And with this hateful liquor temper it,</LINE>
<LINE>And in that paste let their vile heads be bak&#8217;d.</LINE>
<LINE>Come, come, be every one officious</LINE>

<LINE>And if your Highness knew my heart, you were.</LINE>
<LINE>My Lord the Emperor, resolve me this:</LINE>
<LINE>Was it well done of rash Virginius</LINE>
<LINE>To slay his daughter with his own right hand,</LINE>
<LINE>Because she was enforc&#8217;d, stain&#8217;d, and deflow&#8217;r&#8217;d?</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your reason, mighty lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Because the girl should not survive her shame,</LINE>

<LINE>Scatter&#8217;d by winds and high tempestuous gusts,</LINE>

<LINE>These broken limbs again into one body.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AEMIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let Rome herself be bane unto herself,</LINE>
<LINE>And she whom mighty kingdoms cur&#8217;sy to,</LINE>
<LINE>Like a forlorn and desperate castaway,</LINE>
<LINE>Do shameful execution on herself,</LINE>
<LINE>But if my frosty signs and chaps of age,</LINE>
<LINE>Grave witnesses of true experience,</LINE>
<LINE>Cannot induce you to attend my words.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>To Lucius.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Speak, Rome&#8217;s dear friend, as erst our ancestor,</LINE>
<LINE>When with his solemn tongue he did discourse</LINE>
<LINE>To love-sick Dido&#8217;s sad attending ear</LINE>
<LINE>The story of that baleful burning night,</LINE>
<LINE>When subtile Greeks surpris&#8217;d King Priam&#8217;s Troy.</LINE>
<LINE>Tell us what Sinon hath bewitch&#8217;d our ears,</LINE>
<LINE>Or who hath brought the fatal engine in</LINE>
<LINE>That gives our Troy, our Rome, the civil wound.</LINE>
<LINE>My heart is not compact of flint nor steel,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor can I utter all our bitter grief,</LINE>
<LINE>But floods of tears will drown my oratory,</LINE>
<LINE>And break my utt&#8217;rance, even in the time</LINE>
<LINE>When it should move ye to attend me most,</LINE>
<LINE>And force you to commiseration.</LINE>
<LINE>Here&#8217;s Rome&#8217;s young captain, let him tell the tale,</LINE>
<LINE>While I stand by and weep to hear him speak.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then, gracious auditory, be it known to you</LINE>
<LINE>That Chiron and the damn&#8217;d Demetrius</LINE>
<LINE>Were they that murd&#8217;red our Emperor&#8217;s brother,</LINE>
<LINE>And they it were that ravished our sister.</LINE>
<LINE>For their fell faults our brothers were beheaded,</LINE>
<LINE>Our father&#8217;s tears despis&#8217;d, and basely cozen&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>Of that true hand that fought Rome&#8217;s quarrel out,</LINE>
<LINE>And sent her enemies unto the grave.</LINE>
<LINE>Lastly, myself unkindly banished,</LINE>
<LINE>The gates shut on me, and turn&#8217;d weeping out</LINE>
<LINE>To beg relief among Rome&#8217;s enemies,</LINE>
<LINE>Who drown&#8217;d their enmity in my true tears,</LINE>
<LINE>And op&#8217;d their arms to embrace me as a friend.</LINE>
<LINE>I am the turned forth, be it known to you,</LINE>
<LINE>That have preserv&#8217;d her welfare in my blood,</LINE>
<LINE>And from her bosom took the enemy&#8217;s point,</LINE>
<LINE>Sheathing the steel in my advent&#8217;rous body.</LINE>
<LINE>Alas, you know I am no vaunter, I;</LINE>
<LINE>My scars can witness, dumb although they are,</LINE>
<LINE>That my report is just and full of truth.</LINE>
<LINE>But soft, methinks I do digress too much,</LINE>
<LINE>Citing my worthless praise. O, pardon me,</LINE>
<LINE>For when no friends are by, men praise themselves.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now is my turn to speak. Behold the child:</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Pointing to Aaron&#8217;s child in the arms of an Attendant.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Of this was Tamora delivered,</LINE>
<LINE>The issue of an irreligious Moor,</LINE>
<LINE>Chief architect and plotter of these woes.</LINE>
<LINE>The villain is alive in Titus&#8217; house,</LINE>
<LINE>And as he is to witness, this is true.</LINE>
<LINE>Now judge what cause had Titus to revenge</LINE>
<LINE>These wrongs unspeakable, past patience,</LINE>
<LINE>Or more than any living man could bear.</LINE>
<LINE>Now have you heard the truth, what say you, Romans?</LINE>
<LINE>Have we done aught amiss, show us wherein,</LINE>
<LINE>And, from the place where you behold us pleading,</LINE>
<LINE>The poor remainder of Andronici</LINE>
<LINE>Will hand in hand all headlong hurl ourselves,</LINE>
<LINE>And on the ragged stones beat forth our souls,</LINE>
<LINE>And make a mutual closure of our house.</LINE>
<LINE>Speak, Romans, speak, and if you say we shall,</LINE>
<LINE>Lo hand in hand Lucius and I will fall.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>For nature puts me to a heavy task.</LINE>
<LINE>Stand all aloof, but, uncle, draw you near</LINE>
<LINE>To shed obsequious tears upon this trunk.</LINE>
<LINE>O, take this warm kiss on thy pale cold lips,</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Kisses Titus.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>These sorrowful drops upon thy blood-stain&#8217;d face,</LINE>
<LINE>The last true duties of thy noble son!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tear for tear, and loving kiss for kiss,</LINE>
<LINE>Thy brother Marcus tenders on thy lips.</LINE>
<LINE>O, were the sum of these that I should pay</LINE>
<LINE>Countless and infinite, yet would I pay them!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come hither, boy, come, come, and learn of us</LINE>
<LINE>To melt in showers; thy grandsire lov&#8217;d thee well.</LINE>
<LINE>Many a time he danc&#8217;d thee on his knee,</LINE>
<LINE>Sung thee asleep, his loving breast thy pillow;</LINE>
<LINE>Many a story hath he told to thee,</LINE>
<LINE>And bid thee bear his pretty tales in mind,</LINE>
<LINE>And talk of them when he was dead and gone.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MARC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How many thousand times hath these poor lips,</LINE>
<LINE>When they were living, warm&#8217;d themselves on thine!</LINE>
<LINE>O now, sweet boy, give them their latest kiss!</LINE>
<LINE>Bid him farewell, commit him to the grave,</LINE>
<LINE>Do them that kindness, and take leave of them.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BOY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O grandsire, grandsire, ev&#8217;n with all my heart</LINE>
<LINE>Would I were dead, so you did live again!</LINE>
<LINE>O Lord, I cannot speak to him for weeping,</LINE>
<LINE>My tears will choke me if I ope my mouth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Attendants with Aaron.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AEMIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You sad Andronici, have done with woes.</LINE>
<LINE>Give sentence on this execrable wretch</LINE>
<LINE>That hath been breeder of these dire events.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Set him breast-deep in earth and famish him,</LINE>
<LINE>There let him stand and rave and cry for food.</LINE>
<LINE>If any one relieves or pities him,</LINE>
<LINE>For the offense he dies. This is our doom.</LINE>
<LINE>Some stay to see him fast&#8217;ned in the earth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ah, why should wrath be mute and fury dumb?</LINE>
<LINE>I am no baby, I, that with base prayers</LINE>
<LINE>I should repent the evils I have done.</LINE>
<LINE>Ten thousand worse than ever yet I did</LINE>
<LINE>Would I perform if I might have my will.</LINE>
<LINE>If one good deed in all my life I did,</LINE>
<LINE>I do repent it from my very soul.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Some loving friends convey the Emperor hence,</LINE>
<LINE>And give him burial in his fathers&#8217; grave.</LINE>
<LINE>My father and Lavinia shall forthwith</LINE>
<LINE>Be closed in our household&#8217;s monument.</LINE>
<LINE>As for that ravenous tiger Tamora,</LINE>
<LINE>No funeral rite, nor man in mourning weed,</LINE>
<LINE>No mournful bell shall ring her burial,</LINE>
<LINE>But throw her forth to beasts and birds to prey:</LINE>
<LINE>Her life was beastly and devoid of pity,</LINE>
<LINE>And being dead, let birds on her take pity.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt.</STAGEDIR>
