<persona gender="male">
<persname short="SAT.">Saturninus</persname>
<persdescription>Saturninus is the elder son of the deceased Emperor of Rome and a candidate for his throne, who appeals to the old aristocracy as being the elder son. A young man, he proves to be untrustworthy, ungrateful, quarrelsome, lascivious and tyrannical. He disregards the old traditions of Rome, attempting to marry his brother&#8217;s betrothed, and shows no gratitude to Titus, to whom he owes the crown, even marrying the chief prisoner he brings home from his wars against the Goths. Saturninus is completely under Tamora&#8217;s spell, allowing the older woman to lead him by the nose and propose policy without the Emperor realizing that she is cheating on him. Not at all popular with the common people, Saturninus is afraid of them, and fears also losing his throne. He is more weak than evil, unwilling to see past the immediate appearance of things and taking the easiest course out. He is truly horrified at the murder of his brother Bassianus, even though he did not like said brother, and likewise at the guilt of his stepsons Demetrius and Chiron in Lavinia&#8217;s rape and Titus&#8217;s killing of the latter. He is not the happiest of men.</persdescription>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="BAS.">Bassianus</persname>
<persdescription>Bassianus is the younger son of the deceased Emperor of Rome, and a candidate for his throne, who appeals to the common people as being a better man than his brother Saturninus. Despite this vaunted ethical superiority, he is quite willing to offer a bribe to Titus when the old man becomes the one to choose who shall be Emperor. This does him no good. He accepts Titus&#8217;s decision, but cannot stomach it when Saturninus attempts to steal his fianc&#233;e Lavinia, and runs off with her. He is a good-natured and honorable man who pleads for Titus even though the old man does not want his help. He also despises both Tamora and Aaron, which unfortunately leads to his being murdered and tossed into a pit. He is a passionate man.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="TIT.">Titus Andronicus</persname>
<persdescription>Titus Andronicus is an old man, the head of the powerful Andronicus family, and a lifelong soldier. Deeply conservative, he is rigid, uncompromising, unsentimental, proud, religious, concerned for his family honor and possessed of a truly military respect for doing things the right way. Offered the possibility of becoming Emperor, he rejects it, refuses Bassianus&#8217;s offer of a bribe, and gives in to his knee-jerk reaction of making the elder son of the dead Emperor the new monarch, despite Saturninus&#8217;s evident unworthiness. One of the great soldiers of the age, Titus had 25 sons, 21 of whom are dead in the wars, and one daughter, Lavinia. His stiff-necked refusal to show mercy to Tamora and her sons dooms almost his entire family, while his trust in serving the Emperor no matter what leaves him vulnerable when Saturninus rejects him. A ruthless man, Titus kills his own son Mutius when he gets in his way and attempts to reject his entire family when they disapprove of his actions, including at first refusing to let them bury Mutius honorably. As the events of the play progress and prove that Titus&#8217;s well-ordered world does not work the way it should, the old man&#8217;s grasp on reality begins to waver. Just how far he progresses on the road to madness is a matter of opinion &#8212; though he shoots arrows with messages to the gods, he also recognizes Tamora in her disguise as Revenge. Not a man to do things by halves, he plots an extreme revenge on the Queen of Goths for what she does to him. Though he can never quite be accused of self-pity &#8212; he has reasons enough to grumble &#8212; he does spend rather a lot of time complaining. He loves his grandson Young Lucius a great deal.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="MARC.">Marcus Andronicus</persname>
<persdescription>Marcus Andronicus is a Tribune of the People, Publius&#8217;s father, and Titus&#8217;s younger brother, the political face of the powerful Andronicus family. He announces and approves the nomination of his brother as Emperor, but accepts it when Titus chooses not to take the opportunity. He is appalled at Titus&#8217;s killing of Mutius and his refusal to let him be honorably buried. He attempts to make Titus somewhat more flexible, though he is not overly successful at this. He loves his niece Lavinia and is horrified when he finds her mutilated; as further blows fall on the family, he is brought to the edge of despair. He recovers somewhat, and is able to work out a way to communicate with Lavinia. He is probably the most intelligent of the Andronici, though this does not do him much good. He does what he can to control Titus when the latter essentially loses his mind, but does not in any way contradict him. He arranges for the meeting at Titus&#8217;s house and plays the honest broker at the feast. How much he knows of Titus&#8217;s plans for this meal is unknown, as he misses the murder of Chiron and Demetrius. Still, after everyone is dead, Marcus is finally able to get a family member named Emperor of Rome.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="LUC.">Lucius</persname>
<persdescription>Lucius is the eldest of Titus&#8217;s living sons, a strong soldier and a popular man. As uncompromising as his father, Lucius insists on sacrificing a Goth prisoner for his brothers&#8217; funeral. He refuses to accept that his sister Lavinia be taken from her fianc&#233; Bassianus and given to the new Emperor, Saturninus, instead. Hot-headed and quick to act on what he perceives is right, he attempts to save his two brothers Quintus and Marius from execution, leading to his banishment. He is a widower with a son of his own, Young Lucius. He is able to convince the Goths to accept him and leader despite being the son of their greatest enemy and to follow him in a war against their former Queen, Tamora. Named Emperor by the people after the final slaughter, he proves not to be a forgiving man.</persdescription>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="QUIN.">Quintus</persname>
<persdescription>Quintus is Titus&#8217;s fifth son, a soldier who follows his elder brother Lucius&#8217;s lead. He joins with the others in keeping Lavinia from being given to Saturninus and in insisting that Mutius receive proper burial. The sight of his brother Martius being afraid chills him. Framed for Bassianus&#8217;s murder, he is executed on the Emperor&#8217;s orders.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="MART.">Martius</persname>
<persdescription>Martius is one of Titus&#8217;s sons, a soldier who follows his elder brother Lucius&#8217;s lead. He joins with the others in keeping Lavinia from being given to Saturninus and in insisting that Mutius receive proper burial.

</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="MUT.">Mutius</persname>
<persdescription>Mutius is one of Titus&#8217;s sons, a soldier who follows his elder brother Lucius&#8217;s lead. He joins with the others in keeping Lavinia from being given to Saturninus, acting as guard against any followers, with the result that he is killed by his father.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="Y. LUC.">Young Lucius</persname>
<persdescription>Young Lucius is Titus&#8217;s grandson, the son of Lucius. He does not think that his grandfather&#8217;s lamenting is doing anyone much good. He is somewhat terrified of his mutilated aunt Lavinia, whom he loves but fears has gone mad. Still a schoolboy, he is attentive to good storytelling and myths, which both Titus and Lavinia told him in better days, for which he loved them. He has his father&#8217;s hot temper and is quite ready to kill others, were it not that he is physically weak. He cannot quite dissemble his hatred of Chiron, Demetrius and Aaron, but manages to deceive them all the same. He is a good archer. He is heart-broken by Titus&#8217;s death, though he does end up as potential heir to the throne of Rome.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="AEMIL.">Aemilius</persname>
<persdescription>Aemilius is a noble Roman used as go-between for the Goths and Romans. He brings the news of Lucius&#8217;s generalship of the Goths and their coming attack to Saturninus, and arranges the meeting between Goth leaders and the Emperor at Titus&#8217;s house. After the slaughter is over, he nominates Lucius as the new Emperor.</persdescription>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="PUB.">Publius</persname>
<persdescription>Publius is Marcus&#8217;s son. He helps his father keep an eye on his uncle Titus when the latter essentially loses his mind. He helps to capture Chiron and Demetrius and prepare them for their slaughter.</persdescription>

<persname short="ALAR.">Alarbus</persname>
<persdescription>Alarbus [mute role] is Tamora&#8217;s eldest son, and as such is marked for sacrifice at the funeral of Titus&#8217;s sons. Despite his mother&#8217;s pleas, he is hacked into pieces and his entrails burnt.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="DEM.">Demetrius</persname>
<persdescription>Demetrius is Tamora&#8217;s second son, and rather a lout. Though he voices righteous anger at the sacrificing of his elder brother Alarbus, that is the last time he appears serious. He is a quarrelsome, lascivious, and violent boy, with very low opinions on women &#8212; though he does love his mother. He is willing to share with his younger brother Chiron, though he thinks himself better due to be the elder. Together they are led by their mother&#8217;s lover Aaron. Demetrius does not approve of that relationship when he learns of it. He is not very bright, and does not realize that Titus might be dangerous, no more than he realizes just how far Aaron is willing to go in villainy. He believes that having his mother as wife of the Emperor gives him leave to do whatsoever he pleases. Acting on this belief ends up getting him baked into a pie.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="CHI.">Chiron</persname>
<persdescription>Chiron is Tamora&#8217;s youngest son, and rather a lout. He does not appreciate his elder brother&#8217;s insistence that being older should have precedence. He is violent and lascivious, and somewhat more imaginative than his brother, coming up with the idea of raping Lavinia on top of her husband&#8217;s dead body. Still, he is not very bright, following Aaron&#8217;s suggestions and being unable to conceive that Titus might be dangerous. He is horrified to discover that Aaron has been having an affair with Tamora. He believes that having his mother as wife of the Emperor gives him leave to do whatsoever he pleases. Acting on this belief ends up getting him baked into a pie.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="AAR.">Aaron</persname>
<persdescription>Aaron the Moor is a black man captured by Titus among the Goths, and Tamora&#8217;s lover. He is not a very nice man, as he not only enjoys doing evil but also likes to lead others into doing so as well. He encourages Chiron and Demetrius to rape Lavinia rather than attempt to seduce her, and plots the death of Bassianus before framing two of Titus&#8217;s sons for it. If that were not enough, he convinces Titus to chop off his own hand, as far as one can tell simply for his own amusement. He never shows any sign of genuinely caring for another human being until he is suddenly presented with his baby son by Tamora, and decides not to kill it. Running away to save the baby, he is captured by the Goths and finds himself in Lucius&#8217;s power. He proceeds to brag about how evil he is. Whether he tells the truth or is merely bragging is unknown.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="female">
<persname short="TAM.">Tamora</persname>
<persdescription>Tamora is the Queen of the Goths, and the mother of Alarbus, Demetrius and Chiron. Captured in battle along with her sons by Titus, she pleads for the life of her eldest but is rejected, and vows revenge on Titus. An attractive older woman, she attracts the attention of the new and young Emperor of Rome, Saturninus, who marries her. Intelligent, deceitful and dangerous, she is able to lead Saturninus by the nose. He never questions the closeness of her relationship with Aaron the Moor. A vicious woman, she chooses to take her revenge slowly, using her lover Aaron and her sons to break Titus&#8217;s heart and mind, as she sets them to murder, rape, mutilate and frame those he loves best. Her conduct is so appalling that even the Goths are willing to make war on her. She falls pregnant by Aaron and orders him to kill the baby when it turns out to be black. She finally overreaches by thinking that Titus is madder than he is, leading to her sons&#8217; capture and killing. Her reaction to discovering that she is eating her sons&#8217; bodies in a pie is not recorded.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="female">
<persname short="LAV.">Lavinia</persname>
<persdescription>Lavinia is Titus&#8217;s only daughter, a beautiful and chaste young woman who is every conservative father&#8217;s ideal, obedient, quiet, patient, loving, and never a bother to anyone. Extremely passive, she takes few initiatives. Bassianus&#8217;s fianc&#233;e, she says nothing when Titus accepts to give her to Saturninus instead, nor when her brothers carry her off to protect her from this fate. Still, she is capable of sauciness, mocking Tamora when coming across her and Aaron together in the woods. She is quickly reduced to silence again, however, when she is raped on top of her husband&#8217;s dead body, then to prevent her from identifying her violators has her tongue pulled out and her hands cut off. She is a kind and literate woman, fond of her nephew Young Lucius, and manages to use books to explain to her family what has happened to her. She is quite willing to join in Titus&#8217;s revenge on her ravishers, holding the basin to collect their blood when Titus kills them. Her reaction to Titus&#8217;s decision to kill her for her and his honor is not recorded.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="female">
<persname short="NUR.">Nurse</persname>
<persdescription>A Nurse brings Aaron&#8217;s black bastard baby to him so that he can fulfill Tamora&#8217;s orders to kill it. Doing this ends up getting her killed instead. She is distressed by the whole affair, a racist, and doesn&#8217;t consider that Aaron could possibly be dangerous.</persdescription>

<scenelocation>Rome. Before the Capitol.</scenelocation>
<scenepersonae>(Marcus Andronicus, Senators, Saturninus, Followers, Bassianus, Roman Captain, Martius, Mutius, Men, Lucius, Quintus, Titus Andronicus, Tamora, Alarbus, Chiron, Demetrius, Aaron the Moor, Lavinia, Tribune)</scenepersonae>
<scenedescription>The late Emperor&#8217;s sons Saturninus and Bassianus argue for their respective right to the throne, Saturninus calling to the patricians on the basis of his being the eldest while Bassianus calls for freedom. Marcus Andronicus enters and announces that the people have chosen his brother Titus, the victorious general, to be a third candidate for the throne. The two brothers agrees to dismiss their followers and plead their cause to the Senate once Titus arrives. A funeral procession enters: that of Titus&#8217;s sons: of the 25 sons he had, only four are still living. They accompany the coffin, as does Titus himself and his captives from the war against the Goth: the Goth Queen, Tamora, her three sons, and Aaron the Moor. They put the coffin into the tomb, and Lucius calls for the noblest of the Goth prisoners to be sacrificed to appease his dead brothers&#8217; ghosts. Titus lets them take Alarbus, despite Tamora&#8217;s pleading for his life. Alarbus is dragged off and cut into pieces. Titus&#8217;s daughter Lavinia comes to greet him, and he blesses her. Then Marcus comes out of the Senate house with the other Tribunes and the two contenders for the throne. He tells Titus that he could become Emperor, but the old general will have none of it, having no desire to rule. Saturninus complains that Titus has stolen the people&#8217;s love from him and calls on the patricians to fight for him, but Titus promises to calm matters. He asks to be given the sole right to choose the next Emperor, and despite Bassianus&#8217;s attempt to bribe him chooses Saturninus, as being the eldest son. In thanks, Saturninus announcesthat he will marry Lavinia and make her Empress. Titus is flattered and agrees to the match. He hands over his prisoners to the Emperor, who is rather taken with Tamora and admits that he would marry her if he hadn&#8217;t just decided to take Lavinia as his bride. He sets the Goths free without any need of a ransom. While Saturninus courts Tamora, Bassianus seizes his fiancée Lavinia, despite Titus&#8217;s protests; Marcus and Titus&#8217;s sons all swear to help Bassianus keep his own. Titus calls them all traitors and bellows out for the guard; pursuing the fleeing party, he kills his youngest son Mutius when the latter tries to bar his way. He disowns his sons and promises Saturninus that he will get Lavinia back, but the Emperor tells him not to bother. Completely ungrateful, Saturninus scorns Titus and his entire family and chooses to marry Tamora instead. Completely dishonored, he blames his family when they return, and attempts to prevent them from burying Mutius in the family tomb. Marcus finally convinces his brother to let them do so. Saturninus threatens Bassianus for having stolen Lavinia away, but Bassianus is completely unrepentant at having carried off his betrothed, whom he has married. Titus gives him no support. Tamora convinces Saturninus to forgive everyone, whispering to him that his position is still insecure but that they can have their revenge later. The Emperor pronounces his pardon, and Titus invites the court to hunt with them the next day.</scenedescription>

<scenelocation>A lonely part of the forest.</scenelocation>
<scenepersonae>(Aaron the Moor, Tamora, Bassianus, Lavinia, Chiron, Demetrius, Quintus, Martius, Emperor Saturnine, Lucius)</scenepersonae>
<scenedescription>Aaron hides a bag of gold under a tree. He is met by Tamora, who hopes for a tryst with him, but Aaron is in no mood for love-making, and explains to her that he is plotting Bassianus&#8217;s death. As they embrace, Bassianus and Lavinia come upon them. They mock Tamora soundly for being not only an adulteress, but having the bad taste to choose Aaron for a lover. They are about to leave to inform Saturninus of this, but Aaron has fetched Chiron and Demetrius. Tamora tells them that Bassianus and Lavinia have insulted her and threatened to tie her up and throw her in a pit. The boys stab Bassianus. Tamora is about to kill Lavinia, but the lads asks if they couldn&#8217;t have their way with her first. Despite all of her pleas, Tamora shows Lavinia no mercy, and the lads drag her off after throwing Bassianus&#8217;s body in a pit. Aaron brings in two of Titus&#8217;s sons, Quintus and Martius, having promised them that there is a panther in the pit for them to kill. Martius falls in and is horrified to find Bassianus&#8217;s body. Trying to get his brother out, Quintus falls in as well. Aaron meanwhile has gone to fetch Saturninus and the court, who arrive. The emperor is shocked and confused over his brother&#8217;s death. Tamora brings a false letter purporting to be a plan to kill Bassianus, and Saturninus immediately concludes that Titus&#8217;s two sons are responsible. Titus begs that they be tried, but Saturninus is convinced of their guilt and refuses to let them speak, announcing his intention to have them immediately executed.</scenedescription>

<scenepersonae>(Judges, Senators, Tribunes, Martius, Quintus, Titus, Lucius, Marcus, Lavinia, Aaron the Moor, Messenger)</scenepersonae>
<scenedescription>The Judges and other officials lead Titus&#8217;s sons to execution, paying no attention to his desperate pleading for their lives. He continues begging even after they have left. Lucius enters with his sword drawn; he has just been banished for attempting to free his brothers. He points out to his father that he is merely talking to the stones, but Titus says that it hardly matters who he complains to, as the stone is as likely to pity him as the tribunes. Marcus brings in Lavinia. Lucius is horrified, but Titus berates him for weakness that he will admit it. Titus tries to communicate with her, with small success, but he understands the signs she makes better than the other two. Aaron comes in and tells them that Saturninus has decided that if one of them will chop off one of their hands and send it to the Emperor, he will pardon Quintus and Martius. Lucius, Marcus and Titus immediately begin arguing over which of them should lose a hand, all wanting to be the one. Finally Titus agrees that it won&#8217;t be him, and the other two run off to find an axe; but Titus has only said this to get them out of the way. He gets Aaron to chop off his hand and Aaron takes it away, laughing to himself about this new trick, since there is in fact no offer from Saturninus. The Andronici mourn until a messenger arrives, bringing Titus his hand back and the heads of his sons. This is too much for all of them, and Titus bursts out laughing. He picks up a head, bids Marcus take p the other and Lavinia carry his hand between her teeth as they go home. The exiled Lucius he advises to go to the Goths, there to raise an army to wage war on Rome. Lucius bids them farewell, and promises to himself that he will make Saturninus and Tamora pay.</scenedescription>

Marcus kills a fly, and Titus berates him for cruelty, but when Marcus excuses himself by saying that it was a black fly, like Aaron, Titus joins in pounding on it.

<scenedescription>Yonug Lucius, who is carrying his schoolbooks, is being pursued by Lavinia, who will not leave him be and who is terrifying him. Marcus and Titus stop him, certain that Lavinia is trying to say something. Young Lucius admits that he is afraid she may have gone mad and might hurt him. He begs her pardon and promises to help her however he can, so long as Marcus stays with them. Marcus agrees. Lavinia searches through one of the books Young Lucius has let fall, until she finds the tale of Tereus and Philomel, which parallels what happened to her. They now understand just what has been done to her. Marcus realizes that if she held a long staff between her teeth, she could guide it with the stumps of her arms and trace letters in the sands. She does so, revealing the names of her ravishers. The men and the boy swear to avenge her. Titus decides to send his grandson to Chiron and Demetrius with a warning – a gift of weapons. Marcus prays the gods to help revenge the wrongs done to Titus.</scenedescription>

<scenelocation>Rome. A room in the palace.</scenelocation>
<scenepersonae>(Aaron, Chiron, Demetrius, Young Lucius, Attendant, Nurse, Black Child)</scenepersonae>
<scenedescription>Young Lucius brings Chiron and Demetrius the gift of weapons from Titus, unable to keep from muttering against them to himself. There is also a letter with a verse from Horace. The rather dense lads do not understand the meaning, but Aaron realizes that the gift is a threat. Trumpets ring out: Tamora has given birth. Btu a nurse runs in, carrying the newborn child: it is black, clearly Aaron&#8217;s. Tamora has sent it to him so that he will kill it, but Aaron is quite taken with the baby and refuses to have it killed. Quite shameless about having slept with their mother, he does not let the brothers get anywhere near the child. Having made sure that few people have seen the baby, he then kills the nurse to keep her from talking, and suggests that they sneak a new-born white baby into the palace to take his child&#8217;s place. Having sent Chiron and Demetrius to arrange this, Aaron take his baby and prepares to leave to raise it among the Goths, so as to toughen it up and bring it up as a warrior.</scenedescription>

<scenedescription>Titus and his kinsmen march in, all carrying bows and arrows. Titus is somewhat round the bend, to everyone&#8217;s dismay, asking people to get in touch with the gods. Titus hands out arrows with letters attached to them, one to each god, and tells them to shoot them into the sky; Marcus surreptitiously directs them to shoot them into the Emperor&#8217;s courtyard. A none-too-bright commoner passing by is pressed into service to deliver a knife and a letter to Saturninus.</scenedescription>

<scenedescription>Saturninus complains about the arrows shot at him and their messages, insisting that he has done everything according to the law and that Titus has no justification for his accusations. Tamora calms him down, who is delighted that she has clearly managed to drive Titus mad. The commoner arrives with his message; Saturninus reads it and promptly has the messenger hanged. Ranting, Saturninus orders that Titus be brought to him, swearing to kill him. Aemilius runs in to call on the Romans to arm themselves: the Goths are coming, and they are being led by Lucius. Saturninus is immediately discouraged, as he knows that the people of Rome love Lucius far more than they do him. He fears rebellion. Tamora stiffens his spine while promising to appease Titus. She sends Aemilius to arrange for a parley with the Goth leaders, to be held at Titus&#8217;s house. Her intent is to use Titus to get Lucius to leave the Goths.</scenedescription>

<scenepersonae>(Lucius, Goths, Aaron the Moor, Aemilius)</scenepersonae>
<scenedescription>Lucius rallies his Goths, telling them that he has received news from Rome confirming that the people hate Saturninus and will welcome the Goths&#8217; invasion. A Goth brings in Aaron, who is carrying his child. Recognizing him, Lucius orders him to be immediately hanged, along with the baby. Aaron tells him not to hurt the child, but this merely makes Lucius decide to kill it first, since this will hurt Aaron more. Aaron promises to tell Lucius useful things if he spares the baby, and Lucius orders him to speak. Aaron makes a general, boasting confession of all his crimes, and Lucius spares him from hanging because that death would be too easy. Aemilius brings the invitation to parley at Titus&#8217;s.</scenedescription>

<line form="verse">Approved warriors, and my faithful friends,</line>
<line form="verse">I have received letters from great Rome</line>
<line form="verse">Which signifies what hate they bear their emperor,</line>

<line form="verse">Therefore, great lords, be as your titles witness,</line>

<line form="verse">Renowmed Lucius, from our troops I stray&#8217;d</line>
<line form="verse">To gaze upon a ruinous monastery,</line>
<line form="verse">And as I earnestly did fix mine eye</line>
<line form="verse">Upon the wasted building, suddenly</line>
<line form="verse">I heard a child cry underneath a wall.</line>
<line form="verse">I made unto the noise, when soon I heard</line>
<line form="verse">The crying babe controll&#8217;d with this discourse:</line>
<line form="verse">&#8220;Peace, tawny slave, half me and half thy dame.</line>
<line form="verse">Did not thy hue bewray whose brat thou art,</line>
<line form="verse">Had nature lent thee but thy mother&#8217;s look,</line>
<line form="verse">Villain, thou mightst have been an emperor.</line>
<line form="verse">But where the bull and cow are both milk-white,</line>
<line form="verse">They never do beget a coal-black calf.</line>
<line form="verse">Peace, villain, peace!&#8221;&#8212;even thus he rates the babe&#8212;</line>
<line form="verse">&#8220;For I must bear thee to a trusty Goth,</line>
<line form="verse">Who, when he knows thou art the Empress&#8217; babe,</line>
<line form="verse">Will hold thee dearly for thy mother&#8217;s sake.&#8221;</line>
<line form="verse">With this, my weapon drawn, I rush&#8217;d upon him,</line>
<line form="verse">Surpris&#8217;d him suddenly, and brought him hither</line>
<line form="verse">To use as you think needful of the man.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LUC.</speaker>
<line form="verse">O worthy Goth, this is the incarnate devil</line>
<line form="verse">That robb&#8217;d Andronicus of his good hand;</line>
<line form="verse">This is the pearl that pleas&#8217;d your empress&#8217; eye,</line>
<line form="verse">And here&#8217;s the base fruit of her burning lust.</line>
<line form="verse">Say, wall-ey&#8217;d slave, whither wouldst thou convey</line>
<line form="verse">This growing image of thy fiend-like face?</line>
<line form="verse">Why dost not speak? What, deaf? Not a word?</line>
<line form="verse">A halter, soldiers! Hang him on this tree,</line>
<line form="verse">And by his side his fruit of bastardy.</line>

<speaker>AAR.</speaker>

<speech>
<speaker>LUC.</speaker>
<line form="verse">Too like the sire forever being good.</line>

<line form="verse">And if it please thee? Why, assure thee, Lucius,</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>AAR.</speaker>
<line form="verse">What if I do not? As indeed I do not,</line>
<line form="verse">Yet for I know thou art religious,</line>
<line form="verse">And hast a thing within thee called conscience,</line>
<line form="verse">With twenty popish tricks and ceremonies,</line>
<line form="verse">Which I have seen thee careful to observe,</line>
<line form="verse">Therefore I urge thy oath; for that I know</line>
<line form="verse">An idiot holds his bauble for a god,</line>
<line form="verse">And keeps the oath which by that god he swears,</line>
<line form="verse">To that I&#8217;ll urge him: therefore thou shalt vow</line>
<line form="verse">By that same god, what god soe&#8217;er it be</line>
<line form="verse">That thou adorest and hast in reverence,</line>
<line form="verse">To save my boy, to nourish and bring him up,</line>

<line form="verse">O most insatiate and luxurious woman!</line>

<speech>
<speaker>AAR.</speaker>
<line form="verse">Tut, Lucius, this was but a deed of charity</line>
<line form="verse">To that which thou shalt hear of me anon.</line>
<line form="verse">&#8217;Twas her two sons that murdered Bassianus;</line>
<line form="verse">They cut thy sister&#8217;s tongue, and ravish&#8217;d her,</line>
<line form="verse">And cut her hands, and trimm&#8217;d her as thou sawest.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>LUC.</speaker>
<line form="verse">O detestable villain, call&#8217;st thou that trimming?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>AAR.</speaker>
<line form="verse">Why, she was wash&#8217;d, and cut, and trimm&#8217;d, and &#8217;twas</line>
<line form="verse">Trim sport for them which had the doing of it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LUC.</speaker>
<line form="verse">O barbarous, beastly villains like thyself!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>AAR.</speaker>
<line form="verse">Indeed I was their tutor to instruct them.</line>
<line form="verse">That codding spirit had they from their mother,</line>
<line form="verse">As sure a card as ever won the set;</line>
<line form="verse">That bloody mind I think they learn&#8217;d of me,</line>
<line form="verse">As true a dog as ever fought at head.</line>
<line form="verse">Well, let my deeds be witness of my worth:</line>
<line form="verse">I train&#8217;d thy brethren to that guileful hole,</line>
<line form="verse">Where the dead corpse of Bassianus lay;</line>
<line form="verse">I wrote the letter that thy father found,</line>
<line form="verse">And hid the gold within that letter mentioned,</line>
<line form="verse">Confederate with the Queen and her two sons;</line>
<line form="verse">And what not done, that thou hast cause to rue,</line>
<line form="verse">Wherein I had no stroke of mischief in it?</line>
<line form="verse">I play&#8217;d the cheater for thy father&#8217;s hand,</line>
<line form="verse">And when I had it, drew myself apart,</line>
<line form="verse">And almost broke my heart with extreme laughter.</line>
<line form="verse">I pried me through the crevice of a wall,</line>
<line form="verse">When, for his hand, he had his two sons&#8217; heads,</line>
<line form="verse">Beheld his tears, and laugh&#8217;d so heartily</line>
<line form="verse">That both mine eyes were rainy like to his;</line>
<line form="verse">And when I told the Empress of this sport,</line>
<line form="verse">She sounded almost at my pleasing tale,</line>
<line form="verse">And for my tidings gave me twenty kisses.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. GOTH.</speaker>
<line form="verse">What, canst thou say all this and never blush?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>AAR.</speaker>
<line form="verse">Ay, like a black dog, as the saying is.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LUC.</speaker>
<line form="verse">Are thou not sorry for these heinous deeds?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>AAR.</speaker>
<line form="verse">Ay, that I had not done a thousand more.</line>
<line form="verse">Even now I curse the day&#8212;and yet I think</line>
<line form="verse">Few come within the compass of my curse&#8212;</line>
<line form="verse">Wherein I did not some notorious ill:</line>
<line form="verse">As kill a man, or else devise his death,</line>
<line form="verse">Ravish a maid, or plot the way to do it,</line>
<line form="verse">Accuse some innocent, and forswear myself,</line>
<line form="verse">Set deadly enmity between two friends,</line>
<line form="verse">Make poor men&#8217;s cattle break their necks,</line>
<line form="verse">Set fire on barns and haystalks in the night,</line>
<line form="verse">And bid the owners quench them with their tears.</line>
<line form="verse">Oft have I digg&#8217;d up dead men from their graves,</line>
<line form="verse">And set them upright at their dear friends&#8217; door,</line>
<line form="verse">Even when their sorrows almost was forgot,</line>
<line form="verse">And on their skins, as on the bark of trees,</line>
<line form="verse">Have with my knife carved in Roman letters,</line>
<line form="verse">&#8220;Let not your sorrow die, though I am dead.&#8221;</line>
<line form="verse">But I have done a thousand dreadful things,</line>
<line form="verse">As willingly as one would kill a fly,</line>
<line form="verse">And nothing grieves me heartily indeed,</line>
<line form="verse">But that I cannot do ten thousand more.</line>

<scenelocation>Rome. Before Titus&#8217; house.</scenelocation>
<scenepersonae>(Tamora, Demetrius, Chiron, Titus, Marcus, Publius, Caius, Valentine, Lavinia)</scenepersonae>
<scenedescription>Tamora and her sons have disguised themselves as the personifications of Revenge, Rape, and Murder. They visit Titus, hoping to play on his madness to get him to help get Lucius away from the Goths. He recognizes them, but they convince him that this is a mere resemblance. Or at least they think they convince him. He is much less mad than they think, and his speech is laden with double meanings that threaten them. Tamora tells him to invite Lucius to a feast, and he sends Marcus to arrange this. As she is about to leave Titus requests that she leave Rape and Murder with him, and to humor him she agrees. As soon as Tamora is gone Titus has the lads seized, bound and gagged. Titus comes back to them with Lavinia, and informs them what he is going to do: having killed them, he will grind their bones and mix it with their blood to make pies which he will fill with their heads and feed to Tamora at the parley feast. He slits their throats as Lavinia holds a basin to collect the blood.</scenedescription>

<scenelocation>Court of Titus’s house.</scenelocation>
<scenepersonae>(Lucius, Marcus, Goths, Aaron, Attendants, Emperor Saturninus, Empress, Aemilius, Tribunes, Senators, Titus, Lavinia)</scenepersonae>
<scenedescription>Lucius places his men in ambush, in case Saturninus has made plans against them, and bids them have Aaron nearby so that it will be easy to confront Tamora with him. Saturninus arrives and is shocked that Lucius does not bow. Marcus asks everyone to calm down and sit for the meal. Titus, dressed as a cook, brings in the food. Lavinia is also present, veiled. Titus asks Saturninus&#8217;s advice on something: is it right for a father to kill a daughter who has been raped? Saturninus agrees that it&#8217;s quite the right thing to do, and Titus accordingly kills Lavinia. Saturninus is shocked and asks why he has done this; Titus explains, all the while encouraging Tamora to eat. Saturninus wants to know who harmed Lavinia, and when Titus names Chiron and Demetrius the Emperor has them sent for. Titus now reveals that they are in the pies that Tamora has been eating, and then stabs the Empress. Saturninus immediately kills Titus, and Lucius kills him for it. After an uproar, Marcus and Aemilius try to calm things down. Aemilius asks for an explanation; Lucius and Marcus recount all the wrongs done by Saturninus, Tamora, Chiron and Demetrius. Marcus offers to die for Rome if Rome wants it so abut Aemilius instead acclaims Lucius as the new Emperor. Marcus calls for Aaron to be brought in to punishment. While waiting for him, the remaining Andronici – Lucius, Marcus, and Young Lucius – mourn their dead patriarch. When he is brought in, Lucius orders that Aaron be buried up to the chest and starved to death. Saturninus he has buried with his family; Titus and Lavinia in the Andronicus fault; and Tamora&#8217;s body he has thrown to the wolves.</scenedescription>
