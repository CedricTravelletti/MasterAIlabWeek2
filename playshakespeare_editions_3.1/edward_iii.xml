<SCENE>
<SCENETITLE>Scene 1</SCENETITLE>
<SCENELOCATION>London. A Room of State in the Palace. Flourish.</SCENELOCATION>
<SCENEPERSONAE>(King Edward, Derby, Prince Edward, Audley, Artois, Lords, Lorraine, Mountague)</SCENEPERSONAE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter King Edward, Derby, Prince Edward, Audley, and Artois.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Robert of Artois, banished though thou be</LINE>
<LINE>From France, thy native Country, yet with us</LINE>
<LINE>Thou shalt retain as great a Seigniorie:</LINE>
<LINE>For we create thee Earl of Richmond here.</LINE>
<LINE>And now go forwards with our pedigree:</LINE>
<LINE>Who next succeeded Phillip le Bew?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARTOIS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Three sons of his, which all successfully</LINE>
<LINE>Did sit upon their father&#8217;s regal throne,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet died, and left no issue of their loins.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But was my mother sister unto those?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARTOIS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She was, my lord; and only Isabel</LINE>
<LINE>Was all the daughters that this Phillip had,</LINE>
<LINE>Whom afterward your father took to wife;</LINE>
<LINE>And from the fragrant garden of her womb</LINE>
<LINE>Your gracious self, the flower of Europe&#8217;s hope,</LINE>
<LINE>Derived is inheritor to France.</LINE>
<LINE>But note the rancor of rebellious minds:</LINE>
<LINE>When thus the lineage of le Bew was out,</LINE>
<LINE>The French obscured your mother&#8217;s privilege,</LINE>
<LINE>And, though she were the next of blood, proclaimed</LINE>
<LINE>John, of the house of Valois, now their king:</LINE>
<LINE>The reason was, they say, the realm of France,</LINE>
<LINE>Replete with princes of great parentage,</LINE>
<LINE>Ought not admit a governor to rule,</LINE>
<LINE>Except he be descended of the male;</LINE>
<LINE>And that&#8217;s the special ground of their contempt,</LINE>
<LINE>Wherewith they study to exclude your grace:</LINE>
<LINE>But they shall find that forged ground of theirs</LINE>
<LINE>To be but dusty heaps of brittle sand.</LINE>
<LINE>Perhaps it will be thought a heinous thing,</LINE>
<LINE>That I, a Frenchman, should discover this;</LINE>
<LINE>But heaven I call to record of my vows:</LINE>
<LINE>It is not hate nor any private wrong,</LINE>
<LINE>But love unto my country and the right,</LINE>
<LINE>Provokes my tongue, thus lavish in report.</LINE>
<LINE>You are the lineal watchman of our peace,</LINE>
<LINE>And John of Valois indirectly climbs;</LINE>
<LINE>What then should subjects but embrace their King?</LINE>
<LINE>Ah, where in may our duty more be seen,</LINE>
<LINE>Than striving to rebate a tyrant&#8217;s pride</LINE>
<LINE>And place the true shepherd of our commonwealth?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This counsel, Artois, like to fruitful showers,</LINE>
<LINE>Hath added growth unto my dignity;</LINE>
<LINE>And, by the fiery vigor of thy words,</LINE>
<LINE>Hot courage is engendered in my breast,</LINE>
<LINE>Which heretofore was raked in ignorance,</LINE>
<LINE>But now doth mount with golden wings of fame,</LINE>
<LINE>And will approve fair Isabel&#8217;s descent,</LINE>
<LINE>Able to yoke their stubborn necks with steel,</LINE>
<LINE>That spurn against my sovereignty in France.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Sound a horn.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>A messenger?&#8212;Lord Audley, know from whence.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit Audley, and returns.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUDLEY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The Duke of Lorraine, having crossed the seas,</LINE>
<LINE>Entreats he may have conference with your highness.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Admit him, lords, that we may hear the news.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exeunt lords. King takes his State. Re-enter lords; with Lorraine, attended.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Say, Duke of Lorraine, wherefore art thou come?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORRAIN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The most renowned prince, King John of France,</LINE>
<LINE>Doth greet thee, Edward, and by me commands,</LINE>
<LINE>That, for so much as by his liberal gift</LINE>
<LINE>The Guyen Dukedom is entailed to thee,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou do him lowly homage for the same.</LINE>
<LINE>And, for that purpose, here I summon thee,</LINE>
<LINE>Repair to France within these forty days,</LINE>
<LINE>That there, according as the custom is,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou mayst be sworn true liegeman to our King;</LINE>
<LINE>Or else thy title in that province dies,</LINE>
<LINE>And he himself will repossess the place.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>See, how occasion laughs me in the face!</LINE>
<LINE>No sooner minded to prepare for France,</LINE>
<LINE>But straight I am invited,&#8212;nay, with threats,</LINE>
<LINE>Upon a penalty, enjoined to come:</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Twere but a childish part to say him nay.&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Lorraine, return this answer to thy lord:</LINE>
<LINE>I mean to visit him as he requests;</LINE>
<LINE>But how? Not servilely disposed to bend,</LINE>
<LINE>But like a conqueror to make him bow.</LINE>
<LINE>His lame unpolished shifts are come to light;</LINE>
<LINE>And truth hath pulled the vizard from his face,</LINE>
<LINE>That set a gloss upon his arrogance.</LINE>
<LINE>Dare he command a fealty in me?</LINE>
<LINE>Tell him, the Crown that he usurps, is mine,</LINE>
<LINE>And where he sets his foot, he ought to kneel.</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis not a petty dukedom that I claim,</LINE>
<LINE>But all the whole dominions of the realm;</LINE>
<LINE>Which if with grudging he refuse to yield,</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll take away those borrowed plumes of his,</LINE>
<LINE>And send him naked to the wilderness.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORRAIN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then, Edward, here, in spite of all thy lords,</LINE>
<LINE>I do pronounce defiance to thy face.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Defiance, Frenchman? We rebound it back,</LINE>
<LINE>Even to the bottom of thy master&#8217;s throat.</LINE>
<LINE>And, be it spoke with reverence of the king,</LINE>
<LINE>My gracious father, and these other lords,</LINE>
<LINE>I hold thy message but as scurrilous,</LINE>
<LINE>And him that sent thee, like the lazy drone,</LINE>
<LINE>Crept up by stealth unto the eagle&#8217;s nest;</LINE>
<LINE>From whence we&#8217;ll shake him with so rough a storm,</LINE>
<LINE>As others shall be warned by his harm.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WARWICK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Bid him leave of the lion&#8217;s case he wears,</LINE>
<LINE>Least, meeting with the lion in the field,</LINE>
<LINE>He chance to tear him piecemeal for his pride.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARTOIS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The soundest counsel I can give his grace,</LINE>
<LINE>Is to surrender ere he be constrained.</LINE>
<LINE>A voluntary mischief hath less scorn,</LINE>
<LINE>Than when reproach with violence is borne.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORRAIN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Degenerate traitor, viper to the place</LINE>
<LINE>Where thou was fostered in thine infancy,</LINE>
<LINE>Bearest thou a part in this conspiracy?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>He draws his sword.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Lorraine, behold the sharpness of this steel:</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Drawing his.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Fervent desire that sits against my heart,</LINE>
<LINE>Is far more thorny pricking than this blade;</LINE>
<LINE>That, with the nightingale, I shall be scared,</LINE>
<LINE>As oft as I dispose myself to rest,</LINE>
<LINE>Until my colours be displayed in France:</LINE>
<LINE>This is my final answer; so be gone.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORRAIN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is not that, nor any English brave,</LINE>
<LINE>Afflicts me so, as doth his poisoned view,</LINE>
<LINE>That is most false, should most of all be true.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt Lorraine, and Train.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, lord, our fleeting bark is under sail;</LINE>
<LINE>Our gage is thrown, and war is soon begun,</LINE>
<LINE>But not so quickly brought unto an end.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter Mountague.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>But wherefore comes Sir William Mountague?</LINE>
<LINE>How stands the league between the Scot and us?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MOUNTAGUE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Cracked and dissevered, my renowned lord.</LINE>
<LINE>The treacherous King no sooner was informed</LINE>
<LINE>Of your with drawing of your army back,</LINE>
<LINE>But straight, forgetting of his former oath,</LINE>
<LINE>He made invasion on the bordering Towns:</LINE>
<LINE>Barwick is won, Newcastle spoiled and lost,</LINE>
<LINE>And now the tyrant hath begirt with siege</LINE>
<LINE>The castle of Rocksborough, where enclos&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>The Countess Salisbury is like to perish. </LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That is thy daughter, Warwick, is it not?</LINE>
<LINE>Whose husband hath in Britain served so long</LINE>
<LINE>About the planting of Lord Mountford there?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WARWICK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ignoble David, hast thou none to grieve</LINE>
<LINE>But silly Ladies with thy threatening arms?</LINE>
<LINE>But I will make you shrink your snaily horns!</LINE>
<LINE>First, therefore, Audley, this shall be thy charge,</LINE>
<LINE>Go levy footmen for our wars in France;</LINE>
<LINE>And, Ned, take muster of our men at arms:</LINE>
<LINE>In every shire elect a several band.</LINE>
<LINE>Let them be Soldiers of a lusty spirit,</LINE>
<LINE>Such as dread nothing but dishonor&#8217;s blot;</LINE>
<LINE>Be wary, therefore, since we do commence</LINE>
<LINE>A famous war, and with so mighty a nation.</LINE>
<LINE>Derby, be thou ambassador for us</LINE>
<LINE>Unto our father in law, the Earl of Henalt:</LINE>
<LINE>Make him acquainted with our enterprise,</LINE>
<LINE>And likewise will him, with our own allies</LINE>
<LINE>That are in Flanders, to solicit to</LINE>
<LINE>The Emperor of Almaigne in our name.</LINE>
<LINE>Myself, whilst you are jointly thus employed,</LINE>
<LINE>Will, with these forces that I have at hand,</LINE>
<LINE>March, and once more repulse the traitorous Scot.</LINE>
<LINE>But, Sirs, be resolute: we shall have wars</LINE>
<LINE>On every side; and, Ned, thou must begin</LINE>
<LINE>Now to forget thy study and thy books,</LINE>
<LINE>And ure thy shoulders to an armor&#8217;s weight.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As cheerful sounding to my youthful spleen</LINE>
<LINE>This tumult is of war&#8217;s increasing broils,</LINE>
<LINE>As, at the coronation of a king,</LINE>
<LINE>The joyful clamours of the people are,</LINE>
<LINE>When &#8220;Ave, Caesar!&#8221; they pronounce aloud.</LINE>
<LINE>Within this school of honor I shall learn</LINE>
<LINE>Either to sacrifice my foes to death,</LINE>
<LINE>Or in a rightful quarrel spend my breath.</LINE>
<LINE>Then cheerfully forward, each a several way;</LINE>
<LINE>In great affairs &#8217;tis nought to use delay.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt.</STAGEDIR>

<SCENEPERSONAE>(Countess of Salisbury, David, Douglas, Lorraine, First Scottish Messenger, Second Scottish Messenger, King Edward, Warwick, Artois)</SCENEPERSONAE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter the Countess.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alas, how much in vain my poor eyes gaze</LINE>
<LINE>For succour that my sovereign should send!</LINE>
<LINE>Ah, cousin Mountague, I fear thou wants</LINE>
<LINE>The lively spirit, sharply to solicit</LINE>
<LINE>With vehement suit the king in my behalf:</LINE>
<LINE>Thou dost not tell him, what a grief it is</LINE>
<LINE>To be the scornful captive of a Scot,</LINE>
<LINE>Either to be wooed with broad untuned oaths,</LINE>
<LINE>Or forced by rough insulting barbarism;</LINE>
<LINE>Thou doest not tell him, if he here prevail,</LINE>
<LINE>How much they will deride us in the north,</LINE>
<LINE>And, in their wild, uncivil, skipping gigs,</LINE>
<LINE>Bray forth their conquest and our overthrow</LINE>
<LINE>Even in the barren, bleak, and fruitless air.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter David and Douglas, Lorraine.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>I must withdraw, the everlasting foe</LINE>
<LINE>Comes to the wall; I&#8217;ll closely step aside,</LINE>
<LINE>And list their babble, blunt and full of pride.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING DAVID.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord of Lorraine, to our brother of France</LINE>
<LINE>Commend us, as the man in Christendom</LINE>
<LINE>That we most reverence and entirely love.</LINE>
<LINE>Touching your embassage, return and say,</LINE>
<LINE>That we with England will not enter parley,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor never make fair weather, or take truce;</LINE>
<LINE>But burn their neighbor towns, and so persist</LINE>
<LINE>With eager roads beyond their city York.</LINE>
<LINE>And never shall our bonny riders rest,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor rusting canker have the time to eat</LINE>
<LINE>Their light borne snaffles nor their nimble spurs,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor lay aside their Jacks of Gymould mayle,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor hang their staves of grained Scottish ash</LINE>
<LINE>In peaceful wise upon their city walls,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor from their buttoned tawny leathern belts</LINE>
<LINE>Dismiss their biting whinyards, till your King</LINE>
<LINE>Cry out, &#8220;Enough! Spare England now for pity!&#8221;</LINE>
<LINE>Farewell, and tell him that you leave us here</LINE>
<LINE>Before this castle; say, you came from us,</LINE>
<LINE>Even when we had that yielded to our hands.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORRAIN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I take my leave, and fairly will return</LINE>
<LINE>Your acceptable greeting to my king.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit Lorraine.</STAGEDIR>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING DAVID.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, Douglas, to our former task again,</LINE>
<LINE>For the division of this certain spoil.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOUGLAS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My liege, I crave the lady, and no more.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING DAVID.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, soft ye, sir; first I must make my choice,</LINE>
<LINE>And first I do bespeak her for myself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOUGLAS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why then, my liege, let me enjoy her jewels.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING DAVID.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Those are her own, still liable to her,</LINE>
<LINE>And who inherits her, hath those with all.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter First Scottish Messenger in haste.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. SCOT. MESS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My liege, as we were pricking on the hills,</LINE>
<LINE>To fetch in booty, marching hitherward,</LINE>
<LINE>We might descry a might host of men;</LINE>
<LINE>The sun, reflecting on the armour, shewed</LINE>
<LINE>A field of plate, a wood of picks advanced.</LINE>
<LINE>Bethink your highness speedily herein:</LINE>
<LINE>An easy march within four hours will bring</LINE>
<LINE>The hindmost rank unto this place, my liege.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING DAVID.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Dislodge, dislodge! It is the king of England.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOUGLAS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Jemmy, my man, saddle my bonny black.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING DAVID.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Meanst thou to fight, Douglas? We are too weak.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOUGLAS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know it well, my liege, and therefore fly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS.</SPEAKER>
<STAGEDIR>Coming forward.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>My lords of Scotland, will ye stay and drink?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING DAVID.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She mocks at us, Douglas; I cannot endure it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Say, good my lord, which is he must have the Lady,</LINE>
<LINE>And which her jewels? I am sure, my lords,</LINE>
<LINE>Ye will not hence, till you have shared the spoils.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING DAVID.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She heard the messenger, and heard our talk;</LINE>
<LINE>And now that comfort makes her scorn at us.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Second Scottish Messenger.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. SCOT. MESS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Arm, my good lord! O, we are all surprised!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>After the French ambassador, my liege,</LINE>
<LINE>And tell him, that you dare not ride to York;</LINE>
<LINE>Excuse it that your bonny horse is lame.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING DAVID.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She heard that too; intolerable grief!</LINE>
<LINE>Woman, farewell! Although I do not stay...</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exeunt Scots.</STAGEDIR>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis not for fear, and yet you run away.&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>O happy comfort, welcome to our house!</LINE>
<LINE>The confident and boisterous boasting Scot,</LINE>
<LINE>That swore before my walls they would not back</LINE>
<LINE>For all the armed power of this land,</LINE>
<LINE>With faceless fear that ever turns his back,</LINE>
<LINE>Turned hence against the blasting north-east wind</LINE>
<LINE>Upon the bare report and name of arms.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter Mountague.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>O Summer&#8217;s day! See where my Cousin comes!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MOUNTAGUE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How fares my Aunt? We are not Scots;</LINE>
<LINE>Why do you shut your gates against your friends?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well may I give a welcome, cousin, to thee,</LINE>
<LINE>For thou comst well to chase my foes from hence.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MOUNTAGUE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The king himself is come in person hither;</LINE>
<LINE>Dear aunt, descend, and gratulate his highness.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How may I entertain his majesty,</LINE>
<LINE>To shew my duty and his dignity?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit, from above.</STAGEDIR>

<STAGEDIR>Enter King Edward, Warwick, Artois, with others.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, are the stealing Foxes fled and gone,</LINE>
<LINE>Before we could uncouple at their heels?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WARWICK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>They are, my liege; but, with a cheerful cry,</LINE>
<LINE>Hot hounds and hardy chase them at the heels.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Countess.</STAGEDIR>
<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This is the countess, Warwick, is it not?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WARWICK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Even she, my liege; whose beauty tyrants fear,</LINE>
<LINE>As a May blossom with pernicious winds,</LINE>
<LINE>Hath sullied, withered, overcast, and done.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hath she been fairer, Warwick, than she is?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WARWICK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My gracious King, fair is she not at all,</LINE>
<LINE>If that herself were by to stain herself,</LINE>
<LINE>As I have scene her when she was herself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What strange enchantment lurked in those her eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>When they excelled this excellence they have,</LINE>
<LINE>That now her dim decline hath power to draw</LINE>
<LINE>My subject eyes from persing majesty,</LINE>
<LINE>To gaze on her with doting admiration?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In duty lower than the ground I kneel,</LINE>
<LINE>And for my dull knees bow my feeling heart,</LINE>
<LINE>To witness my obedience to your highness,</LINE>
<LINE>With many millions of a subject&#8217;s thanks</LINE>
<LINE>For this your royal presence, whose approach</LINE>
<LINE>Hath driven war and danger from my gate.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Lady, stand up; I come to bring thee peace,</LINE>
<LINE>How ever thereby I have purchased war.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No war to you, my liege; the Scots are gone,</LINE>
<LINE>And gallop home toward Scotland with their hate.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Least, yielding here, I pine in shameful love,</LINE>
<LINE>Come, we&#8217;ll pursue the Scots;&#8212;Artois, away!</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A little while, my gracious sovereign, stay,</LINE>
<LINE>And let the power of a mighty king</LINE>
<LINE>Honor our roof; my husband in the wars,</LINE>
<LINE>When he shall hear it, will triumph for joy;</LINE>
<LINE>Then, dear my liege, now niggard not thy state:</LINE>
<LINE>Being at the wall, enter our homely gate.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pardon me, countess, I will come no near;</LINE>
<LINE>I dreamed tonight of treason, and I fear.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Far from this place let ugly treason lie!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No farther off, than her conspiring eye,</LINE>
<LINE>Which shoots infected poison in my heart,</LINE>
<LINE>Beyond repulse of wit or cure of art.</LINE>
<LINE>Now, in the sun alone it doth not lie,</LINE>
<LINE>With light to take light from a mortal eye;</LINE>
<LINE>For here two day stars that mine eyes would see</LINE>
<LINE>More than the sun steals mine own light from me,</LINE>
<LINE>Contemplative desire, desire to be</LINE>
<LINE>In contemplation, that may master thee!</LINE>
<LINE>Warwick, Artois, to horse and let&#8217;s away!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What might I speak to make my sovereign stay?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What needs a tongue to such a speaking eye,</LINE>
<LINE>That more persuades than winning Oratory?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let not thy presence, like the April sun,</LINE>
<LINE>Flatter our earth and suddenly be done.</LINE>
<LINE>More happy do not make our outward wall</LINE>
<LINE>Than thou wilt grace our inner house withal.</LINE>
<LINE>Our house, my liege, is like a country swain,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose habit rude and manners blunt and plain</LINE>
<LINE>Presageth nought, yet inly beautified</LINE>
<LINE>With bounties, riches and faire hidden pride.</LINE>
<LINE>For where the golden ore doth buried lie,</LINE>
<LINE>The ground, undecked with nature&#8217;s tapestry,</LINE>
<LINE>Seems barren, sere, unfertile, fructless, dry;</LINE>
<LINE>And where the upper turf of earth doth boast</LINE>
<LINE>His pied perfumes and party coloured coat,</LINE>
<LINE>Delve there, and find this issue and their pride</LINE>
<LINE>To spring from ordure and corruption&#8217;s side.</LINE>
<LINE>But, to make up my all too long compare,</LINE>
<LINE>These ragged walls no testimony are,</LINE>
<LINE>What is within; but, like a cloak, doth hide</LINE>
<LINE>From weather&#8217;s Waste the under garnished pride.</LINE>
<LINE>More gracious then my terms can let thee be,</LINE>
<LINE>Intreat thyself to stay a while with me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As wise, as fair; what fond fit can be heard,</LINE>
<LINE>When wisdom keeps the gate as beauty&#8217;s guard?&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>It shall attend, while I attend on thee:</LINE>
<LINE>Come on, my lords; here will I host tonight.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Lodowick.</STAGEDIR>
 
<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LODOWICK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I might perceive his eye in her eye lost,</LINE>
<LINE>His ear to drink her sweet tongue&#8217;s utterance,</LINE>
<LINE>And changing passion, like inconstant clouds</LINE>
<LINE>That rack upon the carriage of the winds,</LINE>
<LINE>Increase and die in his disturbed cheeks.</LINE>
<LINE>Lo, when she blushed, even then did he look pale,</LINE>
<LINE>As if her cheeks by some enchanted power</LINE>
<LINE>Attracted had the cherry blood from his:</LINE>
<LINE>Anon, with reverent fear when she grew pale,</LINE>
<LINE>His cheeks put on their scarlet ornaments;</LINE>
<LINE>But no more like her oriental red,</LINE>
<LINE>Than brick to coral or live things to dead.</LINE>
<LINE>Why did he then thus counterfeit her looks?</LINE>
<LINE>If she did blush, twas tender modest shame,</LINE>
<LINE>Being in the sacred presence of a King;</LINE>
<LINE>If he did blush, twas red immodest shame,</LINE>
<LINE>To veil his eyes amiss, being a king;</LINE>
<LINE>If she looked pale, twas silly woman&#8217;s fear,</LINE>
<LINE>To bear herself in presence of a king;</LINE>
<LINE>If he looked pale, it was with guilty fear,</LINE>
<LINE>To dote amiss, being a mighty king.</LINE>
<LINE>Then, Scottish wars, farewell; I fear twill prove</LINE>
<LINE>A lingering English siege of peevish love.</LINE>
<LINE>Here comes his highness, walking all alone.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter King Edward.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She is grown more fairer far since I came hither,</LINE>
<LINE>Her voice more silver every word than other,</LINE>
<LINE>Her wit more fluent. What a strange discourse</LINE>
<LINE>Unfolded she of David and his Scots!</LINE>
<LINE>&#8220;Even thus,&#8221; quoth she, &#8220;he spake,&#8221; and then spoke broad,</LINE>
<LINE>With epithites and accents of the Scot,</LINE>
<LINE>But somewhat better than the Scot could speak:</LINE>
<LINE>&#8220;And thus,&#8221; quoth she, and answered then herself&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>For who could speak like her but she herself&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Breathes from the wall an angel&#8217;s note from heaven</LINE>
<LINE>Of sweet defiance to her barbarous foes.</LINE>
<LINE>When she would talk of peace, me thinks, her tongue</LINE>
<LINE>Commanded war to prison; when of war,</LINE>
<LINE>It wakened Caesar from his Roman grave,</LINE>
<LINE>To hear war beautified by her discourse.</LINE>
<LINE>Wisdom is foolishness but in her tongue,</LINE>
<LINE>Beauty a slander but in her fair face,</LINE>
<LINE>There is no summer but in her cheerful looks,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor frosty winter but in her disdain.</LINE>
<LINE>I cannot blame the Scots that did besiege her,</LINE>
<LINE>For she is all the treasure of our land;</LINE>
<LINE>But call them cowards, that they ran away,</LINE>
<LINE>Having so rich and fair a cause to stay.&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Art thou there, Lodowick? Give me ink and paper.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LODOWICK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will, my liege.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And bid the lords hold on their play at chess,</LINE>
<LINE>For we will walk and meditate alone.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LODOWICK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will, my sovereign.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit Lodowick.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This fellow is well read in poetry,</LINE>
<LINE>And hath a lusty and persuasive spirit;</LINE>
<LINE>I will acquaint him with my passion,</LINE>
<LINE>Which he shall shadow with a veil of lawn,</LINE>
<LINE>Through which the queen of beauties queen shall see</LINE>
<LINE>Her self the ground of my infirmity.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Lodowick.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hast thou pen, ink, and paper ready, Lodowick?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LODOWICK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ready, my liege.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then in the summer arbor sit by me,</LINE>
<LINE>Make it our counsel house or cabinet:</LINE>
<LINE>Since green our thoughts, green be the conventicle,</LINE>
<LINE>Where we will ease us by disburdening them.</LINE>
<LINE>Now, Lodowick, invocate some golden muse,</LINE>
<LINE>To bring thee hither an enchanted pen,</LINE>
<LINE>That may for sighs set down true sighs indeed,</LINE>
<LINE>Talking of grief, to make thee ready groan; </LINE>
<LINE>And when thou writest of tears, encouch the word</LINE>
<LINE>Before and after with such sweet laments,</LINE>
<LINE>That it may raise drops in a Tartar&#8217;s eye,</LINE>
<LINE>And make a flintheart Scythian pitiful;</LINE>
<LINE>For so much moving hath a Poet&#8217;s pen:</LINE>
<LINE>Then, if thou be a poet, move thou so,</LINE>
<LINE>And be enriched by thy sovereign&#8217;s love.</LINE>
<LINE>For, if the touch of sweet concordant strings</LINE>
<LINE>Could force attendance in the ears of hell,</LINE>
<LINE>How much more shall the strains of poets&#8217; wit</LINE>
<LINE>Beguile and ravish soft and humane minds?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LODOWICK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To whom, my lord, shall I direct my stile?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To one that shames the fair and sots the wise;</LINE>
<LINE>Whose bod is an abstract or a brief,</LINE>
<LINE>Contains each general virtue in the world.</LINE>
<LINE>Better than beautiful thou must begin,</LINE>
<LINE>Devise for fair a fairer word than fair,</LINE>
<LINE>And every ornament that thou wouldest praise,</LINE>
<LINE>Fly it a pitch above the soar of praise.</LINE>
<LINE>For flattery fear thou not to be convicted;</LINE>
<LINE>For, were thy admiration ten times more,</LINE>
<LINE>Ten times ten thousand more the worth exceeds</LINE>
<LINE>Of that thou art to praise, thy praises worth.</LINE>
<LINE>Begin; I will to contemplate the while:</LINE>
<LINE>Forget not to set down, how passionate,</LINE>
<LINE>How heart sick, and how full of languishment,</LINE>
<LINE>Her beauty makes me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LODOWICK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Write I to a woman?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What beauty else could triumph over me,</LINE>
<LINE>Or who but women do our love lays greet?</LINE>
<LINE>What, thinkest thou I did bid thee praise a horse?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LODOWICK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Of what condition or estate she is,</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Twere requisite that I should know, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Of such estate, that hers is as a throne,</LINE>
<LINE>And my estate the footstool where she treads:</LINE>
<LINE>Then mayst thou judge what her condition is</LINE>
<LINE>By the proportion of her mightiness.</LINE>
<LINE>Write on, while I peruse her in my thoughts.&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Her voice to music or the nightingale&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>To music every summer leaping swain</LINE>
<LINE>Compares his sunburnt lover when she speaks;</LINE>
<LINE>And why should I speak of the nightingale?</LINE>
<LINE>The nightingale sings of adulterate wrong,</LINE>
<LINE>And that, compared, is too satyrical;</LINE>
<LINE>For sin, though sin, would not be so esteemed,</LINE>
<LINE>But, rather, virtue sin, sin virtue deemed.</LINE>
<LINE>Her hair, far softer than the silk worm&#8217;s twist,</LINE>
<LINE>Like to a flattering glass, doth make more fair</LINE>
<LINE>The yellow Amber:&#8212;like a flattering glass</LINE>
<LINE>Comes in too soon; for, writing of her eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll say that like a glass they catch the sun,</LINE>
<LINE>And thence the hot reflection doth rebound</LINE>
<LINE>Against the breast, and burns my heart within.</LINE>
<LINE>Ah, what a world of descant makes my soul</LINE>
<LINE>Upon this voluntary ground of love!&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Come, Lodowick, hast thou turned thy ink to gold?</LINE>
<LINE>If not, write but in letters capital</LINE>
<LINE>My mistress&#8217; name, and it will gild thy paper:</LINE>
<LINE>Read, lord, read;</LINE>
<LINE>Fill thou the empty hollows of mine ears</LINE>
<LINE>With the sweet hearing of thy poetry.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LODOWICK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have not to a period brought her praise.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Her praise is as my love, both infinite,</LINE>
<LINE>Which apprehend such violent extremes,</LINE>
<LINE>That they disdain an ending period.</LINE>
<LINE>Her beauty hath no match but my affection;</LINE>
<LINE>Hers more than most, mine most and more than more:</LINE>
<LINE>Hers more to praise than tell the sea by drops,</LINE>
<LINE>Nay, more than drop the massy earth by sands,</LINE>
<LINE>And sand by sand print them in memory:</LINE>
<LINE>Then wherefore talkest thou of a period</LINE>
<LINE>To that which craves unended admiration?</LINE>
<LINE>Read, let us hear.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LODOWICK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE><RECITE>&#8220;More fair and chaste than is the queen of shades,&#8221;&#8212;</RECITE></LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That line hath two faults, gross and palpable:</LINE>
<LINE>Comparest thou her to the pale queen of night, </LINE>
<LINE>Who, being set in dark, seems therefore light?</LINE>
<LINE>What is she, when the sun lifts up his head,</LINE>
<LINE>But like a fading taper, dim and dead?</LINE>
<LINE>My love shall brave the eye of heaven at noon,</LINE>
<LINE>And, being unmasked, outshine the golden sun.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LODOWICK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What is the other fault, my sovereign lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Read o&#8217;er the line again.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LODOWICK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE><RECITE>&#8220;More fair and chaste&#8221;&#8212;</RECITE></LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I did not bid thee talk of chastity,</LINE>
<LINE>To ransack so the treasure of her mind;</LINE>
<LINE>For I had rather have her chased than chaste.</LINE>
<LINE>Out with the moon line, I will none of it;</LINE>
<LINE>And let me have her likened to the sun:</LINE>
<LINE>Say she hath thrice more splendour than the sun,</LINE>
<LINE>That her perfections emulate the sun,</LINE>
<LINE>That she breeds sweets as plenteous as the sun,</LINE>
<LINE>That she doth thaw cold winter like the sun,</LINE>
<LINE>That she doth cheer fresh summer like the sun,</LINE>
<LINE>The she doth dazzle gazers like the sun;</LINE>
<LINE>And, in this application to the sun,</LINE>
<LINE>Bid her be free and general as the sun,</LINE>
<LINE>Who smiles upon the basest weed that grows</LINE>
<LINE>As lovingly as on the fragrant rose.</LINE>
<LINE>Let&#8217;s see what follows that same moonlight line.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LODOWICK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8220;More fair and chaste than is the queen of shades,</LINE>
<LINE>More bold in constance&#8221;&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">In constance! Than who?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LODOWICK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8220;Than Judith was.&#8221;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O monstrous line! Put in the next a sword,</LINE>
<LINE>And I shall woo her to cut of my head.</LINE>
<LINE>Blot, blot, good Lodowick! Let us hear the next.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LODOWICK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There&#8217;s all that yet is done.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I thank thee then; thou hast done little ill,</LINE>
<LINE>But what is done, is passing, passing ill.</LINE>
<LINE>No, let the captain talk of boisterous war,</LINE>
<LINE>The prisoner of emured dark constraint,</LINE>
<LINE>The sick man best sets down the pangs of death,</LINE>
<LINE>The man that starves the sweetness of a feast,</LINE>
<LINE>The frozen soul the benefit of fire,</LINE>
<LINE>And every grief his happy opposite:</LINE>
<LINE>Love cannot sound well but in lover&#8217;s tongues;</LINE>
<LINE>Give me the pen and paper, I will write.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter Countess.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>But soft, here comes the treasurer of my spirit.&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Lodowick, thou knowst not how to draw a battle;</LINE>
<LINE>These wings, these flankers, and these squadrons</LINE>
<LINE>Argue in thee defective discipline:</LINE>
<LINE>Thou shouldest have placed this here, this other here.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pardon my boldness, my thrice gracious lords;</LINE>
<LINE>Let my intrusion here be called my duty,</LINE>
<LINE>That comes to see my sovereign how he fares.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go, draw the same, I tell thee in what form.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LODOWICK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I go.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit Lodowick.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sorry I am to see my liege so sad:</LINE>
<LINE>What may thy subject do to drive from thee</LINE>
<LINE>Thy gloomy consort, sullome melancholy?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ah, lady, I am blunt and cannot straw</LINE>
<LINE>The flowers of solace in a ground of shame:&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Since I came hither, Countess, I am wronged.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now God forbid that any in my house</LINE>
<LINE>Should think my sovereign wrong! Thrice gentle King,</LINE>
<LINE>Acquaint me with your cause of discontent.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How near then shall I be to remedy?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As near, my liege, as all my woman&#8217;s power</LINE>
<LINE>Can pawn itself to buy thy remedy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If thou speakst true, then have I my redress:</LINE>
<LINE>Engage thy power to redeem my Joys,</LINE>
<LINE>And I am joyful, Countess; else I die.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will, my Liege.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Swear, Countess, that thou wilt.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By heaven, I will.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then take thyself a little way a side,</LINE>
<LINE>And tell thyself, a king doth dote on thee;</LINE>
<LINE>Say that within thy power it doth lie</LINE>
<LINE>To make him happy, and that thou hast sworn</LINE>
<LINE>To give him all the joy within thy power:</LINE>
<LINE>Do this, and tell me when I shall be happy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>All this is done, my thrice dread sovereign: </LINE>
<LINE>That power of love, that I have power to give,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou hast with all devout obedience;</LINE>
<LINE>Employ me how thou wilt in proof thereof.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou hear&#8217;st me say that I do dote on thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If on my beauty, take it if thou canst;</LINE>
<LINE>Though little, I do prize it ten times less;</LINE>
<LINE>If on my virtue, take it if thou canst,</LINE>
<LINE>For virtue&#8217;s store by giving doth augment;</LINE>
<LINE>Be it on what it will, that I can give</LINE>
<LINE>And thou canst take away, inherit it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is thy beauty that I would enjoy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, were it painted, I would wipe it off</LINE>
<LINE>And dispossess myself, to give it thee.</LINE>
<LINE>But, sovereign, it is soldered to my life:</LINE>
<LINE>Take one and both; for, like an humble shadow,</LINE>
<LINE>It haunts the sunshine of my summer&#8217;s life.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But thou mayst lend it me to sport with all.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As easy may my intellectual soul</LINE>
<LINE>Be lent away, and yet my body live,</LINE>
<LINE>As lend my body, palace to my soul,</LINE>
<LINE>Away from her, and yet retain my soul.</LINE>
<LINE>My body is her bower, her court, her abbey,</LINE>
<LINE>And she an angel, pure, divine, unspotted:</LINE>
<LINE>If I should leave her house, my lord, to thee,</LINE>
<LINE>I kill my poor soul and my poor soul me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Didst thou not swear to give me what I would?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I did, my liege, so what you would I could.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I wish no more of thee than thou mayst give:&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Nor beg I do not, but I rather buy&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>That is, thy love; and for that love of thine</LINE>
<LINE>In rich exchange I tender to thee mine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But that your lips were sacred, my lord,</LINE>
<LINE>You would profane the holy name of love.</LINE>
<LINE>That love you offer me you cannot give,</LINE>
<LINE>For Caesar owes that tribute to his queen;</LINE>
<LINE>That love you beg of me I cannot give,</LINE>
<LINE>For Sara owes that duty to her lord.</LINE>
<LINE>He that doth clip or counterfeit your stamp</LINE>
<LINE>Shall die, my lord; and will your sacred self</LINE>
<LINE>Commit high treason against the King of Heaven,</LINE>
<LINE>To stamp his image in forbidden metal,</LINE>
<LINE>Forgetting your allegiance and your oath?</LINE>
<LINE>In violating marriage sacred law,</LINE>
<LINE>You break a greater honor than yourself:</LINE>
<LINE>To be a king is of a younger house</LINE>
<LINE>Than to be married; your progenitour,</LINE>
<LINE>Sole reigning Adam on the universe,</LINE>
<LINE>By God was honored for a married man,</LINE>
<LINE>But not by him anointed for a king.</LINE>
<LINE>It is a penalty to break your statutes,</LINE>
<LINE>Though not enacted with your highness&#8217; hand:</LINE>
<LINE>How much more, to infringe the holy act,</LINE>
<LINE>Made by the mouth of God, sealed with his hand?</LINE>
<LINE>I know, my sovereign, in my husband&#8217;s love,</LINE>
<LINE>Who now doth loyal service in his wars,</LINE>
<LINE>Doth but so try the wife of Salisbury,</LINE>
<LINE>Whither she will hear a wanton&#8217;s tale or no,</LINE>
<LINE>Lest being therein guilty by my stay,</LINE>
<LINE>From that, not from my liege, I turn away.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit.</STAGEDIR>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Whether is her beauty by her words dying,</LINE>
<LINE>Or are her words sweet chaplains to her beauty?</LINE>
<LINE>Like as the wind doth beautify a sail,</LINE>
<LINE>And as a sail becomes the unseen wind,</LINE>
<LINE>So do her words her beauties, beauties words.</LINE>
<LINE>O, that I were a honey gathering bee,</LINE>
<LINE>To bear the comb of virtue from this flower,</LINE>
<LINE>And not a poison sucking envious spider,</LINE>
<LINE>To turn the juice I take to deadly venom!</LINE>
<LINE>Religion is austere and beauty gentle;</LINE>
<LINE>Too strict a guardian for so fair a ward!</LINE>
<LINE>O, that she were, as is the air, to me!</LINE>
<LINE>Why, so she is, for when I would embrace her,</LINE>
<LINE>This do I, and catch nothing but myself.</LINE>
<LINE>I must enjoy her; for I cannot beat</LINE>
<LINE>With reason and reproof fond love a way.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter Warwick.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Here comes her father: I will work with him,</LINE>
<LINE>To bear my colours in this field of love.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WARWICK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How is it that my sovereign is so sad?</LINE>
<LINE>May I with pardon know your highness grief;</LINE>
<LINE>And that my old endeavor will remove it,</LINE>
<LINE>It shall not cumber long your majesty.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A kind and voluntary gift thou proferest,</LINE>
<LINE>That I was forward to have begged of thee.</LINE>
<LINE>But, O thou world, great nurse of flattery,</LINE>
<LINE>Why dost thou tip men&#8217;s tongues with golden words,</LINE>
<LINE>And peise their deeds with weight of heavy lead,</LINE>
<LINE>That fair performance cannot follow promise?</LINE>
<LINE>O, that a man might hold the heart&#8217;s close book</LINE>
<LINE>And choke the lavish tongue, when it doth utter</LINE>
<LINE>The breath of falsehood not charactered there!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WARWICK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Far be it from the honor of my age,</LINE>
<LINE>That I should owe bright gold and render lead;</LINE>
<LINE>Age is a cynic, not a flatterer.</LINE>
<LINE>I say again, that if I knew your grief,</LINE>
<LINE>And that by me it may be lessened,</LINE>
<LINE>My proper harm should buy your Highness&#8217; good.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>These are the vulgar tenders of false men,</LINE>
<LINE>That never pay the duty of their words.</LINE>
<LINE>Thou wilt not stick to swear what thou hast said;</LINE>
<LINE>But, when thou knowest my grief&#8217;s condition,</LINE>
<LINE>This rash disgorged vomit of thy word</LINE>
<LINE>Thou wilt eat up again, and leave me helpless.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WARWICK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By heaven, I will not, though your majesty</LINE>
<LINE>Did bid me run upon your sword and die.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Say that my grief is no way medicinable</LINE>
<LINE>But by the loss and bruising of thine honour.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WARWICK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If nothing but that loss may vantage you,</LINE>
<LINE>I would accompt that loss my vantage too.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thinkst that thou canst unswear thy oath again?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WARWICK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I cannot; nor I would not, if I could.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But, if thou dost, what shall I say to thee?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WARWICK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What may be said to any perjured villain,</LINE>
<LINE>That breaks the sacred warrant of an oath.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What wilt thou say to one that breaks an oath?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WARWICK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That he hath broke his faith with God and man,</LINE>
<LINE>And from them both stands excommunicate.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What office were it, to suggest a man</LINE>
<LINE>To break a lawful and religious vow?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WARWICK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>An office for the devil, not for man.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That devil&#8217;s office must thou do for me,</LINE>
<LINE>Or break thy oath, or cancel all the bonds</LINE>
<LINE>Of love and duty twixt thyself and me;</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore, Warwick, if thou art thyself,</LINE>
<LINE>The lord and master of thy word and oath,</LINE>
<LINE>Go to thy daughter; and in my behalf</LINE>
<LINE>Command her, woo her, win her any ways,</LINE>
<LINE>To be my mistress and my secret love.</LINE>
<LINE>I will not stand to hear thee make reply:</LINE>
<LINE>Thy oath break hers, or let thy sovereign die.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WARWICK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O doting King! O detestable office!</LINE>
<LINE>Well may I tempt myself to wrong myself,</LINE>
<LINE>When he hath sworn me by the name of God</LINE>
<LINE>To break a vow made by the name of God.</LINE>
<LINE>What, if I swear by this right hand of mine</LINE>
<LINE>To cut this right hand off? The better way</LINE>
<LINE>Were to profane the Idol than confound it:</LINE>
<LINE>But neither will I do; I&#8217;ll keep mine oath,</LINE>
<LINE>And to my daughter make a recantation</LINE>
<LINE>Of all the virtue I have preacht to her:</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll say, she must forget her husband Salisbury,</LINE>
<LINE>If she remember to embrace the king;</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll say, an oath may easily be broken,</LINE>
<LINE>But not so easily pardoned, being broken;</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll say, it is true charity to love,</LINE>
<LINE>But not true love to be so charitable;</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll say, his greatness may bear out the shame,</LINE>
<LINE>But not his kingdom can buy out the sin;</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll say, it is my duty to persuade,</LINE>
<LINE>But not her honesty to give consent.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter Countess.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>See where she comes; was never father had</LINE>
<LINE>Against his child an embassage so bad?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord and father, I have sought for you:</LINE>
<LINE>My mother and the Peers importune you</LINE>
<LINE>To keep in presence of his majesty,</LINE>
<LINE>And do your best to make his highness merry.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WARWICK.</SPEAKER>
<STAGEDIR>Aside.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>How shall I enter in this graceless arrant?</LINE>
<LINE>I must not call her child, for where&#8217;s the father</LINE>
<LINE>That will in such a suit seduce his child?</LINE>
<LINE>Then, &#8220;wife of Salisbury&#8221;; shall I so begin?</LINE>
<LINE>No, he&#8217;s my friend, and where is found the friend</LINE>
<LINE>That will do friendship such indammagement?</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>To the Countess.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Neither my daughter nor my dear friend&#8217;s wife,</LINE>
<LINE>I am not Warwick, as thou thinkst I am,</LINE>
<LINE>But an attorney from the court of hell,</LINE>
<LINE>That thus have housed my spirit in his form,</LINE>
<LINE>To do a message to thee from the king.</LINE>
<LINE>The mighty king of England dotes on thee:</LINE>
<LINE>He that hath power to take away thy life,</LINE>
<LINE>Hath power to take thy honor; then consent</LINE>
<LINE>To pawn thine honor rather than thy life:</LINE>
<LINE>Honor is often lost and got again,</LINE>
<LINE>But life, once gone, hath no recovery.</LINE>
<LINE>The sun, that withers hay, doth nourish grass;</LINE>
<LINE>The king, that would disdain thee, will advance thee.</LINE>
<LINE>The poets write that great Achilles&#8217; spear</LINE>
<LINE>Could heal the wound it made: the moral is,</LINE>
<LINE>What mighty men misdo, they can amend.</LINE>
<LINE>The lion doth become his bloody jaws,</LINE>
<LINE>And grace his forragement by being mild,</LINE>
<LINE>When vassel fear lies trembling at his feet.</LINE>
<LINE>The king will in his glory hide thy shame;</LINE>
<LINE>And those that gaze on him to find out thee,</LINE>
<LINE>Will lose their eyesight, looking in the sun.</LINE>
<LINE>What can one drop of poison harm the sea,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose huge vastures can digest the ill</LINE>
<LINE>And make it loose his operation?</LINE>
<LINE>The king&#8217;s great name will temper thy misdeeds,</LINE>
<LINE>And give the bitter potion of reproach,</LINE>
<LINE>A sugared, sweet and most delicious taste.</LINE>
<LINE>Besides, it is no harm to do the thing</LINE>
<LINE>Which without shame could not be left undone.</LINE>
<LINE>Thus have I in his majesty&#8217;s behalf</LINE>
<LINE>Appareled sin in virtuous sentences,</LINE>
<LINE>And dwell upon thy answer in his suit.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Unnatural besiege! Woe me unhappy,</LINE>
<LINE>To have escaped the danger of my foes,</LINE>
<LINE>And to be ten times worse injured by friends!</LINE>
<LINE>Hath he no means to stain my honest blood,</LINE>
<LINE>But to corrupt the author of my blood</LINE>
<LINE>To be his scandalous and vile solicitor?</LINE>
<LINE>No marvel though the branches be then infected,</LINE>
<LINE>When poison hath encompassed the root:</LINE>
<LINE>No marvel though the leprous infant die,</LINE>
<LINE>When the stern dame invenometh the Dug.</LINE>
<LINE>Why then, give sin a passport to offend,</LINE>
<LINE>And youth the dangerous reign of liberty:</LINE>
<LINE>Blot out the strict forbidding of the law,</LINE>
<LINE>And cancel every cannon that prescribes</LINE>
<LINE>A shame for shame or penance for offence.</LINE>
<LINE>No, let me die, if his too boistrous will</LINE>
<LINE>Will have it so, before I will consent</LINE>
<LINE>To be an actor in his graceless lust.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WARWICK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, now thou speakst as I would have thee speak:</LINE>
<LINE>And mark how I unsay my words again.</LINE>
<LINE>An honorable grave is more esteemed</LINE>
<LINE>Than the polluted closet of a king:</LINE>
<LINE>The greater man, the greater is the thing,</LINE>
<LINE>Be it good or bad, that he shall undertake:</LINE>
<LINE>An unreputed mote, flying in the sun,</LINE>
<LINE>Presents a greater substance than it is:</LINE>
<LINE>The freshest summer&#8217;s day doth soonest taint</LINE>
<LINE>The loathed carrion that it seems to kiss:</LINE>
<LINE>Deep are the blows made with a mighty axe:</LINE>
<LINE>That sin doth ten times aggravate itself,</LINE>
<LINE>That is committed in a holy place:</LINE>
<LINE>An evil deed, done by authority,</LINE>
<LINE>Is sin and subornation: deck an ape</LINE>
<LINE>In tissue, and the beauty of the robe</LINE>
<LINE>Adds but the greater scorn unto the beast.</LINE>
<LINE>A spatious field of reasons could I urge</LINE>
<LINE>Between his glory, daughter, and thy shame:</LINE>
<LINE>That poison shews worst in a golden cup;</LINE>
<LINE>Dark night seems darker by the lightning flash;</LINE>
<LINE>Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds;</LINE>
<LINE>And every glory that inclines to sin,</LINE>
<LINE>The shame is treble by the opposite.</LINE>
<LINE>So leave I with my blessing in thy bosom,</LINE>
<LINE>Which then convert to a most heavy curse,</LINE>
<LINE>When thou convertest from honor&#8217;s golden name</LINE>
<LINE>To the black faction of bed blotting shame.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll follow thee; and when my mind turns so,</LINE>
<LINE>My body sink my soul in endless woe!</LINE>

<LINE>Thrice noble Audley, well encount&#8217;red here!</LINE>
<LINE>How is it with our sovereign and his peers?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUDLEY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis full a fortnight, since I saw his highness</LINE>
<LINE>What time he sent me forth to muster men;</LINE>
<LINE>Which I accordingly have done, and bring them hither</LINE>
<LINE>In fair array before his majesty.</LINE>
<LINE>What news, my Lord of Derby, from the Emperor?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DERBY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As good as we desire: the Emperor</LINE>
<LINE>Hath yielded to his highness friendly aid,</LINE>
<LINE>And makes our king lieutenant general</LINE>
<LINE>In all his lands and large dominions;</LINE>
<LINE>Then <ITALIAN lang="it">via</ITALIAN>! For the spatious bounds of France!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUDLEY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, doth his highness leap to hear these news?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DERBY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have not yet found time to open them;</LINE>
<LINE>The king is in his closet, malcontent;</LINE>
<LINE>For what, I know not, but he gave in charge,</LINE>
<LINE>Till after dinner none should interrupt him:</LINE>
<LINE>The Countess Salisbury and her father Warwick,</LINE>
<LINE>Artois and all look underneath the brows.</LINE>

<LINE>All love and duty to my lord the King!</LINE>

<LINE>Well, all but one is none.&#8212;What news with you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUDLEY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have, my liege, levied those horse and foot</LINE>
<LINE>According to your charge, and brought them hither.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then let those foot trudge hence upon those horse</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thus from the heart&#8217;s aboundance speaks the tongue;</LINE>
<LINE>Countess for Emperor: and, indeed, why not?</LINE>
<LINE>She is as imperator over me, and I to her</LINE>
<LINE>Am as a kneeling vassal, that observes</LINE>
<LINE>The pleasure or displeasure of her eye.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter Lodowick.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>What says the more than Cleopatra&#8217;s match</LINE>
<LINE>To Caesar now?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LODOWICK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That yet, my liege, ere night</LINE>
<LINE>She will resolve your majesty.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Drum within.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What drum is this that thunders forth this march,</LINE>
<LINE>To start the tender Cupid in my bosom?</LINE>
<LINE>Poor sheepskin, how it brawls with him that beateth it!</LINE>
<LINE>Go, break the thundring parchment bottom out,</LINE>
<LINE>And I will teach it to conduct sweet lines</LINE>
<LINE>Unto the bosom of a heavenly nymph;</LINE>
<LINE>For I will use it as my writing paper,</LINE>
<LINE>And so reduce him from a scolding drum</LINE>
<LINE>To be the herald and dear counsel bearer</LINE>
<LINE>Betwixt a goddess and a mighty king.</LINE>
<LINE>Go, bid the drummer learn to touch the Lute,</LINE>
<LINE>Or hang him in the braces of his drum,</LINE>
<LINE>For now we think it an uncivil thing,</LINE>
<LINE>To trouble heaven with such harsh resounds:</LINE>
<LINE>Away!</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit Lodowick.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>The quarrel that I have requires no arms</LINE>
<LINE>But these of mine: and these shall meet my foe</LINE>
<LINE>In a deep march of penetrable groans;</LINE>
<LINE>My eyes shall be my arrows, and my sighs</LINE>
<LINE>Shall serve me as the vantage of the wind,</LINE>
<LINE>To whirl away my sweetest artillery.</LINE>
<LINE>Ah, but, alas, she wins the sun of me,</LINE>
<LINE>For that is she herself, and thence it comes</LINE>
<LINE>That poets term the wanton warrior blind;</LINE>
<LINE>But love hath eyes as judgement to his steps,</LINE>
<LINE>Till too much loved glory dazzles them.&#8212;</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter Lodowick.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>How now?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LODOWICK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My liege, the drum that stroke the lusty march,</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Prince Edward.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I see the boy; oh, how his mother&#8217;s face,</LINE>
<LINE>Modeled in his, corrects my strayed desire,</LINE>
<LINE>And rates my heart, and chides my thievish eye,</LINE>
<LINE>Who, being rich enough in seeing her,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet seeks elsewhere: and basest theft is that</LINE>
<LINE>Which cannot cloak itself on poverty.&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Now, boy, what news?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have assembled, my dear lord and father,</LINE>
<LINE>The choicest buds of all our English blood</LINE>
<LINE>For our affairs in France; and here we come</LINE>
<LINE>To take direction from your majesty.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Still do I see in him delineate</LINE>
<LINE>His mother&#8217;s visage; those his eyes are hers,</LINE>
<LINE>Who, looking wistely on me, make me blush:</LINE>
<LINE>For faults against themselves give evidence;</LINE>
<LINE>Lust is fire, and men like lanthornes show</LINE>
<LINE>Light lust within themselves, even through themselves.</LINE>
<LINE>Away, loose silks of wavering vanity!</LINE>
<LINE>Shall the large limit of fair Britain</LINE>
<LINE>By me be overthrown, and shall I not</LINE>
<LINE>Master this little mansion of myself?</LINE>
<LINE>Give me an armor of eternal steel!</LINE>
<LINE>I go to conquer kings; and shall I not then</LINE>
<LINE>Subdue myself? And be my enemy&#8217;s friend?</LINE>
<LINE>It must not be.&#8212;Come, boy, forward, advance!</LINE>
<LINE>Let&#8217;s with our colours sweet the air of France.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Lodowick.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LODOWICK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My liege, the Countess with a smiling cheer</LINE>
<LINE>Desires access unto your Majesty.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, there it goes! That very smile of hers</LINE>
<LINE>Hath ransomed captive France, and set the King,</LINE>
<LINE>The Dauphin, and the peers at liberty.&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Go, leave me, Ned, and revel with thy friends.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit Prince Edward.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Thy mother is but black, and thou, like her,</LINE>
<LINE>Dost put it in my mind how foul she is.&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Go, fetch the Countess hither in thy hand,</LINE>
<LINE>And let her chase away these winter clouds,</LINE>
<LINE>For she gives beauty both to heaven and earth.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit Lodowick.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>The sin is more to hack and hew poor men,</LINE>
<LINE>Than to embrace in an unlawful bed</LINE>
<LINE>The register of all rarities</LINE>
<LINE>Since leatheren Adam till this youngest hour.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter Countess escorted by Lodowick.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Go, Lodowick, put thy hand into my purse,</LINE>
<LINE>Play, spend, give, riot, waste, do what thou wilt,</LINE>
<LINE>So thou wilt hence awhile and leave me here.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit Lodowick.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Now, my soul&#8217;s playfellow, art thou come</LINE>
<LINE>To speak the more than heavenly word of &#8220;yea&#8221;</LINE>
<LINE>To my objection in thy beauteous love?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My father on his blessing hath commanded&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That thou shalt yield to me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Aye, dear my liege, your due.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And that, my dearest love, can be no less</LINE>
<LINE>Than right for right and tender love for love.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then wrong for wrong and endless hate for hate.&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>But,&#8212;sith I see your majesty so bent,</LINE>
<LINE>That my unwillingness, my husband&#8217;s love,</LINE>
<LINE>Your high estate, nor no respect respected</LINE>
<LINE>Can be my help, but that your mightiness</LINE>
<LINE>Will overbear and awe these dear regards&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>I bind my discontent to my content,</LINE>
<LINE>And what I would not I&#8217;ll compel I will,</LINE>
<LINE>Provided that yourself remove those lets</LINE>
<LINE>That stand between your highness&#8217; love and mine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Name them, fair Countess, and, by heaven, I will.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is their lives that stand between our love,</LINE>
<LINE>That I would have choked up, my sovereign.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Whose lives, my Lady?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">My thrice loving liege,</LINE>
<LINE>Your Queen and Salisbury, my wedded husband,</LINE>
<LINE>Who living have that title in our love,</LINE>
<LINE>That we cannot bestow but by their death.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thy opposition is beyond our Law.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So is your desire: if the law</LINE>
<LINE>Can hinder you to execute the one,</LINE>
<LINE>Let it forbid you to attempt the other.</LINE>
<LINE>I cannot think you love me as you say,</LINE>
<LINE>Unless you do make good what you have sworn.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No more; thy husband and the Queen shall die.</LINE>
<LINE>Fairer thou art by far than Hero was,</LINE>
<LINE>Beardless Leander not so strong as I:</LINE>
<LINE>He swom an easy current for his love,</LINE>
<LINE>But I will through a Hellespont of blood,</LINE>
<LINE>To arrive at Sestos where my Hero lies.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, You&#8217;ll do more; You&#8217;ll make the river to</LINE>
<LINE>With their heart bloods that keep our love asunder,</LINE>
<LINE>Of which my husband and your wife are twain.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thy beauty makes them guilty of their death</LINE>
<LINE>And gives in evidence that they shall die;</LINE>
<LINE>Upon which verdict I, their Judge, condemn them.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS.</SPEAKER>
<STAGEDIR>Aside.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>O perjured beauty, more corrupted judge!</LINE>
<LINE>When to the great star-chamber o&#8217;er our heads</LINE>
<LINE>The universal sessions calls to count</LINE>
<LINE>This packing evil, we both shall tremble for it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What says my fair love? Is she resolute?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COUNTESS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Resolute to be dissolute; and, therefore, this:</LINE>
<LINE>Keep but thy word, great king, and I am thine.</LINE>
<LINE>Stand where thou dost, I&#8217;ll part a little from thee,</LINE>
<LINE>And see how I will yield me to thy hands.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Turning suddenly upon him, and showing two daggers.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Here by my side doth hang my wedding knifes:</LINE>
<LINE>Take thou the one, and with it kill thy Queen,</LINE>
<LINE>And learn by me to find her where she lies;</LINE>
<LINE>And with this other I&#8217;ll dispatch my love,</LINE>
<LINE>Which now lies fast a sleep within my heart:</LINE>
<LINE>When they are gone, then I&#8217;ll consent to love.</LINE>
<LINE>Stir not, lascivious king, to hinder me;</LINE>
<LINE>My resolution is more nimbler far,</LINE>
<LINE>Than thy prevention can be in my rescue,</LINE>
<LINE>And if thou stir, I strike; therefore, stand still,</LINE>
<LINE>And hear the choice that I will put thee to:</LINE>
<LINE>Either swear to leave thy most unholy suit</LINE>
<LINE>And never hence forth to solicit me;</LINE>
<LINE>Or else, by heaven, this sharp-pointed knife</LINE>
<LINE>Shall stain thy earth with that which thou would stain,</LINE>
<LINE>My poor chaste blood. Swear, Edward, swear,</LINE>
<LINE>Or I will strike and die before thee here.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Even by that power I swear, that gives me now</LINE>
<LINE>The power to be ashamed of myself,</LINE>
<LINE>I never mean to part my lips again</LINE>
<LINE>In any words that tends to such a suit.</LINE>
<LINE>Arise, true English lady, whom our isle</LINE>
<LINE>May better boast of than ever Roman might</LINE>
<LINE>Of her, whose ransacked treasury hath taskt</LINE>
<LINE>The vain endeavor of so many pens:</LINE>
<LINE>Arise, and be my fault thy honor&#8217;s fame,</LINE>
<LINE>Which after ages shall enrich thee with.</LINE>
<LINE>I am awakened from this idle dream.&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Warwick, my son, Darby, Artois, and Audley!</LINE>
<LINE>Brave warriors all, where are you all this while?</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter all.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Warwick, I make thee Warden of the North:&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Thou, Prince of Wales, and Audley, straight to sea;</LINE>
<LINE>Scour to Newhaven; some there stay for me:</LINE>
<LINE>Myself, Artois, and Darby will through Flanders,</LINE>
<LINE>To greet our friends there and to crave their aide.</LINE>
<LINE>This night will scarce suffice a faithful lover;</LINE>
<LINE>For, ere the sun shall gild the eastern sky,</LINE>

<LINE>Here, till our navy of a thousand sail</LINE>

<LINE>To lay aside unnecessary soothing,</LINE>

<LINE>England was wont to harbour malcontents,</LINE>
<LINE>Blood thirsty and seditious Catelynes,</LINE>
<LINE>Spend thrifts, and such as gape for nothing else</LINE>

<LINE>All but the Scot, who solemnly protests,</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ah, that&#8217;s the anchorage of some better hope!</LINE>
<LINE>But, on the other side, to think what friends</LINE>
<LINE>King Edward hath retained in Netherland,</LINE>
<LINE>Among those ever-bibbing Epicures,</LINE>
<LINE>Those frothy Dutch men, puff&#8217;d with double beer,</LINE>
<LINE>That drink and swill in every place they come,</LINE>
<LINE>Doth not a little aggravate mine ire;</LINE>
<LINE>Besides, we hear, the Emperor conjoins,</LINE>
<LINE>And stalls him in his own authority;</LINE>
<LINE>But, all the mightier that their number is,</LINE>
<LINE>The greater glory reaps the victory.</LINE>
<LINE>Some friends have we beside domestic power;</LINE>
<LINE>The stern Polonian, and the warlike Dane,</LINE>
<LINE>The King of Boheme and of Sicily,</LINE>
<LINE>Are all become confederates with us,</LINE>
<LINE>And, as I think, are marching hither apace.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Drum within.</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>And from great Moscow, fearful to the Turk,</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Welcome, Bohemian king, and welcome all:</LINE>
<LINE>This your great kindness I will not forget.</LINE>
<LINE>Besides your plentiful rewards in crowns,</LINE>
<LINE>That from our treasury ye shall receive,</LINE>
<LINE>There comes a hare brained nation, decked in pride,</LINE>
<LINE>The spoil of whom will be a treble gain.</LINE>
<LINE>And now my hope is full, my joy complete:</LINE>
<LINE>At sea, we are as puissant as the force</LINE>
<LINE>Of Agamemnon in the haven of Troy;</LINE>
<LINE>By land, with Zerxes we compare of strength,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose soldiers drank up rivers in their thirst;</LINE>
<LINE>Then Bayard-like, blind, overweaning Ned,</LINE>
<LINE>To reach at our imperial diadem</LINE>
<LINE>Is either to be swallowed of the waves,</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter French Mariner.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FR. MARINER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Near to the coast I have descried, my lord,</LINE>
<LINE>As I was buy in my watchful charge,</LINE>
<LINE>The proud armado of King Edward&#8217;s ships:</LINE>
<LINE>Which, at the first, far off when I did ken,</LINE>
<LINE>Seemed as it were a grove of withered pines;</LINE>
<LINE>But, drawing near, their glorious bright aspect,</LINE>
<LINE>Their streaming ensigns, wrought of coloured silk,</LINE>
<LINE>Like to a meadow full of sundry flowers,</LINE>
<LINE>Adorns the naked bosom of the earth:</LINE>
<LINE>Majestical the order of their course,</LINE>
<LINE>Figuring the horned circle of the moon:</LINE>
<LINE>And on the top gallant of the admiral</LINE>
<LINE>And likewise all the handmaids of his train</LINE>
<LINE>The arms of England and of France unite</LINE>
<LINE>Are quartered equally by heralds&#8217; art:</LINE>
<LINE>Thus, tightly carried with a merry gale,</LINE>
<LINE>They plough the ocean hitherward amain.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>KING JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Dare he already crop the Fleur de Luce?</LINE>
<LINE>I hope, the honey being gathered thence,</LINE>
<LINE>He, with the spider, afterward approached,</LINE>
<LINE>Shall suck forth deadly venom from the leaves.&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>But where&#8217;s our navy? How are they prepared</LINE>
<LINE>To wing themselves against this flight of ravens?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FR. MARINER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>They, having knowledge, brought them by the scouts,</LINE>
<LINE>Did break from Anchor straight, and, puffed with rage,</LINE>
<LINE>No otherwise then were their sails with wind,</LINE>
<LINE>Made forth, as when the empty eagle flies,</LINE>
<LINE>To satisfy his hungry griping maw.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There&#8217;s for thy news. Return unto thy bark;</LINE>

<LINE>And do survive the conflict, come again,</LINE>
<LINE>And let us hear the manner of the fight.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit French Mariner.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Mean space, my lords, &#8217;tis best we be dispersed</LINE>
<LINE>To several places, least they chance to land:</LINE>
<LINE>First you, my lord, with your Bohemian troops,</LINE>
<LINE>Shall pitch your battailes on the lower hand;</LINE>
<LINE>My eldest son, the Duke of Normandy,</LINE>
<LINE>Together with the aide of Muscovites,</LINE>
<LINE>Shall climb the higher ground another way;</LINE>
<LINE>Here in the middle cost, betwixt you both,</LINE>
<LINE>Phillip, my youngest boy, and I will lodge.</LINE>
<LINE>So, lords, be gone, and look unto your charge:</LINE>
<LINE>You stand for France, an empire fair and large.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exeunt.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Now tell me, Phillip, what is thy concept,</LINE>
<LINE>Touching the challenge that the English make?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PHILLIP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I say, my lord, claim Edward what he can,</LINE>
<LINE>And bring he ne&#8217;er so plain a pedigree,</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis you are in the possession of the crown,</LINE>
<LINE>And that&#8217;s the surest point of all the law:</LINE>
<LINE>But, were it not, yet ere he should prevail,</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll make a conduit of my dearest blood,</LINE>
<LINE>Or chase those straggling upstarts home again.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well said, young Phillip! Call for bread and wine,</LINE>
<LINE>That we may cheer our stomachs with repast,</LINE>
<LINE>To look our foes more sternly in the face.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>A table and provisions brought in. The battle hard a far off.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Now is begun the heavy day at sea:</LINE>
<LINE>Fight, Frenchmen, fight! Be like the field of bears,</LINE>
<LINE>When they defend their younglings in the caves!</LINE>
<LINE>Stir, angry nemesis, the happy helm,</LINE>
<LINE>That, with the sulphur battles of your rage,</LINE>
<LINE>The English fleet may be dispersed and sunk.</LINE>

<LINE>O Father, how this echoing cannon shot,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, boy, thou hearest what thundering terror &#8217;tis</LINE>
<LINE>To buckle for a kingdom&#8217;s sovereignty:</LINE>
<LINE>The earth, with giddy trembling when it shakes,</LINE>
<LINE>Or when the exhalations of the air</LINE>
<LINE>Breaks in extremity of lightning flash,</LINE>
<LINE>Affrights not more than kings, when they dispose</LINE>
<LINE>To shew the rancor of their high swollen hearts.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Retreat.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Retreat is sounded; one side hath the worse;</LINE>
<LINE>O, if it be the French, sweet fortune, turn;</LINE>
<LINE>And, in thy turning, change the forward winds,</LINE>
<LINE>That, with advantage of a favoring sky,</LINE>
<LINE>Our men may vanquish, and the other fly!</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter French Mariner.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>My heart misgives:&#8212;say, mirror of pale death,</LINE>
<LINE>To whom belongs the honor of this day?</LINE>
<LINE>Relate, I pray thee, if thy breath will serve,</LINE>
<LINE>The sad discourse of this discomfiture.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FR. MARINER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will, my lord.</LINE>
<LINE>My gracious sovereign, Franch hath ta&#8217;en the foil,</LINE>
<LINE>And boasting Edward triumphs with success.</LINE>
<LINE>These iron-hearted navies,</LINE>
<LINE>When last I was reporter to your grace,</LINE>
<LINE>Both full of angry spleen, of hope, and fear,</LINE>
<LINE>Hasting to meet each other in the face,</LINE>
<LINE>At last conjoined; and by their admiral</LINE>
<LINE>Our admiral encountered many shot:</LINE>
<LINE>By this, the other, that beheld these twain</LINE>
<LINE>Give earnest penny of a further wrack,</LINE>
<LINE>Like fiery dragons took their haughty flight;</LINE>
<LINE>And, likewise meeting, from their smoky wombs</LINE>
<LINE>Sent many grim ambassadors of death.</LINE>
<LINE>Then &#8217;gan the day to turn to gloomy night,</LINE>
<LINE>And darkness did as well enclose the quick</LINE>
<LINE>As those that were but newly reft of life.</LINE>
<LINE>No leisure served for friends to bid farewell;</LINE>
<LINE>And, if it had, the hideous noise was such,</LINE>
<LINE>As each to other seemed deaf and dumb.</LINE>
<LINE>Purple the sea, whose channel filled as fast</LINE>
<LINE>With streaming gore, that from the maimed fell,</LINE>
<LINE>As did her gushing moisture break into</LINE>
<LINE>The crannied cleftures of the through shot planks.</LINE>
<LINE>Here flew a head, dissever&#8217;d from the trunk,</LINE>
<LINE>There mangled arms and legs were tossed aloft,</LINE>
<LINE>As when a whirl wind takes the summer dust</LINE>
<LINE>And scatters it in middle of the air.</LINE>
<LINE>Then might ye see the reeling vessels split,</LINE>
<LINE>And tottering sink into the ruthless flood,</LINE>
<LINE>Until their lofty tops were seen no more.</LINE>
<LINE>All shifts were tried, both for defence and hurt:</LINE>
<LINE>And now the effect of valor and of force,</LINE>
<LINE>Of resolution and of cowardice,</LINE>
<LINE>We lively pictures; how the one for fame,</LINE>
<LINE>The other by compulsion laid about;</LINE>
<LINE>Much did the Nonpareille, that brave ship;</LINE>
<LINE>So did the Black Snake of Bullen, then which</LINE>
<LINE>A bonnier vessel never yet spread sail.</LINE>
<LINE>But all in vain; both sun, the wind and tide,</LINE>
<LINE>Revolted all unto our foe men&#8217;s side,</LINE>
<LINE>That we perforce were fain to give them way,</LINE>
<LINE>And they are landed.&#8212;Thus my tale is done:</LINE>
<LINE>We have untimely lost, and they have won.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then rests there nothing, but with present speed</LINE>
<LINE>To join our several forces all in one,</LINE>
<LINE>And bid them battle, ere they range too far.</LINE>
<LINE>Come, gentle Phillip, let us hence depart;</LINE>
<LINE>This soldier&#8217;s words have pierced thy father&#8217;s heart.</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Aye, so the grasshopper doth spend the time</LINE>

<LINE>And then too late he would redeem his time,</LINE>
<LINE>When frozen cold hath nipped his careless head.</LINE>
<LINE>He, that no sooner will provide a cloak,</LINE>
<LINE>Then when he sees it doth begin to reign,</LINE>
<LINE>May, peradventure, for his negligence,</LINE>
<LINE>Be throughly washed, when he suspects it not.</LINE>
<LINE>We that have charge and such a train as this,</LINE>

<LINE>For so far of as I directed mine eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>I might perceive five cities all on fire,</LINE>
<LINE>Corn fields and vineyards, burning like an oven;</LINE>
<LINE>And, as the reaking vapour in the wind</LINE>
<LINE>Turned but aside, I like wise might discern</LINE>
<LINE>The poor inhabitants, escaped the flame,</LINE>
<LINE>Fall numberless upon the soldiers&#8217; pikes.</LINE>
<LINE>Three ways these dreadful ministers of wrath</LINE>
<LINE>Do tread the measures of their tragic march:</LINE>
<LINE>Upon the right hand comes the conquering King,</LINE>
<LINE>Upon the left his hot unbridled son,</LINE>
<LINE>And in the midst our nation&#8217;s glittering host,</LINE>
<LINE>All which, though distant yet, conspire in one, </LINE>
<LINE>To leave a desolation where they come.</LINE>
<LINE>Fly therefore, citizens, if you be wise,</LINE>

<LINE>Successfully, I thank the gracious heavens:</LINE>
<LINE>Some of their strongest cities we have won, </LINE>
<LINE>As Harflew, Lo, Crotay, and Carentigne,</LINE>
<LINE>And others wasted, leaving at our heels</LINE>
<LINE>A wide apparent field and beaten path</LINE>
<LINE>For solitariness to progress in:</LINE>
<LINE>Yet those that would submit we kindly pardoned,</LINE>
<LINE>But who in scorn refused our proffered peace,</LINE>
<LINE>Endured the penalty of sharp revenge.</LINE>

<LINE>Ah, France, why shouldest thou be thus obstinate</LINE>
<LINE>Against the kind embracement of thy friends?</LINE>

<LINE>But that, in froward and disdainful pride,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou, like a skittish and untamed colt,</LINE>
<LINE>Dost start aside and strike us with thy heels!</LINE>
<LINE>But tell me, Ned, in all thy warlike course,</LINE>
<LINE>Hast thou not seen the usurping King of France?</LINE>

<LINE>Upon the one side of the river&#8217;s bank</LINE>
<LINE>And on the other both, his multitudes.</LINE>
<LINE>I feared he would have cropped our smaller power:</LINE>
<LINE>But happily, perceiving your approach,</LINE>
<LINE>He hath with drawn himself to Cressy plains;</LINE>
<LINE>Where, as it seemeth by his good array,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Edward, know that John, the true king of France,</LINE>
<LINE>Musing thou shouldst encroach upon his land,</LINE>
<LINE>And in thy tyranous proceeding slay</LINE>
<LINE>His faithful subjects and subvert his towns,</LINE>
<LINE>Spits in thy face; and in this manner following</LINE>
<LINE>Obraids thee with thine arrogant intrusion:</LINE>
<LINE>First, I condemn thee for a fugitive,</LINE>
<LINE>A thievish pirate, and a needy mate,</LINE>
<LINE>One that hath either no abiding place,</LINE>
<LINE>Or else, inhabiting some barren soil,</LINE>
<LINE>Where neither herb or fruitful grain is had,</LINE>
<LINE>Doest altogether live by pilfering:</LINE>
<LINE>Next, insomuch thou hast infringed thy faith,</LINE>
<LINE>Broke league and solemn covenant made with me,</LINE>
<LINE>I hold thee for a false pernicious wretch:</LINE>
<LINE>And, last of all, although I scorn to cope</LINE>
<LINE>With one so much inferior to myself,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet, in respect thy thirst is all for gold,</LINE>
<LINE>Thy labour rather to be feared than loved,</LINE>
<LINE>To satisfy thy lust in either part,</LINE>
<LINE>Here am I come, and with me have I brought</LINE>
<LINE>Exceeding store of treasure, pearl, and coin.</LINE>
<LINE>Leave, therefore, now to persecute the weak,</LINE>
<LINE>And armed entering conflict with the armed,</LINE>
<LINE>Let it be seen, &#8217;mongst other petty thefts,</LINE>
<LINE>How thou canst win this pillage manfully.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If gall or wormwood have a pleasant taste,</LINE>
<LINE>Then is thy salutation honey sweet;</LINE>
<LINE>But as the one hath no such property,</LINE>
<LINE>So is the other most satirical.</LINE>
<LINE>Yet wot how I regard thy worthless taunts:</LINE>
<LINE>If thou have uttered them to foil my fame</LINE>
<LINE>Or dim the reputation of my birth,</LINE>
<LINE>Know that thy wolvish barking cannot hurt;</LINE>
<LINE>If slyly to insinuate with the world,</LINE>
<LINE>And with a strumpet&#8217;s artificial line</LINE>
<LINE>To paint thy vicious and deformed cause,</LINE>
<LINE>Be well assured, the counterfeit will fade,</LINE>
<LINE>And in the end thy foul defects be seen;</LINE>
<LINE>But if thou didst it to provoke me on,</LINE>
<LINE>As who should say I were but timorous.</LINE>
<LINE>Or, coldly negligent, did need a spur,</LINE>
<LINE>Bethink thyself how slack I was at sea,</LINE>
<LINE>How since my landing I have won no towns,</LINE>
<LINE>Entered no further but upon the coast,</LINE>
<LINE>And there have ever since securely slept.</LINE>
<LINE>But if I have been other wise employed,</LINE>
<LINE>Imagine, Valois, whether I intend</LINE>
<LINE>To skirmish, not for pillage, but for the crown</LINE>
<LINE>Which thou dost wear; and that I vow to have,</LINE>
<LINE>Or one of us shall fall into his grave.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Look not for cross invectives at our hands,</LINE>
<LINE>Or railing execrations of despite:</LINE>
<LINE>Let creeping serpents, hid in hollow banks,</LINE>
<LINE>Sting with their tongues; we have remorseless swords,</LINE>
<LINE>And they shall plead for us and our affairs.</LINE>
<LINE>Yet thus much, briefly, by my father&#8217;s leave:</LINE>
<LINE>As all the immodest poison of thy throat</LINE>
<LINE>Is scandalous and most notorious lies,</LINE>
<LINE>And our pretended quarrel is truly just,</LINE>
<LINE>So end the battle when we meet today:</LINE>
<LINE>May either of us prosper and prevail,</LINE>
<LINE>Or, luckless, curst, receive eternal shame!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That needs no further question; and I know,</LINE>
<LINE>His conscience witnesseth, it is my right.&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore, Valois, say, wilt thou yet resign,</LINE>
<LINE>Before the sickles thrust into the corn,</LINE>
<LINE>Or that inkindled fury turn to flame?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Edward, I know what right thou hast in France;</LINE>
<LINE>And ere I basely will resign my crown,</LINE>
<LINE>This champion field shall be a pool of blood,</LINE>
<LINE>And all our prospect as a slaughter house.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Aye, that approves thee, tyrant, what thou art:</LINE>
<LINE>No father, king, or shepherd of thy realm,</LINE>
<LINE>But one, that tears her entrails with thy hands,</LINE>
<LINE>And, like a thirsty tyger, suckst her blood.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUDLEY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You peers of France, why do you follow him</LINE>
<LINE>That is so prodigal to spend your lives?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Whom should they follow, aged impotent,</LINE>
<LINE>But he that is their true borne sovereign?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Obraidst thou him, because within his face</LINE>
<LINE>Time hath ingraved deep characters of age?</LINE>
<LINE>Know, these grave scholars of experience,</LINE>
<LINE>Like stiff grown oaks, will stand immovable,</LINE>
<LINE>When whirl wind quickly turns up younger trees.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DARBY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Was ever any of thy father&#8217;s house</LINE>
<LINE>King but thyself, before this present time?</LINE>
<LINE>Edward&#8217;s great linage, by the mother&#8217;s side,</LINE>
<LINE>Five hundred years hath held the scepter up:</LINE>
<LINE>Judge then, conspiratours, by this descent,</LINE>
<LINE>Which is the true borne sovereign, this or that.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PHILIP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Father, range your battles, prate no more;</LINE>
<LINE>These English fain would spend the time in words,</LINE>
<LINE>That, night approaching, they might escape unfought.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Lords and my loving subjects, now&#8217;s the time,</LINE>
<LINE>That your intended force must bide the touch.</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore, my friends, consider this in brief:</LINE>
<LINE>He that you fight for is your natural King;</LINE>
<LINE>He against whom you fight, a foreigner:</LINE>
<LINE>He that you fight for, rules in clemency,</LINE>
<LINE>And reins you with a mild and gentle bit;</LINE>
<LINE>He against whom you fight, if he prevail,</LINE>
<LINE>Will straight inthrone himself in tyranny,</LINE>
<LINE>Makes slaves of you, and with a heavy hand</LINE>
<LINE>Curtail and curb your sweetest liberty.</LINE>
<LINE>Then, to protect your country and your King,</LINE>
<LINE>Let but the haughty courage of your hearts</LINE>
<LINE>Answer the number of your able hands,</LINE>
<LINE>And we shall quickly chase these fugitives.</LINE>
<LINE>For what&#8217;s this Edward but a belly god,</LINE>
<LINE>A tender and lascivious wantoness,</LINE>
<LINE>That thother day was almost dead for love?</LINE>
<LINE>And what, I pray you, is his goodly guard?</LINE>
<LINE>Such as, but scant them of their chines of beef</LINE>
<LINE>And take away their downy featherbeds,</LINE>
<LINE>And presently they are as resty stiff,</LINE>
<LINE>As &#8217;twere a many over ridden jades.</LINE>
<LINE>Then, Frenchmen, scorn that such should be your lords,</LINE>
<LINE>And rather bind ye them in captive bands.</LINE>

<LINE><FRENCH lang="fr">Vive le Roy!</FRENCH> God save King John of France!</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now on this plain of Cressy spread yourselves,&#8212;</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt King John, Charles, Philip, Lorraine, Boheme, and forces.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We presently will meet thee, John of France:&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>And, English lords, let us resolve this day,</LINE>
<LINE>Either to clear us of that scandalous crime,</LINE>
<LINE>Or be intombed in our innocence.</LINE>
<LINE>And, Ned, because this battle is the first</LINE>
<LINE>That ever yet thou foughtest in pitched field,</LINE>
<LINE>As ancient custom is of martialists,</LINE>
<LINE>To dub thee with the tip of chivalry,</LINE>
<LINE>In solemn manner we will give thee arms.</LINE>
<LINE>Come, therefore, heralds, orderly bring forth</LINE>
<LINE>A strong attirement for the prince my son.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter four Heralds, bringing in a coat-armor, a helmet, a lance, and a shield. The first Herald delivers the armor to King Edward, who puts it on his son.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Edward Plantagenet, in the name of God,</LINE>
<LINE>As with this armor I impale thy breast,</LINE>
<LINE>So be thy noble unrelenting heart</LINE>
<LINE>Walled in with flint of matchless fortitude,</LINE>
<LINE>That never base affections enter there:</LINE>
<LINE>Fight and be valiant, conquer where thou comest!</LINE>
<LINE>Now follow, lords, and do him honor to.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DARBY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Edward Plantagenet, prince of Wales,</LINE>
<LINE>As I do set this helmet on thy head,</LINE>
<LINE>Wherewith the chamber of thy brain is fenc&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>So may thy temples, with Bellona&#8217;s hand,</LINE>
<LINE>Be still adorned with laurel victory:</LINE>
<LINE>Fight and be valiant, conquer where thou comest!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUDLEY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Edward Plantagenet, prince of Wales,</LINE>
<LINE>Receive this lance into thy manly hand;</LINE>
<LINE>Use it in fashion of a brazen pen,</LINE>
<LINE>To draw forth bloody stratagems in France,</LINE>
<LINE>And print thy valiant deeds in honor&#8217;s book:</LINE>
<LINE>Fight and be valiant, vanquish where thou comest!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARTOIS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Edward Plantagenet, prince of Wales,</LINE>
<LINE>Hold, take this target, wear it on thy arm;</LINE>
<LINE>And may the view thereof, like Perseus&#8217; shield,</LINE>
<LINE>Astonish and transform thy gazing foes</LINE>
<LINE>To senseless images of meager death:</LINE>
<LINE>Fight and be valiant, conquer where thou comest!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now wants there nought but knighthood, which deferred</LINE>
<LINE>We leave, till thou hast won it in the field.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My gracious father and ye forward peers,</LINE>
<LINE>This honor you have done me, animates</LINE>
<LINE>And cheers my green, yet scarce appearing strength</LINE>
<LINE>With comfortable good presaging signs,</LINE>
<LINE>No other wise than did old Jacob&#8217;s words,</LINE>
<LINE>When as he breathed his blessings on his sons.</LINE>
<LINE>These hallowed gifts of yours when I profane,</LINE>
<LINE>Or use them not to glory of my God,</LINE>
<LINE>To patronage the fatherless and poor,</LINE>
<LINE>Or for the benefit of England&#8217;s peace,</LINE>
<LINE>Be numb my joints, wax feeble both mine arms,</LINE>
<LINE>Wither my heart, that, like a sapless tree,</LINE>
<LINE>I may remain the map of infamy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then thus our steeled battles shall be ranged:</LINE>
<LINE>The leading of the vaward, Ned, is thine;</LINE>
<LINE>To dignify whose lusty spirit the more,</LINE>
<LINE>We temper it with Audley&#8217;s gravity,</LINE>
<LINE>That, courage and experience joined in one,</LINE>
<LINE>Your manage may be second unto none:</LINE>
<LINE>For the main battles, I will guide myself;</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Neither, my lord: but narrowly beset</LINE>
<LINE>With turning Frenchmen, whom he did pursue,</LINE>
<LINE>As &#8217;tis impossible that he should scape,</LINE>
<LINE>Except your highness presently descend.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Tut, let him fight; we gave him arms today,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then will he win a world of honor too,</LINE>
<LINE>If he by valour can redeem him thence;</LINE>
<LINE>If not, what remedy? We have more sons</LINE>
<LINE>Than one, to comfort our declining age.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter Audley.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Renowned Edward, give me leave, I pray,</LINE>
<LINE>To lead my soldiers where I may relieve</LINE>
<LINE>Your Grace&#8217;s son, in danger to be slain.</LINE>
<LINE>The snares of French, like emmets on a bank,</LINE>
<LINE>Muster about him; whilest he, lion-like,</LINE>
<LINE>Intangled in the net of their assaults,</LINE>
<LINE>Franticly wrends, and bites the woven toil;</LINE>
<LINE>But all in vain, he cannot free himself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Audley, content; I will not have a man,</LINE>
<LINE>On pain of death, sent forth to succour him:</LINE>
<LINE>This is the day, ordained by destiny,</LINE>
<LINE>To season his courage with those grievous thoughts,</LINE>
<LINE>That, if he breaketh out, Nestor&#8217;s years on earth</LINE>
<LINE>Will make him savor still of this exploit.</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Why, then his epitaph is lasting praise.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUDLEY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yet, good my lord, &#8217;tis too much willfulness,</LINE>
<LINE>To let his blood be spilt, that may be saved.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Exclaim no more; for none of you can tell</LINE>
<LINE>Whether a borrowed aid will serve, or no;</LINE>
<LINE>Perhaps he is already slain or ta&#8217;en.</LINE>
<LINE>And dare a falcon when she&#8217;s in her flight, </LINE>
<LINE>And ever after she&#8217;ll be haggard like:</LINE>
<LINE>Let Edward be delivered by our hands,</LINE>
<LINE>And still, in danger, he&#8217;ll expect the like;</LINE>
<LINE>But if himself himself redeem from thence,</LINE>
<LINE>He will have vanquished cheerful death and fear,</LINE>
<LINE>And ever after dread their force no more</LINE>

<LINE>First having done my duty as beseemed,</LINE>

<LINE>And now, behold, after my winter&#8217;s toil,</LINE>
<LINE>My painful voyage on the boisterous sea</LINE>
<LINE>Of wars devouring gulfs and steely rocks,</LINE>
<LINE>I bring my fraught unto the wished port,</LINE>
<LINE>My summer&#8217;s hope, my travels&#8217; sweet reward:</LINE>
<LINE>And here, with humble duty, I present</LINE>
<LINE>This sacrifice, this first fruit of my sword,</LINE>
<LINE>Cropped and cut down even at the gate of death,</LINE>
<LINE>The king of Boheme, father, whom I slew;</LINE>
<LINE>Whose thousands had entrenched me round about,</LINE>
<LINE>And lay as thick upon my battered crest,</LINE>
<LINE>As on an anvil, with their ponderous glaves:</LINE>
<LINE>Yet marble courage still did underprop</LINE>
<LINE>And when my weary arms, with often blows,</LINE>
<LINE>Like the continual laboring wood-man&#8217;s Axe</LINE>
<LINE>That is enjoined to fell a load of oaks,</LINE>
<LINE>Began to faulter, straight I would record</LINE>
<LINE>My gifts you gave me, and my zealous vow,</LINE>
<LINE>And then new courage made me fresh again,</LINE>
<LINE>That, in despite, I carved my passage forth,</LINE>
<LINE>And put the multitude to speedy flight.</LINE>
<LINE>Lo, thus hath Edward&#8217;s hand filled your request,</LINE>
<LINE>And done, I hope, the duty of a knight.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Aye, well thou hast deserved a knighthood, Ned!</LINE>
<LINE>And, therefore, with thy sword, yet reaking warm</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>His sword borne by a soldier.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>With blood of those that fought to be thy bane.</LINE>
<LINE>Arise, Prince Edward, trusty knight at arms:</LINE>
<LINE>This day thou hast confounded me with joy,</LINE>
<LINE>And proud thyself fit heir unto a king.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here is a note, my gracious lord, of those</LINE>
<LINE>That in this conflict of our foes were slain:</LINE>
<LINE>Eleven princes of esteem, four score barons,</LINE>
<LINE>A hundred and twenty knights, and thirty thousand</LINE>
<LINE>Common soldiers; and, of our men, a thousand.</LINE>

<LINE>Our God be praised! Now, John of France, I hope,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou knowest King Edward for no wantoness,</LINE>

<LINE>But which way is the fearful king escaped?</LINE>

<LINE>And will not ope their gates, and let us in,</LINE>
<LINE>We will entrench ourselves on every side,</LINE>
<LINE>That neither victuals nor supply of men</LINE>
<LINE>May come to succour this accursed town:</LINE>
<LINE>Famine shall combat where our swords are stopped.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>DERBY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The promised aid, that made them stand aloof,</LINE>
<LINE>Is now retired and gone an other way:</LINE>
<LINE>It will repent them of their stubborn will.</LINE>
<LINE>But what are these poor ragged slaves, my lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ask what they are; it seems, they come from Callice.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DERBY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You wretched patterns of despair and woe,</LINE>
<LINE>What are you, living men or gliding ghosts,</LINE>
<LINE>Crept from your graves to walk upon the earth?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No ghosts, my lord, but men that breath a life</LINE>
<LINE>Far worse than is the quiet sleep of death:</LINE>
<LINE>We are distressed poor inhabitants,</LINE>
<LINE>That long have been diseased, sick, and lame;</LINE>
<LINE>And now, because we are not fit to serve,</LINE>
<LINE>The captain of the town hath thrust us forth,</LINE>
<LINE>That so expense of victuals may be saved.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A charitable deed, no doubt, and worthy praise!</LINE>
<LINE>But how do you imagine then to speed?</LINE>
<LINE>We are your enemies; in such a case</LINE>
<LINE>We can no less but put ye to the sword,</LINE>
<LINE>Since, when we proffered truce, it was refused.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And if your grace no otherwise vouchsafe,</LINE>
<LINE>As welcome death is unto us as life.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Poor silly men, much wronged and more distressed!</LINE>
<LINE>Go, Derby, go, and see they be relieved;</LINE>
<LINE>Command that victuals be appointed them,</LINE>
<LINE>And give to every one five crowns a piece.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exeunt Derby and Frenchmen.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>The lion scorns to touch the yielding prey,</LINE>
<LINE>And Edward&#8217;s sword must flesh itself in such</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Lord Percy! Welcome: what&#8217;s the news in England?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PERCY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The Queen, my lord, comes here to your Grace,</LINE>
<LINE>And from her highness and the lord viceregent</LINE>
<LINE>I bring this happy tidings of success:</LINE>
<LINE>David of Scotland, lately up in arms,</LINE>
<LINE>Thinking, belike, he soonest should prevail,</LINE>
<LINE>Your highness being absent from the realm,</LINE>
<LINE>Is, by the fruitful service of your peers</LINE>
<LINE>And painful travel of the Queen herself,</LINE>
<LINE>That, big with child, was every day in arms,</LINE>
<LINE>Vanquished, subdued, and taken prisoner.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thanks, Percy, for thy news, with all my heart!</LINE>
<LINE>What was he took him prisoner in the field?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PERCY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>An esquire, my lord; John Copland is his name:</LINE>
<LINE>Who since, intreated by her Majesty,</LINE>
<LINE>Denies to make surrender of his prize</LINE>
<LINE>To any but unto your grace alone;</LINE>
<LINE>Whereat the Queen is grievously displeas&#8217;d.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, then we&#8217;ll have a Pursiuvant despatched,</LINE>
<LINE>To summon Copland hither out of hand,</LINE>
<LINE>And with him he shall bring his prisoner king.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PERCY.</SPEAKER>

<LINE>To land at Callice, and to visit you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She shall be welcome; and, to wait her coming,</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll pitch my tent near to the sandy shore.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. FR. CAPTAIN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The Burgesses of Callice, mighty king,</LINE>
<LINE>Have by a counsel willingly decreed</LINE>
<LINE>To yield the town and castle to your hands,</LINE>
<LINE>Upon condition it will please your grace</LINE>
<LINE>To grant them benefit of life and goods.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>They will so! Then, belike, they may command,</LINE>
<LINE>Dispose, elect, and govern as they list.</LINE>
<LINE>No, sirra, tell them, since they did refuse</LINE>
<LINE>Our princely clemency at first proclaimed,</LINE>
<LINE>They shall not have it now, although they would;</LINE>
<LINE>I will accept of nought but fire and sword,</LINE>
<LINE>Except, within these two days, six of them,</LINE>
<LINE>That are the wealthiest merchants in the town,</LINE>
<LINE>Come naked, all but for their linen shirts,</LINE>
<LINE>With each a halter hanged about his neck,</LINE>
<LINE>And prostrate yield themselves, upon their knees,</LINE>
<LINE>To be afflicted, hanged, or what I please;</LINE>
<LINE>And so you may inform their masterships.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt Edward and Percy.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAPTAIN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, this it is to trust a broken staff:</LINE>
<LINE>Had we not been persuaded, John our King</LINE>
<LINE>Would with his army have relieved the town,</LINE>
<LINE>We had not stood upon defiance so:</LINE>
<LINE>But now &#8217;tis past that no man can recall,</LINE>
<LINE>And better some do go to wrack them all.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I wonder, Villiers, thou shouldest importune me</LINE>
<LINE>For one that is our deadly enemy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VILLIERS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not for his sake, my gracious lord, so much</LINE>
<LINE>Am I become an earnest advocate,</LINE>
<LINE>As that thereby my ransom will be quit.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thy ransom, man? Why needest thou talk of that?</LINE>
<LINE>Art thou not free? And are not all occasions,</LINE>
<LINE>That happen for advantage of our foes,</LINE>
<LINE>To be accepted of, and stood upon?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VILLIERS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, good my lord, except the same be just;</LINE>
<LINE>For profit must with honor be comixt,</LINE>
<LINE>Or else our actions are but scandalous.</LINE>
<LINE>But, letting pass their intricate objections,</LINE>
<LINE>Wilt please your highness to subscribe, or no?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Villiers, I will not, nor I cannot do it;</LINE>
<LINE>Salisbury shall not have his will so much,</LINE>
<LINE>To claim a passport how it pleaseth himself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VILLIERS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, then I know the extremity, my lord;</LINE>
<LINE>I must return to prison whence I came.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Return? I hope thou wilt not;</LINE>
<LINE>What bird that hath escaped the fowler&#8217;s gin,</LINE>
<LINE>Will not beware how she&#8217;s ensnared again?</LINE>
<LINE>Or, what is he, so senseless and secure,</LINE>
<LINE>That, having hardly past a dangerous gul,</LINE>
<LINE>Will put himself in peril there again?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VILLIERS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ah, but it is mine oath, my gracious lord,</LINE>
<LINE>Which I in conscience may not violate,</LINE>
<LINE>Or else a kingdom should not draw me hence.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thine oath? Why, tat doth bind thee to abide:</LINE>
<LINE>Hast thou not sworn obedience to thy Prince?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VILLIERS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In all things that uprightly he commands:</LINE>
<LINE>But either to persuade or threaten me,</LINE>
<LINE>Not to perform the covenant of my word,</LINE>
<LINE>Is lawless, and I need not to obey.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, is it lawful for a man to kill,</LINE>
<LINE>And not, to break a promise with his foe?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VILLIERS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To kill, my lord, when war is once proclaimed,</LINE>
<LINE>So that our quarrel be for wrongs received,</LINE>
<LINE>No doubt, is lawfully permitted us;</LINE>
<LINE>But in an oath we must be well advised,</LINE>
<LINE>How we do swear, and, when we once have sworn,</LINE>
<LINE>Not to infringe it, though we die therefore:</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore, my lord, as willing I return,</LINE>
<LINE>As if I were to fly to paradise.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Stay, my Villiers; thine honorable min</LINE>
<LINE>Deserves to be eternally admired.</LINE>
<LINE>Thy suit shall be no longer thus deferred:</LINE>
<LINE>Give me the paper, I&#8217;ll subscribe to it;</LINE>
<LINE>And, wheretofore I loved thee as Villiers,</LINE>
<LINE>Hereafter, I&#8217;ll embrace thee as myself.</LINE>
<LINE>Stay, and be still in favor with thy lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VILLIERS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I humbly thank you grace; I must dispatch,</LINE>
<LINE>And send this passport first unto the Earl,</LINE>
<LINE>And then I will attend your highness pleasure.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do so, Villiers;&#8212;and Charles, when he hath need,</LINE>
<LINE>Be such his soldiers, howsoever he speed!</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, Charles, and arm thee; Edward is entrapped,</LINE>
<LINE>The Prince of Wales is fallen into our hands,</LINE>
<LINE>And we have compassed him; he cannot escape.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But will your highness fight today?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What else, my son? He&#8217;s scarce eight thousand strong,</LINE>
<LINE>And we are threescore thousand at the least.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have a prophecy, my gracious lord,</LINE>
<LINE>Wherein is written what success is like</LINE>
<LINE>To happen us in this outrageous war;</LINE>
<LINE>It was delivered me at Cressy&#8217;s field</LINE>
<LINE>By one that is an aged hermit there.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Reads.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE><RECITE>&#8220;When feathered fowl shall make thine army tremble,</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>And flint stones rise and break the battle ray,</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>Then think on him that doth not now dissemble;</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>For that shall be the hapless dreadful day:</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>Yet, in the end, thy foot thou shalt advance</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>As far in England as thy foe in France.&#8221;</RECITE></LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By this it seems we shall be fortunate:</LINE>
<LINE>For as it is impossible that stones</LINE>
<LINE>Should ever rise and break the battle ray,</LINE>
<LINE>Or airy foul make men in arms to quake,</LINE>
<LINE>So is it like, we shall not be subdued:</LINE>
<LINE>Or say this might be true, yet in the end,</LINE>
<LINE>Since he doth promise we shall drive him hence</LINE>
<LINE>And forage their country as they have done ours,</LINE>
<LINE>By this revenge that loss will seem the less.</LINE>
<LINE>But all are frivolous fancies, toys, and dreams:</LINE>
<LINE>Once we are sure we have ensnared the son,</LINE>
<LINE>Catch we the father after how we can.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Prince Edward, Audley, and others.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Audley, the arms of death embrace us round,</LINE>
<LINE>And comfort have we none, save that to die</LINE>
<LINE>We pay sower earnest for a sweeter life.</LINE>
<LINE>At Cressy&#8217;s field out clouds of warlike smoke</LINE>
<LINE>Choked up those French mouths and dissevered them;</LINE>
<LINE>But now their multitudes of millions hide,</LINE>
<LINE>Masking as twere, the beauteous burning sun,</LINE>
<LINE>Leaving no hope to us, but sullen dark</LINE>
<LINE>And eyeless terror of all ending night.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUDLEY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This sudden, mighty, and expedient head</LINE>
<LINE>That they have made, fair prince, is wonderful.</LINE>
<LINE>Before us in the valley lies the king,</LINE>
<LINE>Vantaged with all that heaven and earth can yield;</LINE>
<LINE>His party stronger battled than our whole:</LINE>
<LINE>His son, the braving Duke of Normandy,</LINE>
<LINE>Hath trimmed the mountain on our right hand up</LINE>
<LINE>In shining plate, that now the aspiring hill</LINE>
<LINE>Shews like a silver quarry or an orb,</LINE>
<LINE>Aloft the which the banners, bannarets,</LINE>
<LINE>And new replenished pendants cuff the air</LINE>
<LINE>And beat the winds, that for their gaudiness</LINE>
<LINE>Struggles to kiss them: on our left hand lies</LINE>
<LINE>Phillip, the younger issue of the king,</LINE>
<LINE>Coating the other hill in such array,</LINE>
<LINE>That all his guilded upright pikes do seem</LINE>
<LINE>Straight trees of gold, the pendants leaves;</LINE>
<LINE>And their device of antique heraldry,</LINE>
<LINE>Quartered in colours, seeming sundry fruits,</LINE>
<LINE>Makes it the orchard of the Hesperides:</LINE>
<LINE>Behind us too the hill doth bear his height,</LINE>
<LINE>For like a half-moon, opening but one way,</LINE>
<LINE>It rounds us in; there at our backs are lodged</LINE>
<LINE>The fatal crossbows, and the battle there</LINE>
<LINE>Is governed by the rough Chatillion.</LINE>
<LINE>Then thus it stands: the valley for our flight</LINE>
<LINE>The king binds in; the hills on either hand</LINE>
<LINE>Are proudly royalized by his sons;</LINE>
<LINE>And on the Hill behind stands certain death</LINE>
<LINE>In pay and service with Chatillion.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Death&#8217;s name is much more mighty than his deeds;</LINE>
<LINE>Thy parcelling this power hath made it more.</LINE>
<LINE>As many sands as these my hands can hold,</LINE>
<LINE>Are but my handful of so many sands;</LINE>
<LINE>Then, all the world, and call it but a power,</LINE>
<LINE>Easily ta&#8217;en up, and quickly thrown away:</LINE>
<LINE>But if I stand to count them sand by sand,</LINE>
<LINE>The number would confound my memory,</LINE>
<LINE>And make a thousand millions of a task,</LINE>
<LINE>Which briefly is no more, indeed, than one.</LINE>
<LINE>These quarters, squadrons, and these regiments,</LINE>
<LINE>Before, behind us, and on either hand,</LINE>
<LINE>Are but a power. When we name a man,</LINE>
<LINE>His hand, his foot, his head hath several strengths;</LINE>
<LINE>And being all but one self instant strength,</LINE>
<LINE>Why, all this many, Audley, is but one,</LINE>
<LINE>And we can call it all but one man&#8217;s strength.</LINE>
<LINE>He that hath far to go, tells it by miles;</LINE>
<LINE>If he should tell the steps, it kills his heart:</LINE>
<LINE>The drops are infinite, that make a flood,</LINE>
<LINE>And yet, thou knowest, we call it but a Rain.</LINE>
<LINE>There is but one France, one King of France,</LINE>
<LINE>That France hath no more kings; and that same King</LINE>
<LINE>Hath but the puissant legion of one king,</LINE>
<LINE>And we have one: then apprehend no odds,</LINE>
<LINE>For one to one is fair equality.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HERALD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The King of France, my sovereign lord and master,</LINE>
<LINE>Greets by me his foe, the Prince of Wales:</LINE>
<LINE>If thou call forth a hundred men of name,</LINE>
<LINE>Of lords, knights, squires, and English gentlemen,</LINE>
<LINE>And with thyself and those kneel at his feet,</LINE>
<LINE>He straight will fold his bloody colours up,</LINE>
<LINE>And ransom shall redeem lives forfeited;</LINE>
<LINE>If not, this day shall drink more English blood,</LINE>
<LINE>Than ere was buried in our British earth.</LINE>
<LINE>What is the answer to his proffered mercy?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This heaven, that covers France, contains the mercy</LINE>
<LINE>That draws from me submissive orizons;</LINE>
<LINE>That such base breath should vanish from my lips,</LINE>
<LINE>To urge the plea of mercy to a man,</LINE>
<LINE>The lord forbid! Return, and tell the king,</LINE>
<LINE>My tongue is made of steel, and it shall beg</LINE>
<LINE>My mercy on his coward burgonet;</LINE>
<LINE>Tell him, my colours are as red as his,</LINE>
<LINE>My men as bold, our English arms as strong:</LINE>
<LINE>Return him my defiance in his face.</LINE>

<LINE>Pitying thy youth is so ingirt with peril,</LINE>

<LINE>As swift as ever yet thou didst bestride,</LINE>
<LINE>And therewithall he counsels thee to fly;</LINE>
<LINE>Else death himself hath sworn that thou shalt die.</LINE>

<LINE>Back with the beast unto the beast that sent him!</LINE>
<LINE>Tell him I cannot sit a coward&#8217;s horse;</LINE>
<LINE>Bid him today bestride the jade himself,</LINE>
<LINE>For I will stain my horse quite o&#8217;er with blood,</LINE>
<LINE>And double gild my spurs, but I will catch him;</LINE>

<LINE>Edward of Wales, Phillip, the second son</LINE>
<LINE>To the most mighty christian king of France,</LINE>
<LINE>Seeing thy body&#8217;s living date expired,</LINE>
<LINE>All full of charity and christian love,</LINE>
<LINE>Commends this book, full fraught with prayers,</LINE>
<LINE>To thy fair hand and for thy hour of life</LINE>
<LINE>Intreats thee that thou meditate therein,</LINE>
<LINE>And arm thy soul for her long journey towards&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Thus have I done his bidding, and return.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Herald of Phillip, greet thy lord from me:</LINE>
<LINE>All good that he can send, I can receive;</LINE>
<LINE>But thinkst thou not, the unadvised boy</LINE>
<LINE>Hath wronged himself in thus far tendering me?</LINE>
<LINE>Happily he cannot pray without the book&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>I think him no divine extemporall&#8212;,</LINE>
<LINE>Then render back this common place of prayer,</LINE>
<LINE>To do himself good in adversity;</LINE>
<LINE>Beside he knows not my sins&#8217; quality,</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore knows no prayers for my avail;</LINE>
<LINE>Ere night his prayer may be to pray to God,</LINE>
<LINE>To put it in my heart to hear his prayer.</LINE>
<LINE>So tell the courtly wanton, and be gone.</LINE>

<LINE>How confident their strength and number makes them!&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Now, Audley, sound those silver wings of thine,</LINE>
<LINE>And let those milk white messengers of time</LINE>
<LINE>Shew thy times learning in this dangerous time.</LINE>
<LINE>Thy self art bruis&#8217;d and bit with many broils,</LINE>
<LINE>And stratagems forepast with iron pens</LINE>
<LINE>Are texted in thine honorable face;</LINE>
<LINE>Thou art a married man in this distress,</LINE>
<LINE>But danger woos me as a blushing maid:</LINE>
<LINE>Teach me an answer to this perilous time.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUDLEY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To die is all as common as to live:</LINE>
<LINE>The one ince-wise, the other holds in chase;</LINE>
<LINE>For, from the instant we begin to live,</LINE>
<LINE>We do pursue and hunt the time to die:</LINE>
<LINE>First bud we, then we blow, and after seed,</LINE>
<LINE>Then, presently, we fall; and, as a shade</LINE>
<LINE>Follows the body, so we follow death.</LINE>
<LINE>If, then, we hunt for death, why do we fear it?</LINE>
<LINE>If we fear it, why do we follow it?</LINE>
<LINE>If we do fear, how can we shun it?</LINE>
<LINE>If we do fear, with fear we do but aide</LINE>
<LINE>The thing we fear to seize on us the sooner:</LINE>
<LINE>If we fear not, then no resolved proffer</LINE>
<LINE>Can overthrow the limit of our fate;</LINE>
<LINE>For, whether ripe or rotten, drop we shall,</LINE>
<LINE>As we do draw the lottery of our doom.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ah, good old man, a thousand thousand armors</LINE>
<LINE>These words of thine have buckled on my back:</LINE>
<LINE>Ah, what an idiot hast thou made of life,</LINE>
<LINE>To seek the thing it fears! And how disgraced</LINE>
<LINE>The imperial victory of murdering death,</LINE>
<LINE>Since all the lives his conquering arrows strike</LINE>
<LINE>Seek him, and he not them, to shame his glory!</LINE>
<LINE>I will not give a penny for a life,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor half a halfpenny to shun grim death,</LINE>
<LINE>Since for to live is but to seek to die,</LINE>
<LINE>And dying but beginning of new life.</LINE>
<LINE>Let come the hour when he that rules it will!</LINE>
<LINE>To live or die I hold indifferent.</LINE>

<LINE>A sudden darkness hath defaced the sky,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here comes my brother Phillip.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">All dismayed:</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Phillip.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>What fearful words are those thy looks presage?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PHILLIP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A flight, a flight!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Coward, what flight? Thou liest, there needs no flight.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PHILLIP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A flight.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Awake thy craven powers, and tell on</LINE>
<LINE>The substance of that very fear indeed,</LINE>
<LINE>Which is so ghastly printed in thy face:</LINE>
<LINE>What is the matter?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PHILLIP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A flight of ugly ravens</LINE>
<LINE>Do croak and hover o&#8217;er our soldiers&#8217; heads,</LINE>
<LINE>And keep in triangles and cornered squares,</LINE>
<LINE>Right as our forces are embattled;</LINE>
<LINE>With their approach there came this sudden fog,</LINE>
<LINE>Which now hath hid the airy floor of heaven</LINE>
<LINE>And made at noon a night unnatural</LINE>
<LINE>Upon the quaking and dismayed world:</LINE>
<LINE>In brief, our soldiers have let fall their arms,</LINE>
<LINE>And stand like metamorphosed images,</LINE>
<LINE>Bloodless and pale, one gazing on another.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Aye, now I call to mind the prophecy,</LINE>
<LINE>But I must give no entrance to a fear.&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Return, and hearten up these yielding souls:</LINE>
<LINE>Tell them, the ravens, seeing them in arms,</LINE>
<LINE>So many fair against a famished few,</LINE>
<LINE>Come but to dine upon their handy work</LINE>
<LINE>And prey upon the carrion that they kill:</LINE>
<LINE>For when we see a horse laid down to die,</LINE>
<LINE>Although he be not dead, the ravenous birds</LINE>
<LINE>Sit watching the departure of his life;</LINE>
<LINE>Even so these ravens for the carcasses</LINE>
<LINE>Of those poor English, that are marked to die,</LINE>
<LINE>Hover about, and, if they cry to us,</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis but for meat that we must kill for them.</LINE>
<LINE>Away, and comfort up my soldiers,</LINE>
<LINE>And sound the trumpets, and at once dispatch</LINE>
<LINE>This little business of a silly fraud.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit Phillip.</STAGEDIR>

<STAGEDIR>Another noise. Salisbury brought in by the Second French Captain.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. FR. CAPTAIN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Behold, my liege, this knight and forty mo,</LINE>
<LINE>Of whom the better part are slain and fled,</LINE>
<LINE>With all endeavor sought to break our ranks,</LINE>
<LINE>And make their way to the encompassed prince:</LINE>
<LINE>Dispose of him as please your majesty.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go, and the next bough, soldier, that thou seest,</LINE>
<LINE>Disgrace it with his body presently;</LINE>
<LINE>For I do hold a tree in France too good</LINE>
<LINE>To be the gallows of an English thief.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SALISBURY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord of Normandy, I have your pass</LINE>
<LINE>And warrant for my safety through this land.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Villiers procured it for thee, did he not?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SALISBURY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He did.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And it is current; thou shalt freely pass.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Aye, freely to the gallows to be hanged,</LINE>
<LINE>Without denial or impediment.</LINE>
<LINE>Away with him!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I hope your highness will not so disgrace me,</LINE>
<LINE>And dash the virtue of my seal at arms:</LINE>
<LINE>He hath my never broken name to shew,</LINE>
<LINE>Charactered with this princely hand of mine:</LINE>
<LINE>And rather let me leave to be a prince</LINE>
<LINE>Than break the stable verdict of a prince:</LINE>
<LINE>I do beseech you, let him pass in quiet.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou and thy word lie both in my command:</LINE>
<LINE>What canst thou promise that I cannot break?</LINE>
<LINE>Which of these twain is greater infamy,</LINE>
<LINE>To disobey thy father or thyself?</LINE>
<LINE>Thy word, nor no mans, may exceed his power;</LINE>
<LINE>Nor that same man doth never break his word,</LINE>
<LINE>That keeps it to the utmost of his power.</LINE>
<LINE>The breach of faith dwells in the soul&#8217;s consent:</LINE>
<LINE>Which if thyself without consent do break,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou art not charged with the breach of faith.</LINE>
<LINE>Go, hang him: for thy license lies in me,</LINE>
<LINE>And my constraint stands the excuse for thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, am I not a soldier in my word?</LINE>
<LINE>Then, arms, <FRENCH lang="fr">adieu</FRENCH>, and let them fight that list!</LINE>
<LINE>Shall I not give my girdle from my waste,</LINE>
<LINE>But with a gardion I shall be controlled,</LINE>
<LINE>To say I may not give my things away?</LINE>
<LINE>Upon my soul, had Edward, prince of Wales,</LINE>
<LINE>Engaged his word, writ down his noble hand</LINE>
<LINE>For all your knights to pass his father&#8217;s land,</LINE>
<LINE>The royal king, to grace his warlike son,</LINE>
<LINE>Would not alone safe conduct give to them,</LINE>
<LINE>But with all bounty feasted them and theirs.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Dwell&#8217;st thou on precedents? Then be it so!</LINE>
<LINE>Say, Englishman, of what degree thou art.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SALISBURY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>An Earl in England, though a prisoner here,</LINE>
<LINE>And those that know me, call me Salisbury.</LINE>

<LINE>Then, Salisbury, say whether thou art bound.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SALISBURY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To Callice, where my liege, King Edward, is.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To Callice, Salisbury? Then, to Callice pack,</LINE>
<LINE>And bid the king prepare a noble grave,</LINE>
<LINE>To put his princely son, black Edward, in.</LINE>
<LINE>And as thou travelst westward from this place,</LINE>
<LINE>Some two leagues hence there is a lofty hill,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose top seems topless, for the embracing sky</LINE>
<LINE>Doth hide his high head in her azure bosom;</LINE>
<LINE>Upon whose tall top when thy foot attains,</LINE>
<LINE>Look back upon the humble vale beneath&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Humble of late, but now made proud with arms&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>And thence behold the wretched prince of Wales,</LINE>
<LINE>Hooped with a bond of iron round about.</LINE>
<LINE>After which sight, to Callice spur amain,</LINE>
<LINE>And say, the prince was smothered and not slain:</LINE>
<LINE>And tell the king this is not all his ill;</LINE>
<LINE>For I will greet him, ere he thinks I will.</LINE>
<LINE>Away, be gone; the smoke but of our shot</LINE>
<LINE>Will choke our foes, though bullets hit them not.</LINE>

<LINE>Are now the subjects of my clemency.</LINE>
<LINE>Fie, lords! Is it not a shame that English boys,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose early days are yet not worth a beard,</LINE>
<LINE>Should in the bosom of your kingdom thus,</LINE>
<LINE>One against twenty, beat you up together?</LINE>

<LINE>Speak, thou that wooest death with thy careless smile,</LINE>
<LINE>And lookst so merrily upon thy grave,</LINE>

<LINE>Dear Audley, if my tongue ring out thy end,</LINE>
<LINE>My arms shall be thy grave: what may I do</LINE>
<LINE>To win thy life, or to revenge thy death?</LINE>
<LINE>If thou wilt drink the blood of captive kings,</LINE>
<LINE>Or that it were restorative, command</LINE>
<LINE>A health of kings&#8217; blood, and I&#8217;ll drink to thee;</LINE>
<LINE>If honor may dispense for thee with death,</LINE>

<LINE>If I could hold him death but at a bay,</LINE>
<LINE>Till I did see my liege thy royal father,</LINE>
<LINE>My soul should yield this castle of my flesh,</LINE>

<LINE>But to his person I will bend my knee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I pray thee, Phillip, let displeasure pass;</LINE>
<LINE>This man doth please me, and I like his words:</LINE>
<LINE>For what is he that will attempt great deeds,</LINE>
<LINE>And lose the glory that ensues the same?</LINE>
<LINE>All rivers have recourse unto the sea,</LINE>
<LINE>And Copland&#8217;s faith relation to his king.</LINE>
<LINE>Kneel, therefore, down: now rise, king Edward&#8217;s knight;</LINE>
<LINE>And, to maintain thy state, I freely give</LINE>
<LINE>Five hundred marks a year to thee and thine.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter Salisbury.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Welcome, lord Salisbury: what news from Britain?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SALISBURY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This, mighty king: the country we have won,</LINE>
<LINE>And John de Mountford, regent of that place,</LINE>
<LINE>Presents your highness with this coronet,</LINE>
<LINE>Protesting true allegiance to your Grace.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We thank thee for thy service, valiant Earl;</LINE>
<LINE>Challenge our favor, for we owe it thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SALISBURY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But now, my lord, as this is joyful news,</LINE>
<LINE>So must my voice be tragical again,</LINE>
<LINE>And I must sing of doleful accidents.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, have our men the overthrow at Poictiers?</LINE>
<LINE>Or is our son beset with too much odds?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SALISBURY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He was, my lord: and as my worthless self</LINE>
<LINE>With forty other serviceable knights,</LINE>
<LINE>Under safe conduct of the Dauphin&#8217;s seal,</LINE>
<LINE>Did travail that way, finding him distressed,</LINE>
<LINE>A troop of lances met us on the way,</LINE>
<LINE>Surprised, and brought us prisoners to the king,</LINE>
<LINE>Who, proud of this, and eager of revenge,</LINE>
<LINE>Commanded straight to cut off all our heads:</LINE>
<LINE>And surely we had died, but that the Duke,</LINE>
<LINE>More full of honor than his angry sire,</LINE>
<LINE>Procured our quick deliverance from thence;</LINE>
<LINE>But, ere we went, &#8220;Salute your king,&#8221; quoth he,</LINE>
<LINE>&#8220;Bid him provide a funeral for his son:</LINE>
<LINE>To day our sword shall cut his thread of life;</LINE>
<LINE>And, sooner than he thinks, we&#8217;ll be with him,</LINE>
<LINE>To quittance those displeasures he hath done.&#8221;</LINE>
<LINE>This said, we past, not daring to reply;</LINE>
<LINE>Our hearts were dead, our looks diffused and wan.</LINE>
<LINE>Wandering, at last we climed unto a hill,</LINE>
<LINE>From whence, although our grief were much before,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet now to see the occasion with our eyes</LINE>
<LINE>Did thrice so much increase our heaviness:</LINE>
<LINE>For there, my lord, oh, there we did descry</LINE>
<LINE>Down in a valley how both armies lay.</LINE>
<LINE>The French had cast their trenches like a ring,</LINE>
<LINE>And every barricado&#8217;s open front</LINE>
<LINE>Was thick embossed with brazen ordinance;</LINE>
<LINE>Here stood a battaile of ten thousand horse,</LINE>
<LINE>There twice as many pikes in quadrant wise,</LINE>
<LINE>Here crossbows, and deadly wounding darts:</LINE>
<LINE>And in the midst, like to a slender point</LINE>
<LINE>Within the compass of the horizon,</LINE>
<LINE>(As twere a rising bubble in the sea,</LINE>
<LINE>A hazle wand amidst a wood of pines,</LINE>
<LINE>Or as a bear fast chained unto a stake),</LINE>
<LINE>Stood famous Edward, still expecting when</LINE>
<LINE>Those dogs of France would fasten on his flesh.</LINE>
<LINE>Anon the death procuring knell begins:</LINE>
<LINE>Off go the cannons, that with trembling noise</LINE>
<LINE>Did shake the very mountain where they stood;</LINE>
<LINE>Then sound the trumpets&#8217; clangor in the air,</LINE>
<LINE>The battles join: and, when we could no more</LINE>
<LINE>Discern the difference twixt the friend and foe,</LINE>
<LINE>So intricate the dark confusion was,</LINE>
<LINE>Away we turned our watery eyes with sighs,</LINE>
<LINE>As black as powder fuming into smoke.</LINE>
<LINE>And thus, I fear, unhappy have I told</LINE>
<LINE>The most untimely tale of Edward&#8217;s fall.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN PHILLIP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ah me, is this my welcome into France?</LINE>
<LINE>Is this the comfort that I looked to have,</LINE>
<LINE>When I should meet with my beloved son?</LINE>
<LINE>Sweet Ned, I would thy mother in the sea</LINE>
<LINE>Had been prevented of this mortal grief!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Content thee, Phillip; &#8217;tis not tears will serve</LINE>
<LINE>To call him back, if he be taken hence:</LINE>
<LINE>Comfort thyself, as I do, gentle Queen,</LINE>
<LINE>With hope of sharp, unheard of, dire revenge.&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>He bids me to provide his funeral,</LINE>
<LINE>And so I will; but all the peers in France</LINE>
<LINE>Shall mourners be, and weep out bloody tears,</LINE>
<LINE>Until their empty veins be dry and sere:</LINE>
<LINE>The pillars of his hearse shall be his bones;</LINE>
<LINE>The mould that covers him, their city ashes;</LINE>
<LINE>His knell, the groaning cries of dying men;</LINE>
<LINE>And, in the stead of tapers on his tomb,</LINE>
<LINE>An hundred fifty towers shall burning blaze,</LINE>
<LINE>While we bewail our valiant son&#8217;s decease.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>After a flourish, sounded within, enter an English Herald.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ENG. HERALD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Rejoice, my lord; ascend the imperial throne!</LINE>
<LINE>The mighty and redoubted prince of Wales,</LINE>
<LINE>Great servitor to bloody Mars in arms,</LINE>
<LINE>The Frenchman&#8217;s terror, and his country&#8217;s fame,</LINE>
<LINE>Triumphant rideth like a Roman peer,</LINE>
<LINE>And, lowly at his stirrup, comes afoot</LINE>
<LINE>King John of France, together with his son,</LINE>
<LINE>In captive bonds; whose diadem he brings</LINE>
<LINE>To crown thee with, and to proclaim thee king.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Away with mourning, Phillip, wipe thine eyes;&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Sound, trumpets, welcome in Plantagenet!</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter Prince Edward, King John, Phillip, Audley, Artois.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>As things long lost, when they are found again,</LINE>
<LINE>So doth my son rejoice his father&#8217;s heart,</LINE>
<LINE>For whom even now my soul was much perplexed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN PHILLIP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Be this a token to express my joy,</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Kisses him.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>For inward passion will not let me speak.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My gracious father, here receive the gift.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Presenting him with King John&#8217;s crown.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>This wreath of conquest and reward of war,</LINE>
<LINE>Got with as mickle peril of our lives,</LINE>
<LINE>As ere was thing of price before this day;</LINE>
<LINE>Install your highness in your proper right:</LINE>
<LINE>And, herewithall, I render to your hands</LINE>
<LINE>These prisoners, chief occasion of our strife.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So, John of France, I see you keep your word:</LINE>
<LINE>You promised to be sooner with our self</LINE>
<LINE>Than we did think for, and &#8217;tis so indeed:</LINE>
<LINE>But, had you done at first as now you do,</LINE>
<LINE>How many civil towns had stood untouched,</LINE>
<LINE>That now are turned to ragged heaps of stones!</LINE>
<LINE>How many people&#8217;s lives mightst thou have saved,</LINE>
<LINE>That are untimely sunk into their graves!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Edward, recount not things irrevocable;</LINE>
<LINE>Tell me what ransom thou requirest to have.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thy ransom, John, hereafter shall be known:</LINE>
<LINE>But first to England thou must cross the seas,</LINE>
<LINE>To see what entertainment it affords;</LINE>
<LINE>How ere it falls, it cannot be so bad,</LINE>
<LINE>As ours hath been since we arrived in France.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Accursed man! Of this I was foretold,</LINE>
<LINE>But did misconster what the prophet told.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, father, this petition Edward makes</LINE>
<LINE>To thee, whose grace hath been his strongest shield,</LINE>
<LINE>That, as thy pleasure chose me for the man</LINE>
<LINE>To be the instrument to shew thy power,</LINE>
<LINE>So thou wilt grant that many princes more,</LINE>
<LINE>Bred and brought up within that little Isle,</LINE>
<LINE>May still be famous for like victories!</LINE>
<LINE>And, for my part, the bloody scars I bear,</LINE>
<LINE>And weary nights that I have watched in field,</LINE>
<LINE>The dangerous conflicts I have often had,</LINE>
<LINE>The fearful menaces were proffered me,</LINE>
<LINE>The heat and cold and what else might displease:</LINE>
<LINE>I wish were now redoubled twenty fold,</LINE>
<LINE>So that hereafter ages, when they read</LINE>
<LINE>The painful traffic of my tender youth,</LINE>
<LINE>Might thereby be inflamed with such resolve,</LINE>
<LINE>As not the territories of France alone,</LINE>
<LINE>But likewise Spain, Turkey, and what countries else</LINE>
<LINE>That justly would provoke fair England&#8217;s ire,</LINE>
<LINE>Might, at their presence, tremble and retire.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING EDWARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here, English lords, we do proclaim a rest,</LINE>
<LINE>An intercession of our painful arms:</LINE>
<LINE>Sheath up your swords, refresh your weary limbs,</LINE>
<LINE>Peruse your spoils; and, after we have breathed</LINE>
<LINE>A day or two within this haven town,</LINE>
<LINE>God willing, then for England we&#8217;ll be shipped;</LINE>
<LINE>Where, in a happy hour, I trust, we shall</LINE>
<LINE>Arrive, three kings, two princes, and a queen.</LINE>
</SPEECH>
