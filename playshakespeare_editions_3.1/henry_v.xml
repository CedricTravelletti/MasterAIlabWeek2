<LINE>O for a Muse of fire, that would ascend</LINE>
<LINE>The brightest heaven of invention!</LINE>
<LINE>A kingdom for a stage, princes to act,</LINE>
<LINE>And monarchs to behold the swelling scene!</LINE>
<LINE>Then should the warlike Harry, like himself,</LINE>
<LINE>Assume the port of Mars, and at his heels</LINE>
<LINE>(Leash&#8217;d in, like hounds) should famine, sword, and fire</LINE>
<LINE>Crouch for employment. But pardon, gentles all,</LINE>
<LINE>The flat unraised spirits that hath dar&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>On this unworthy scaffold to bring forth</LINE>
<LINE>So great an object. Can this cockpit hold</LINE>
<LINE>The vasty fields of France? Or may we cram</LINE>
<LINE>Within this wooden O the very casques</LINE>
<LINE>That did affright the air at Agincourt?</LINE>
<LINE>O, pardon! Since a crooked figure may</LINE>
<LINE>Attest in little place a million,</LINE>
<LINE>And let us, ciphers to this great accompt,</LINE>
<LINE>On your imaginary forces work.</LINE>
<LINE>Suppose within the girdle of these walls</LINE>
<LINE>Are now confin&#8217;d two mighty monarchies,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose high, upreared, and abutting fronts</LINE>
<LINE>The perilous narrow ocean parts asunder.</LINE>
<LINE>Piece out our imperfections with your thoughts;</LINE>
<LINE>Into a thousand parts divide one man,</LINE>
<LINE>And make imaginary puissance;</LINE>
<LINE>Think, when we talk of horses, that you see them</LINE>
<LINE>Printing their proud hoofs i&#8217; th&#8217; receiving earth;</LINE>
<LINE>For &#8217;tis your thoughts that now must deck our kings,</LINE>
<LINE>Carry them here and there, jumping o&#8217;er times,</LINE>

<SCENELOCATION>London. An ante-chamber in the King&#8217;s palace.</SCENELOCATION>
<SCENEPERSONAE>(Archbishop of Canterbury, Bishop of Ely)</SCENEPERSONAE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter the two Bishops, the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishop of Ely.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, I&#8217;ll tell you, that self bill is urg&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>Which in th&#8217; eleventh year of the last king&#8217;s reign</LINE>
<LINE>Was like, and had indeed against us pass&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>But that the scambling and unquiet time</LINE>
<LINE>Did push it out of farther question.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ELY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But how, my lord, shall we resist it now?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It must be thought on. If it pass against us,</LINE>
<LINE>We lose the better half of our possession;</LINE>
<LINE>For all the temporal lands, which men devout</LINE>
<LINE>By testament have given to the Church,</LINE>
<LINE>Would they strip from us; being valu&#8217;d thus:</LINE>
<LINE>As much as would maintain, to the King&#8217;s honor,</LINE>
<LINE>Full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights,</LINE>
<LINE>Six thousand and two hundred good esquires;</LINE>
<LINE>And to relief of lazars, and weak age</LINE>
<LINE>Of indigent faint souls past corporal toil,</LINE>
<LINE>A hundred almshouses right well supplied;</LINE>
<LINE>And to the coffers of the King beside,</LINE>
<LINE>A thousand pounds by th&#8217; year. Thus runs the bill.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ELY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This would drink deep.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">&#8217;Twould drink the cup and all.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ELY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But what prevention?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The King is full of grace and fair regard.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ELY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And a true lover of the holy Church.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The courses of his youth promis&#8217;d it not.</LINE>
<LINE>The breath no sooner left his father&#8217;s body,</LINE>
<LINE>But that his wildness, mortified in him,</LINE>
<LINE>Seem&#8217;d to die too; yea, at that very moment,</LINE>
<LINE>Consideration like an angel came</LINE>
<LINE>And whipt th&#8217; offending Adam out of him,</LINE>
<LINE>Leaving his body as a paradise</LINE>
<LINE>T&#8217; envelop and contain celestial spirits.</LINE>
<LINE>Never was such a sudden scholar made;</LINE>
<LINE>Never came reformation in a flood</LINE>
<LINE>With such a heady currance, scouring faults;</LINE>
<LINE>Nor never Hydra-headed willfulness</LINE>
<LINE>So soon did lose his seat (and all at once)</LINE>
<LINE>As in this king.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ELY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="3">We are blessed in the change.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hear him but reason in divinity,</LINE>
<LINE>And all-admiring, with an inward wish</LINE>
<LINE>You would desire the King were made a prelate;</LINE>
<LINE>Hear him debate of commonwealth affairs,</LINE>
<LINE>You would say it hath been all in all his study;</LINE>
<LINE>List his discourse of war, and you shall hear</LINE>
<LINE>A fearful battle rend&#8217;red you in music;</LINE>
<LINE>Turn him to any cause of policy,</LINE>
<LINE>The Gordian knot of it he will unloose,</LINE>
<LINE>Familiar as his garter; that, when he speaks,</LINE>
<LINE>The air, a charter&#8217;d libertine, is still,</LINE>
<LINE>And the mute wonder lurketh in men&#8217;s ears</LINE>
<LINE>To steal his sweet and honeyed sentences;</LINE>
<LINE>So that the art and practic part of life</LINE>
<LINE>Must be the mistress to this theoric;</LINE>
<LINE>Which is a wonder how his Grace should glean it,</LINE>
<LINE>Since his addiction was to courses vain,</LINE>
<LINE>His companies unletter&#8217;d, rude, and shallow,</LINE>
<LINE>His hours fill&#8217;d up with riots, banquets, sports;</LINE>
<LINE>And never noted in him any study,</LINE>
<LINE>Any retirement, any sequestration</LINE>
<LINE>From open haunts and popularity.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ELY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The strawberry grows underneath the nettle,</LINE>
<LINE>And wholesome berries thrive and ripen best</LINE>
<LINE>Neighbor&#8217;d by fruit of baser quality;</LINE>
<LINE>And so the Prince obscur&#8217;d his contemplation</LINE>
<LINE>Under the veil of wildness, which (no doubt)</LINE>
<LINE>Grew like the summer grass, fastest by night,</LINE>
<LINE>Unseen, yet crescive in his faculty.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It must be so; for miracles are ceas&#8217;d;</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore we must needs admit the means</LINE>
<LINE>How things are perfected.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ELY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">But, my good lord,</LINE>
<LINE>How now for mitigation of this bill</LINE>
<LINE>Urg&#8217;d by the commons? Doth his Majesty</LINE>
<LINE>Incline to it, or no?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">He seems indifferent;</LINE>
<LINE>Or rather swaying more upon our part</LINE>
<LINE>Than cherishing th&#8217; exhibitors against us;</LINE>
<LINE>For I have made an offer to his Majesty,</LINE>
<LINE>Upon our spiritual convocation</LINE>
<LINE>And in regard of causes now in hand,</LINE>
<LINE>Which I have open&#8217;d to his Grace at large,</LINE>
<LINE>As touching France, to give a greater sum</LINE>
<LINE>Than ever at one time the clergy yet</LINE>
<LINE>Did to his predecessors part withal.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ELY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How did this offer seem receiv&#8217;d, my lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>With good acceptance of his Majesty;</LINE>
<LINE>Save that there was not time enough to hear,</LINE>
<LINE>As I perceiv&#8217;d his Grace would fain have done,</LINE>
<LINE>The severals and unhidden passages</LINE>
<LINE>Of his true titles to some certain dukedoms,</LINE>
<LINE>And generally to the crown and seat of France,</LINE>
<LINE>Deriv&#8217;d from Edward, his great-grandfather.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ELY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What was th&#8217; impediment that broke this off?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The French embassador upon that instant</LINE>
<LINE>Crav&#8217;d audience; and the hour, I think, is come</LINE>
<LINE>To give him hearing. Is it four a&#8217; clock?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ELY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then go we in, to know his embassy;</LINE>
<LINE>Which I could with a ready guess declare,</LINE>
<LINE>Before the Frenchman speak a word of it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ELY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll wait upon you, and I long to hear it.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter the King, Humphrey Duke of Gloucester, Bedford, Clarence, Warwick, Westmorland, and Exeter, and other Attendants.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. HEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Where is my gracious Lord of Canterbury?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EXE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not here in presence.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. HEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Send for him, good uncle.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WEST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Shall we call in th&#8217; ambassador, my liege?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. HEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not yet, my cousin. We would be resolv&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Before we hear him, of some things of weight</LINE>
<LINE>That task our thoughts, concerning us and France.</LINE>
</SPEECH>
<STAGEDIR>Enter two Bishops, the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishop of Ely.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>God and his angels guard your sacred throne,</LINE>
<LINE>And make you long become it!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. HEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">Sure we thank you.</LINE>
<LINE>My learned lord, we pray you to proceed,</LINE>
<LINE>And justly and religiously unfold</LINE>
<LINE>Why the law Salique, that they have in France,</LINE>
<LINE>Or should, or should not, bar us in our claim;</LINE>
<LINE>And God forbid, my dear and faithful lord,</LINE>
<LINE>That you should fashion, wrest, or bow your reading,</LINE>
<LINE>Or nicely charge your understanding soul</LINE>
<LINE>With opening titles miscreate, whose right</LINE>
<LINE>Suits not in native colors with the truth;</LINE>
<LINE>For God doth know how many now in health</LINE>
<LINE>Shall drop their blood in approbation</LINE>
<LINE>Of what your reverence shall incite us to.</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore take heed how you impawn our person,</LINE>
<LINE>How you awake our sleeping sword of war&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>We charge you, in the name of God, take heed;</LINE>
<LINE>For never two such kingdoms did contend</LINE>
<LINE>Without much fall of blood, whose guiltless drops</LINE>
<LINE>Are every one a woe, a sore complaint,</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Gainst him whose wrongs gives edge unto the swords</LINE>
<LINE>That makes such waste in brief mortality.</LINE>
<LINE>Under this conjuration speak, my lord;</LINE>
<LINE>For we will hear, note, and believe in heart,</LINE>
<LINE>That what you speak is in your conscience wash&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>As pure as sin with baptism.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then hear me, gracious sovereign, and you peers,</LINE>
<LINE>That owe yourselves, your lives, and services</LINE>
<LINE>To this imperial throne. There is no bar</LINE>
<LINE>To make against your Highness&#8217; claim to France</LINE>
<LINE>But this, which they produce from Pharamond:</LINE>
<LINE>&#8220;In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant,&#8221;</LINE>
<LINE>&#8220;No woman shall succeed in Salique land&#8221;;</LINE>
<LINE>Which Salique land the French unjustly gloze</LINE>
<LINE>To be the realm of France, and Pharamond</LINE>
<LINE>The founder of this law and female bar.</LINE>
<LINE>Yet their own authors faithfully affirm</LINE>
<LINE>That the land Salique is in Germany,</LINE>
<LINE>Between the floods of Sala and of Elbe;</LINE>
<LINE>Where Charles the Great, having subdu&#8217;d the Saxons,</LINE>
<LINE>There left behind and settled certain French;</LINE>
<LINE>Who holding in disdain the German women</LINE>
<LINE>For some dishonest manners of their life,</LINE>
<LINE>Establish&#8217;d then this law: to wit, no female</LINE>
<LINE>Should be inheritrix in Salique land;</LINE>
<LINE>Which Salique, as I said, &#8217;twixt Elbe and Sala,</LINE>
<LINE>Is at this day in Germany call&#8217;d Meisen.</LINE>
<LINE>Then doth it well appear the Salique law</LINE>
<LINE>Was not devised for the realm of France;</LINE>
<LINE>Nor did the French possess the Salique land</LINE>
<LINE>Until four hundred one and twenty years</LINE>
<LINE>After defunction of King Pharamond,</LINE>
<LINE>Idly suppos&#8217;d the founder of this law,</LINE>
<LINE>Who died within the year of our redemption</LINE>
<LINE>Four hundred twenty-six; and Charles the Great</LINE>
<LINE>Subdu&#8217;d the Saxons, and did seat the French</LINE>
<LINE>Beyond the river Sala, in the year</LINE>
<LINE>Eight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,</LINE>
<LINE>King Pepin, which deposed Childeric,</LINE>
<LINE>Did, as heir general, being descended</LINE>
<LINE>Of Blithild, which was daughter to King Clothair,</LINE>
<LINE>Make claim and title to the crown of France.</LINE>
<LINE>Hugh Capet also, who usurp&#8217;d the crown</LINE>
<LINE>Of Charles the Duke of Lorraine, sole heir male</LINE>
<LINE>Of the true line and stock of Charles the Great,</LINE>
<LINE>To fine his title with some shows of truth,</LINE>
<LINE>Though in pure truth it was corrupt and naught,</LINE>
<LINE>Convey&#8217;d himself as th&#8217; heir to th&#8217; Lady Lingare,</LINE>
<LINE>Daughter to Charlemain, who was the son</LINE>
<LINE>To Lewis the Emperor, and Lewis the son</LINE>
<LINE>Of Charles the Great. Also King Lewis the Tenth,</LINE>
<LINE>Who was sole heir to the usurper Capet,</LINE>
<LINE>Could not keep quiet in his conscience,</LINE>
<LINE>Wearing the crown of France, till satisfied</LINE>
<LINE>That fair Queen Isabel, his grandmother,</LINE>
<LINE>Was lineal of the Lady Ermengare,</LINE>
<LINE>Daughter to Charles, the foresaid Duke of Lorraine;</LINE>
<LINE>By the which marriage the line of Charles the Great</LINE>
<LINE>Was re-united to the crown of France.</LINE>
<LINE>So that, as clear as is the summer&#8217;s sun,</LINE>
<LINE>King Pepin&#8217;s title and Hugh Capet&#8217;s claim,</LINE>
<LINE>King Lewis his satisfaction, all appear</LINE>
<LINE>To hold in right and title of the female;</LINE>
<LINE>So do the kings of France unto this day.</LINE>
<LINE>Howbeit, they would hold up this Salique law</LINE>
<LINE>To bar your Highness claiming from the female,</LINE>
<LINE>And rather choose to hide them in a net</LINE>
<LINE>Than amply to imbar their crooked titles</LINE>
<LINE>Usurp&#8217;d from you and your progenitors.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. HEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>May I with right and conscience make this claim?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The sin upon my head, dread sovereign!</LINE>
<LINE>For in the book of Numbers is it writ,</LINE>
<LINE>When the man dies, let the inheritance</LINE>
<LINE>Descend unto the daughter. Gracious lord,</LINE>
<LINE>Stand for your own, unwind your bloody flag,</LINE>
<LINE>Look back into your mighty ancestors;</LINE>
<LINE>Go, my dread lord, to your great-grandsire&#8217;s tomb,</LINE>
<LINE>From whom you claim; invoke his warlike spirit,</LINE>
<LINE>And your great-uncle&#8217;s, Edward the Black Prince,</LINE>
<LINE>Who on the French ground play&#8217;d a tragedy,</LINE>
<LINE>Making defeat on the full power of France,</LINE>
<LINE>Whiles his most mighty father on a hill</LINE>
<LINE>Stood smiling to behold his lion&#8217;s whelp</LINE>
<LINE>Forage in blood of French nobility.</LINE>
<LINE>O noble English, that could entertain</LINE>
<LINE>With half their forces the full pride of France,</LINE>
<LINE>And let another half stand laughing by,</LINE>
<LINE>All out of work and cold for action!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ELY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Awake remembrance of these valiant dead,</LINE>
<LINE>And with your puissant arm renew their feats.</LINE>
<LINE>You are their heir, you sit upon their throne;</LINE>
<LINE>The blood and courage that renowned them</LINE>
<LINE>Runs in your veins; and my thrice-puissant liege</LINE>
<LINE>Is in the very May-morn of his youth,</LINE>
<LINE>Ripe for exploits and mighty enterprises.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EXE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your brother kings and monarchs of the earth</LINE>
<LINE>Do all expect that you should rouse yourself,</LINE>
<LINE>As did the former lions of your blood.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WEST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>They know your Grace hath cause, and means, and might;</LINE>
<LINE>So hath your Highness. Never King of England</LINE>
<LINE>Had nobles richer and more loyal subjects,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose hearts have left their bodies here in England,</LINE>
<LINE>And lie pavilion&#8217;d in the fields of France.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, let their bodies follow, my dear liege,</LINE>
<LINE>With blood and sword and fire, to win your right;</LINE>
<LINE>In aid whereof we of the spiritually</LINE>
<LINE>Will raise your Highness such a mighty sum</LINE>
<LINE>As never did the clergy at one time</LINE>
<LINE>Bring in to any of your ancestors.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. HEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We must not only arm t&#8217; invade the French,</LINE>
<LINE>But lay down our proportions to defend</LINE>
<LINE>Against the Scot, who will make road upon us</LINE>
<LINE>With all advantages.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>They of those marches, gracious sovereign,</LINE>
<LINE>Shall be a wall sufficient to defend</LINE>
<LINE>Our inland from the pilfering borderers.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. HEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We do not mean the coursing snatchers only,</LINE>
<LINE>But fear the main intendment of the Scot,</LINE>
<LINE>Who hath been still a giddy neighbor to us;</LINE>
<LINE>For you shall read that my great-grandfather</LINE>
<LINE>Never went with his forces into France</LINE>
<LINE>But that the Scot on his unfurnish&#8217;d kingdom</LINE>
<LINE>Came pouring like the tide into a breach,</LINE>
<LINE>With ample and brim fullness of his force,</LINE>
<LINE>Galling the gleaned land with hot assays,</LINE>
<LINE>Girding with grievous siege castles and towns;</LINE>
<LINE>That England being empty of defense,</LINE>
<LINE>Hath shook and trembled at th&#8217; ill neighborhood.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She hath been then more fear&#8217;d than harm&#8217;d, my liege;</LINE>
<LINE>For hear her but exampled by herself:</LINE>
<LINE>When all her chevalry hath been in France,</LINE>
<LINE>And she a mourning widow of her nobles,</LINE>
<LINE>She hath herself not only well defended</LINE>
<LINE>But taken and impounded as a stray</LINE>
<LINE>The King of Scots; whom she did send to France</LINE>
<LINE>To fill King Edward&#8217;s fame with prisoner kings,</LINE>
<LINE>And make her chronicle as rich with praise</LINE>
<LINE>As is the ooze and bottom of the sea</LINE>
<LINE>With sunken wrack and sumless treasuries.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ELY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But there&#8217;s a saying very old and true,</LINE>
<LINE offset="2">&#8220;If that you will France win,</LINE>
<LINE offset="2">Then with Scotland first begin.&#8221;</LINE>
<LINE>For once the eagle (England) being in prey,</LINE>
<LINE>To her unguarded nest the weasel (Scot)</LINE>
<LINE>Comes sneaking, and so sucks her princely eggs,</LINE>
<LINE>Playing the mouse in absence of the cat,</LINE>
<LINE>To &#8217;tame and havoc more than she can eat.</LINE>

<LINE>It follows then the cat must stay at home,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet that is but a crush&#8217;d necessity,</LINE>
<LINE>Since we have locks to safeguard necessaries,</LINE>
<LINE>And pretty traps to catch the petty thieves.</LINE>
<LINE>While that the armed hand doth fight abroad,</LINE>
<LINE>Th&#8217; advised head defends itself at home;</LINE>
<LINE>For government, though high, and low, and lower,</LINE>
<LINE>Put into parts, doth keep in one consent,</LINE>
<LINE>Congreeing in a full and natural close,</LINE>
<LINE>Like music.</LINE>

<LINE>Therefore doth heaven divide</LINE>
<LINE>The state of man in divers functions,</LINE>
<LINE>Setting endeavor in continual motion;</LINE>
<LINE>To which is fixed, as an aim or butt,</LINE>
<LINE>Obedience; for so work the honey-bees,</LINE>
<LINE>Creatures that by a rule in nature teach</LINE>
<LINE>The act of order to a peopled kingdom.</LINE>
<LINE>They have a king, and officers of sorts,</LINE>
<LINE>Where some, like magistrates, correct at home;</LINE>
<LINE>Others, like merchants, venter trade abroad;</LINE>
<LINE>Others, like soldiers, armed in their stings,</LINE>
<LINE>Make boot upon the summer&#8217;s velvet buds,</LINE>
<LINE>Which pillage they with merry march bring home</LINE>
<LINE>To the tent-royal of their emperor;</LINE>
<LINE>Who busied in his majesty surveys</LINE>
<LINE>The singing masons building roofs of gold,</LINE>
<LINE>The civil citizens kneading up the honey,</LINE>
<LINE>The poor mechanic porters crowding in</LINE>
<LINE>Their heavy burdens at his narrow gate,</LINE>
<LINE>The sad-ey&#8217;d justice, with his surly hum,</LINE>
<LINE>Delivering o&#8217;er to executors pale</LINE>
<LINE>The lazy yawning drone. I this infer,</LINE>
<LINE>That many things, having full reference</LINE>
<LINE>To one consent, may work contrariously,</LINE>
<LINE>As many arrows loosed several ways</LINE>
<LINE>Come to one mark; as many ways meet in one town;</LINE>
<LINE>As many fresh streams meet in one salt sea;</LINE>
<LINE>As many lines close in the dial&#8217;s centre;</LINE>
<LINE>So may a thousand actions, once afoot,</LINE>
<LINE>End in one purpose, and be all well borne</LINE>
<LINE>Without defeat. Therefore to France, my liege!</LINE>
<LINE>Divide your happy England into four,</LINE>
<LINE>Whereof take you one quarter into France,</LINE>
<LINE>And you withal shall make all Gallia shake.</LINE>
<LINE>If we, with thrice such powers left at home,</LINE>

<LINE>O&#8217;er France and all her (almost) kingly dukedoms,</LINE>

<LINE>Either our history shall with full mouth</LINE>

<LINE>Like Turkish mute, shall have a tongueless mouth,</LINE>
<LINE>Not worshipp&#8217;d with a waxen epitaph.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter Ambassadors of France attended.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Now are we well prepar&#8217;d to know the pleasure</LINE>

<SPEAKER>K. HEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We are no tyrant, but a Christian king,</LINE>
<LINE>Unto whose grace our passion is as subject</LINE>
<LINE>As is our wretches fett&#8217;red in our prisons;</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore with frank and with uncurbed plainness</LINE>
<LINE>Tell us the Dauphin&#8217;s mind.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. AMB.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Thus then in few:</LINE>
<LINE>Your Highness, lately sending into France,</LINE>
<LINE>Did claim some certain dukedoms, in the right</LINE>
<LINE>Of your great predecessor, King Edward the Third.</LINE>
<LINE>In answer of which claim, the prince our master</LINE>
<LINE>Says that you savor too much of your youth,</LINE>
<LINE>And bids you be advis&#8217;d: there&#8217;s nought in France</LINE>
<LINE>That can be with a nimble galliard won;</LINE>
<LINE>You cannot revel into dukedoms there.</LINE>
<LINE>He therefore sends you, meeter for your spirit,</LINE>
<LINE>This tun of treasure; and, in lieu of this,</LINE>
<LINE>Desires you let the dukedoms that you claim</LINE>
<LINE>Hear no more of you. This the Dauphin speaks.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>K. HEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We are glad the Dauphin is so pleasant with us,</LINE>
<LINE>His present and your pains we thank you for.</LINE>
<LINE>When we have match&#8217;d our rackets to these balls,</LINE>
<LINE>We will in France, by God&#8217;s grace, play a set</LINE>
<LINE>Shall strike his father&#8217;s crown into the hazard.</LINE>
<LINE>Tell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler</LINE>
<LINE>That all the courts of France will be disturb&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>With chaces. And we understand him well,</LINE>
<LINE>How he comes o&#8217;er us with our wilder days,</LINE>
<LINE>Not measuring what use we made of them.</LINE>
<LINE>We never valu&#8217;d this poor seat of England,</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore, living hence, did give ourself</LINE>
<LINE>To barbarous license; as &#8217;tis ever common</LINE>
<LINE>That men are merriest when they are from home.</LINE>
<LINE>But tell the Dauphin I will keep my state,</LINE>
<LINE>Be like a king, and show my sail of greatness</LINE>
<LINE>When I do rouse me in my throne of France.</LINE>
<LINE>For that I have laid by my majesty,</LINE>
<LINE>And plodded like a man for working-days;</LINE>
<LINE>But I will rise there with so full a glory</LINE>
<LINE>That I will dazzle all the eyes of France,</LINE>
<LINE>Yea, strike the Dauphin blind to look on us.</LINE>
<LINE>And tell the pleasant prince this mock of his</LINE>
<LINE>Hath turn&#8217;d his balls to gun-stones, and his soul</LINE>
<LINE>Shall stand sore charged for the wasteful vengeance</LINE>
<LINE>That shall fly with them; for many a thousand widows</LINE>
<LINE>Shall this his mock mock out of their dear husbands;</LINE>
<LINE>Mock mothers from their sons, mock castles down;</LINE>
<LINE>And some are yet ungotten and unborn</LINE>
<LINE>That shall have cause to curse the Dauphin&#8217;s scorn.</LINE>
<LINE>But this lies all within the will of God,</LINE>
<LINE>To whom I do appeal, and in whose name</LINE>
<LINE>Tell you the Dauphin I am coming on</LINE>
<LINE>To venge me as I may, and to put forth</LINE>
<LINE>My rightful hand in a well-hallow&#8217;d cause.</LINE>
<LINE>So get you hence in peace; and tell the Dauphin</LINE>
<LINE>His jest will savor but of shallow wit,</LINE>
<LINE>When thousands weep more than did laugh at it.&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Convey them with safe conduct.&#8212;Fare you well.</LINE>

<LINE>That may with reasonable swiftness add</LINE>
<LINE>More feathers to our wings; for, God before,</LINE>

<LINE>For my part, I care not; I say little; but when time shall serve, there shall be smiles&#8212;but that shall be as it may. I dare not fight, but I will wink and hold out mine iron.

<LINE>We therefore have great cause of thankfulness,</LINE>
<LINE>And shall forget the office of our hand</LINE>
<LINE>Sooner than quittance of desert and merit,</LINE>
<LINE>According to the weight and worthiness.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SCROOP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So service shall with steeled sinews toil,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. HEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We judge no less. Uncle of Exeter,</LINE>
<LINE>Enlarge the man committed yesterday,</LINE>
<LINE>That rail&#8217;d against our person. We consider</LINE>
<LINE>It was excess of wine that set him on,</LINE>
<LINE>And on his more advice we pardon him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SCROOP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That&#8217;s mercy, but too much security.</LINE>
<LINE>Let him be punish&#8217;d, sovereign, lest example</LINE>
<LINE>Breed, by his sufferance, more of such a kind.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. HEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, let us yet be merciful.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So may your Highness, and yet punish too.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Sir,</LINE>
<LINE>You show great mercy if you give him life</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. HEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alas, your too much love and care of me</LINE>
<LINE>Are heavy orisons &#8217;gainst this poor wretch!</LINE>
<LINE>If little faults, proceeding on distemper,</LINE>
<LINE>Shall not be wink&#8217;d at, how shall we stretch our eye</LINE>
<LINE>When capital crimes, chew&#8217;d, swallow&#8217;d, and digested,</LINE>
<LINE>Appear before us? We&#8217;ll yet enlarge that man,</LINE>
<LINE>Though Cambridge, Scroop, and Grey, in their dear care</LINE>
<LINE>And tender preservation of our person,</LINE>
<LINE>Would have him punish&#8217;d. And now to our French causes.</LINE>
<LINE>Who are the late commissioners?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I one, my lord.</LINE>
<LINE>Your Highness bade me ask for it today.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SCROOP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So did you me, my liege.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And I, my royal sovereign.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. HEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then, Richard Earl of Cambridge, there is yours;</LINE>
<LINE>There yours, Lord Scroop of Masham; and, sir knight,</LINE>
<LINE>Grey of Northumberland, this same is yours:</LINE>
<LINE>Read them, and know I know your worthiness.</LINE>
<LINE>My Lord of Westmorland, and uncle Exeter,</LINE>
<LINE>We will aboard tonight.&#8212;Why, how now, gentlemen?</LINE>
<LINE>What see you in those papers that you lose</LINE>
<LINE>So much complexion?&#8212;Look ye how they change!</LINE>
<LINE>Their cheeks are paper.&#8212;Why, what read you there</LINE>
<LINE>That have so cowarded and chas&#8217;d your blood</LINE>
<LINE>Out of appearance?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">I do confess my fault,</LINE>
<LINE>And do submit me to your Highness&#8217; mercy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREY., SCROOP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To which we all appeal.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. HEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The mercy that was quick in us but late,</LINE>
<LINE>By your own counsel is suppress&#8217;d and kill&#8217;d.</LINE>
<LINE>You must not dare (for shame) to talk of mercy,</LINE>
<LINE>For your own reasons turn into your bosoms,</LINE>
<LINE>As dogs upon their masters, worrying you.</LINE>
<LINE>See you, my princes and my noble peers,</LINE>
<LINE>These English monsters! My Lord of Cambridge here,</LINE>
<LINE>You know how apt our love was to accord</LINE>
<LINE>To furnish him with all appertinents</LINE>
<LINE>Belonging to his honor; and this man</LINE>
<LINE>Hath, for a few light crowns, lightly conspir&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>And sworn unto the practices of France</LINE>
<LINE>To kill us here in Hampton. To the which</LINE>
<LINE>This knight, no less for bounty bound to us</LINE>
<LINE>Than Cambridge is, hath likewise sworn. But O,</LINE>
<LINE>What shall I say to thee, Lord Scroop, thou cruel,</LINE>
<LINE>Ingrateful, savage, and inhuman creature?</LINE>
<LINE>Thou that didst bear the key of all my counsels,</LINE>
<LINE>That knew&#8217;st the very bottom of my soul,</LINE>
<LINE>That (almost) mightst have coin&#8217;d me into gold,</LINE>
<LINE>Wouldst thou have practic&#8217;d on me, for thy use?</LINE>
<LINE>May it be possible that foreign hire</LINE>
<LINE>Could out of thee extract one spark of evil</LINE>
<LINE>That might annoy my finger? &#8217;Tis so strange,</LINE>
<LINE>That, though the truth of it stands off as gross</LINE>
<LINE>As black and white, my eye will scarcely see it.</LINE>
<LINE>Treason and murder ever kept together,</LINE>
<LINE>As two yoke-devils sworn to either&#8217;s purpose,</LINE>
<LINE>Working so grossly in a natural cause</LINE>
<LINE>That admiration did not hoop at them;</LINE>
<LINE>But thou (&#8217;gainst all proportion) didst bring in</LINE>
<LINE>Wonder to wait on treason and on murder;</LINE>
<LINE>And whatsoever cunning fiend it was</LINE>
<LINE>That wrought upon thee so preposterously</LINE>
<LINE>Hath got the voice in hell for excellence;</LINE>
<LINE>And other devils that suggest by treasons</LINE>
<LINE>Do botch and bungle up damnation</LINE>
<LINE>With patches, colors, and with forms being fetch&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>From glist&#8217;ring semblances of piety;</LINE>
<LINE>But he that temper&#8217;d thee, bade thee stand up,</LINE>
<LINE>Gave thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason,</LINE>
<LINE>Unless to dub thee with the name of traitor.</LINE>
<LINE>If that same demon that hath gull&#8217;d thee thus</LINE>
<LINE>Should with his lion gait walk the whole world,</LINE>
<LINE>He might return to vasty Tartar back,</LINE>
<LINE>And tell the legions, &#8220;I can never win</LINE>
<LINE>A soul so easy as that Englishman&#8217;s.&#8221;</LINE>
<LINE>O, how hast thou with jealousy infected</LINE>
<LINE>The sweetness of affiance! Show men dutiful?</LINE>
<LINE>Why, so didst thou. Seem they grave and learned?</LINE>
<LINE>Why, so didst thou. Come they of noble family?</LINE>
<LINE>Why, so didst thou. Seem they religious?</LINE>
<LINE>Why, so didst thou. Or are they spare in diet,</LINE>
<LINE>Free from gross passion, or of mirth or anger,</LINE>
<LINE>Constant in spirit, not swerving with the blood,</LINE>
<LINE>Garnish&#8217;d and deck&#8217;d in modest complement,</LINE>
<LINE>Not working with the eye without the ear,</LINE>
<LINE>And but in purged judgment trusting neither?</LINE>
<LINE>Such and so finely bolted didst thou seem.</LINE>
<LINE>And thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot</LINE>
<LINE>To mark the full-fraught man and best indued</LINE>
<LINE>With some suspicion. I will weep for thee;</LINE>
<LINE>For this revolt of thine, methinks, is like</LINE>
<LINE>Another fall of man. Their faults are open,</LINE>
<LINE>Arrest them to the answer of the law,</LINE>
<LINE>And God acquit them of their practices!</LINE>

<LINE>Our purposes God justly hath discover&#8217;d,</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For me, the gold of France did not seduce,</LINE>
<LINE>Although I did admit it as a motive</LINE>

<LINE>But God be thanked for prevention,</LINE>
<LINE>Which I in sufferance heartily will rejoice,</LINE>

<LINE>Never did faithful subject more rejoice</LINE>

<LINE>Than I do at this hour joy o&#8217;er myself,</LINE>
<LINE>Prevented from a damned enterprise.</LINE>
<LINE>My fault, but not my body, pardon, sovereign.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. HEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>God quit you in his mercy! Hear your sentence.</LINE>
<LINE>You have conspir&#8217;d against our royal person,</LINE>
<LINE>Join&#8217;d with an enemy proclaim&#8217;d, and from his coffers</LINE>
<LINE>Receiv&#8217;d the golden earnest of our death;</LINE>
<LINE>Wherein you would have sold your king to slaughter,</LINE>
<LINE>His princes and his peers to servitude,</LINE>
<LINE>His subjects to oppression and contempt,</LINE>
<LINE>And his whole kingdom into desolation.</LINE>
<LINE>Touching our person seek we no revenge,</LINE>
<LINE>But we our kingdom&#8217;s safety must so tender,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose ruin you have sought, that to her laws</LINE>
<LINE>We do deliver you. Get you therefore hence,</LINE>
<LINE>Poor miserable wretches, to your death;</LINE>
<LINE>The taste whereof God of his mercy give</LINE>
<LINE>You patience to endure, and true repentance</LINE>
<LINE>Of all your dear offenses! Bear them hence.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt Cambridge, Scroop, and Grey, guarded.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Now, lords, for France; the enterprise whereof</LINE>
<LINE>Shall be to you as us, like glorious.</LINE>
<LINE>We doubt not of a fair and lucky war,</LINE>
<LINE>Since God so graciously hath brought to light</LINE>
<LINE>This dangerous treason lurking in our way</LINE>
<LINE>To hinder our beginnings. We doubt not now</LINE>
<LINE>But every rub is smoothed on our way.</LINE>
<LINE>Then forth, dear countrymen! Let us deliver</LINE>
<LINE>Our puissance into the hand of God,</LINE>
<LINE>Putting it straight in expedition.</LINE>

<LINE>Nay sure, he&#8217;s not in hell; he&#8217;s in Arthur&#8217;s bosom, if ever man went to Arthur&#8217;s bosom. &#8217;A made a finer end, and went away and it had been any christom child. &#8217;A parted ev&#8217;n just between twelve and one, ev&#8217;n at the turning o&#8217; th&#8217; tide; for after I saw him fumble with the sheets, and play with flowers, and smile upon his finger&#8217;s end, I knew there was but one way; for his nose was as sharp as a pen, and &#8217;a babbl&#8217;d of green fields. &#8220;How now, Sir John?&#8221; quoth I, &#8220;what, man? Be a&#8217; good cheer.&#8221; So &#8217;a cried out, &#8220;God, God, God!&#8221; three or four times. Now I, to comfort him, bid him &#8217;a should not think of God; I hop&#8217;d there was no need to trouble himself with any such thoughts yet. So &#8217;a bade me lay more clothes on his feet. I put my hand into the bed and felt them, and they were as cold as any stone; then I felt to his knees, and so up&#8217;ard and up&#8217;ard, and all was as cold as any stone.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>FR. KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thus comes the English with full power upon us,</LINE>
<LINE>And more than carefully it us concerns</LINE>
<LINE>To answer royally in our defenses.</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore the Dukes of Berri and of Britain,</LINE>
<LINE>Of Brabant and of Orleance, shall make forth,</LINE>
<LINE>And you, Prince Dauphin, with all swift dispatch,</LINE>
<LINE>To line and new repair our towns of war</LINE>
<LINE>With men of courage and with means defendant;</LINE>
<LINE>For England his approaches makes as fierce</LINE>
<LINE>As waters to the sucking of a gulf.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="3">My most redoubted father,</LINE>
<LINE>It is most meet we arm us &#8217;gainst the foe;</LINE>

<LINE>But that defenses, musters, preparations,</LINE>
<LINE>Should be maintain&#8217;d, assembled, and collected,</LINE>
<LINE>As were a war in expectation.</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore, I say, &#8217;tis meet we all go forth</LINE>
<LINE>To view the sick and feeble parts of France;</LINE>
<LINE>And let us do it with no show of fear,</LINE>
<LINE>No, with no more than if we heard that England</LINE>

<LINE offset="5">O, peace, Prince Dauphin,</LINE>
<LINE>You are too much mistaken in this king.</LINE>
<LINE>Question your Grace the late ambassadors,</LINE>
<LINE>With what great state he heard their embassy,</LINE>
<LINE>How well supplied with noble counsellors,</LINE>
<LINE>How modest in exception, and withal</LINE>
<LINE>How terrible in constant resolution,</LINE>
<LINE>And you shall find his vanities forespent</LINE>
<LINE>Were but the outside of the Roman Brutus,</LINE>
<LINE>Covering discretion with a coat of folly,</LINE>
<LINE>As gardeners do with ordure hide those roots</LINE>
<LINE>That shall first spring and be most delicate.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, &#8217;tis not so, my Lord High Constable;</LINE>
<LINE>But though we think it so, it is no matter.</LINE>
<LINE>In cases of defense &#8217;tis best to weigh</LINE>
<LINE>The enemy more mighty than he seems,</LINE>
<LINE>So the proportions of defense are fill&#8217;d;</LINE>
<LINE>Which, of a weak and niggardly projection,</LINE>

<LINE>Mangle the work of nature, and deface</LINE>

<LINE>He wills you, in the name of God Almighty,</LINE>
<LINE>That you divest yourself, and lay apart</LINE>
<LINE>The borrowed glories that by gift of heaven,</LINE>
<LINE>By law of nature and of nations, &#8217;longs</LINE>
<LINE>To him and to his heirs, namely, the crown,</LINE>
<LINE>And all wide-stretched honors that pertain</LINE>
<LINE>By custom, and the ordinance of times,</LINE>
<LINE>Unto the crown of France. That you may know</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis no sinister nor no awkward claim,</LINE>
<LINE>Pick&#8217;d from the worm-holes of long-vanish&#8217;d days,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor from the dust of old oblivion rak&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>He sends you this most memorable line,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FR. KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Or else what follows?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EXE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Bloody constraint; for if you hide the crown</LINE>
<LINE>Even in your hearts, there will he rake for it.</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore in fierce tempest is he coming,</LINE>
<LINE>In thunder and in earthquake, like a Jove,</LINE>
<LINE>That if requiring fail he will compel;</LINE>
<LINE>And bids you, in the bowels of the Lord,</LINE>
<LINE>Deliver up the crown, and to take mercy</LINE>
<LINE>On the poor souls for whom this hungry war</LINE>
<LINE>Opens his vasty jaws; and on your head</LINE>
<LINE>Turning the widows&#8217; tears, the orphans&#8217; cries,</LINE>
<LINE>The dead men&#8217;s blood, the privy maidens&#8217; groans,</LINE>
<LINE>For husbands, fathers, and betrothed lovers,</LINE>
<LINE>That shall be swallowed in this controversy.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>CHORUS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thus with imagin&#8217;d wing our swift scene flies</LINE>
<LINE>In motion of no less celerity</LINE>
<LINE>Than that of thought. Suppose that you have seen</LINE>
<LINE>The well-appointed king at Hampton pier</LINE>
<LINE>Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet</LINE>
<LINE>With silken streamers the young Phoebus fanning.</LINE>
<LINE>Play with your fancies: and in them behold</LINE>
<LINE>Upon the hempen tackle ship-boys climbing;</LINE>
<LINE>Hear the shrill whistle which doth order give</LINE>
<LINE>To sounds confus&#8217;d; behold the threaden sails,</LINE>
<LINE>Borne with th&#8217; invisible and creeping wind,</LINE>
<LINE>Draw the huge bottoms through the furrowed sea,</LINE>
<LINE>Breasting the lofty surge. O, do but think</LINE>
<LINE>You stand upon the rivage and behold</LINE>
<LINE>A city on th&#8217; inconstant billows dancing;</LINE>
<LINE>For so appears this fleet majestical,</LINE>
<LINE>Holding due course to Harflew. Follow, follow!</LINE>
<LINE>Grapple your minds to sternage of this navy,</LINE>
<LINE>And leave your England as dead midnight, still,</LINE>
<LINE>Guarded with grandsires, babies, and old women,</LINE>
<LINE>Either past or not arriv&#8217;d to pith and puissance;</LINE>
<LINE>For who is he, whose chin is but enrich&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>With one appearing hair, that will not follow</LINE>
<LINE>These cull&#8217;d and choice-drawn cavaliers to France?</LINE>
<LINE>Work, work your thoughts, and therein see a siege;</LINE>
<LINE>Behold the ordinance on their carriages,</LINE>
<LINE>With fatal mouths gaping on girded Harflew.</LINE>
<LINE>Suppose th&#8217; embassador from the French comes back,</LINE>
<LINE>Tells Harry that the King doth offer him</LINE>
<LINE>Katherine his daughter, and with her, to dowry,</LINE>
<LINE>Some petty and unprofitable dukedoms.</LINE>
<LINE>The offer likes not; and the nimble gunner</LINE>
<LINE>With linstock now the devilish cannon touches,</LINE>

<LINE>Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more;</LINE>

<LINE>In peace there&#8217;s nothing so becomes a man</LINE>
<LINE>As modest stillness and humility;</LINE>
<LINE>But when the blast of war blows in our ears,</LINE>
<LINE>Then imitate the action of the tiger;</LINE>
<LINE>Stiffen the sinews, conjure up the blood,</LINE>
<LINE>Disguise fair nature with hard-favor&#8217;d rage;</LINE>
<LINE>Then lend the eye a terrible aspect;</LINE>
<LINE>Let it pry through the portage of the head</LINE>

<LINE>Now set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide,</LINE>
<LINE>Hold hard the breath, and bend up every spirit</LINE>
<LINE>To his full height. On, on, you noblest English,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose blood is fet from fathers of war-proof!</LINE>
<LINE>Fathers that, like so many Alexanders,</LINE>
<LINE>Have in these parts from morn till even fought,</LINE>

</SPEECH>
<STAGEDIR>Exit with Bardolph and Pistol; Fluellen steps aside.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BOY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As young as I am, I have observ&#8217;d these three swashers. I am boy to them all three, but all they three, though they would serve me, could not be man to me; for indeed three such antics do not amount to a man. For Bardolph, he is white-liver&#8217;d and red-fac&#8217;d; by the means whereof &#8217;a faces it out, but fights not. For Pistol, he hath a killing tongue and a quiet sword; by the means whereof &#8217;a breaks words, and keeps whole weapons. For Nym, he hath heard that men of few words are the best men, and therefore he scorns to say his prayers, lest &#8217;a should be thought a coward; but his few bad words are match&#8217;d with as few good deeds; for &#8217;a never broke any man&#8217;s head but his own, and that was against a post when he was drunk. They will steal any thing, and call it purchase. Bardolph stole a lute-case, bore it twelve leagues, and sold it for three half-pence. Nym and Bardolph are sworn brothers in filching, and in Callice they stole a fire-shovel. I knew by that piece of service the men would carry coals. They would have me as familiar with men&#8217;s pockets as their gloves or their handkerchers; which makes much against my manhood, if I should take from another&#8217;s pocket to put into mine; for it is plain pocketing up of wrongs. I must leave them, and seek some better service. Their villainy goes against my weak stomach, and therefore I must cast it up.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit.</STAGEDIR>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Gower. Fluellen comes forward.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GOW.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Captain Fluellen, you must come presently to the mines; the Duke of Gloucester would speak with you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FLU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To the mines? Tell you the Duke, it is not so good to come to the mines; for look you, the mines is not according to the disciplines of the war; the concavities of it is not sufficient. For look you, th&#8217; athversary&#8212;you may discuss unto the Duke, look you&#8212;is digt himself four yard under the countermines. By Cheshu, I think &#8217;a will plow up all, if there is not better directions.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GOW.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The Duke of Gloucester, to whom the order of the siege is given, is altogether directed by an Irishman, a very valiant gentleman, i&#8217; faith.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FLU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is Captain Macmorris, is it not?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GOW.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I think it be.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FLU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By Cheshu, he is an ass, as in the world; I will verify as much in his beard. He has no more directions in the true disciplines of the wars, look you, of the Roman disciplines, than is a puppy-dog.</LINE>
</SPEECH>
<STAGEDIR>Enter Macmorris and Captain Jamy.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GOW.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here &#8217;a comes, and the Scots captain, Captain Jamy, with him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FLU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Captain Jamy is a marvellous falorous gentleman, that is certain, and of great expedition and knowledge in th&#8217; aunchiant wars, upon my particular knowledge of his directions. By Cheshu, he will maintain his argument as well as any military man in the world, in the disciplines of the pristine wars of the Romans.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAMY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I say gud day, Captain Fluellen.</LINE>

<LINE>By Chrish law, &#8217;tish ill done! The work ish give over, the trompet sound the retreat. By my hand I swear, and my father&#8217;s soul, the work ish ill done; it ish give over.

<SPEAKER>FLU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Captain Macmorris, I beseech you now, will you voutsafe me, look you, a few disputations with you, as partly touching or concerning the disciplines of the war, the Roman wars, in the way of argument, look you, and friendly communication; partly to satisfy my opinion, and partly for the satisfaction, look you, of my mind: as touching the direction of the military discipline, that is the point.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEAKER>JAMY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It sall be vary gud, gud feith, gud captens bath, and I sall quit you with gud leve, as I may pick occasion; that sall I, mary.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is no time to discourse, so Chrish save me. The day is hot, and the weather, and the wars, and the King, and the Dukes; it is no time to discourse. The town is beseech&#8217;d, and the trumpet call us to the breach, and we talk, and be Chrish, do nothing. &#8217;Tis shame for us all. So God sa&#8217; me, &#8217;tis shame to stand still, it is shame, by my hand; and there is throats to be cut, and works to be done, and there ish nothing done, so Christ sa&#8217; me law!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JAMY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By the mess, ere theise eyes of mine take themselves to slomber, ay&#8217;ll de gud service, or I&#8217;ll lig i&#8217; th&#8217; grund for it; ay, or go to death; and I&#8217;ll pay&#8217;t as valorously as I may, that sall I suerly do, that is the breff and the long. Mary, I wad full fain heard some question &#8217;tween you tway.</LINE>

<LINE>Captain Macmorris, I think, look you, under your correction, there is not many of your nation&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Of my nation? What ish my nation? Ish a villain, and a basterd, and a knave, and a rascal. What ish my nation? Who talks of my nation?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FLU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Look you, if you take the matter otherwise than is meant, Captain Macmorris, peradventure I shall think you do not use me with that affability as in discretion you ought to use me, look you, being as good a man as yourself, both in the disciplines of war, and in the derivation of my birth, and in other particularities.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do not know you so good a man as myself. So Chrish save me, I will cut off your head.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GOW.</SPEAKER>

<LINE>Is the Duke of Exeter safe?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FLU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The Duke of Exeter is as magnanimous as Agamemnon, and a man that I love and honor with my soul, and my heart, and my duty, and my live, and my living, and my uttermost power. He is not&#8212;God be praised and blessed!&#8212;any hurt in the world, but keeps the bridge most valiantly, with excellent discipline. There is an aunchient lieutenant there at the pridge, I think in my very conscience he is as valiant a man as Mark Antony, and he is a man of no estimation in the world, but I did see him do as gallant service.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>The Duke of Exeter doth love thee well.</LINE>

<LINE>Ay, I praise God, and I have merited some love at his hands.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PIST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Bardolph, a soldier firm and sound of heart,</LINE>
<LINE>And of buxom valor, hath by cruel fate,</LINE>
<LINE>And giddy Fortune&#8217;s furious fickle wheel,</LINE>
<LINE>That goddess blind,</LINE>
<LINE>That stands upon the rolling restless stone&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FLU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By your patience, Aunchient Pistol: Fortune is painted blind, with a muffler afore his eyes, to signify to you that Fortune is blind; and she is painted also with a wheel, to signify to you, which is the moral of it, that she is turning, and inconstant, and mutability, and variation; and her foot, look you, is fixed upon a spherical stone, which rolls, and rolls, and rolls. In good truth, the poet makes a most excellent description of it. Fortune is an excellent moral.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PIST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fortune is Bardolph&#8217;s foe, and frowns on him;</LINE>
<LINE>For he hath stol&#8217;n a pax, and hanged must &#8217;a be&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>A damned death!</LINE>
<LINE>Let gallows gape for dog, let man go free,</LINE>
<LINE>And let not hemp his windpipe suffocate.</LINE>
<LINE>But Exeter hath given the doom of death</LINE>
<LINE>For pax of little price.</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore go speak, the Duke will hear thy voice;</LINE>
<LINE>And let not Bardolph&#8217;s vital thread be cut</LINE>
<LINE>With edge of penny cord and vile reproach.</LINE>
<LINE>Speak, captain, for his life, and I will thee requite.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FLU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Aunchient Pistol, I do partly understand your meaning.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PIST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why then rejoice therefore.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FLU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Certainly, aunchient, it is not a thing to rejoice at; for if, look you, he were my brother, I would desire the Duke to use his good pleasure, and put him to execution; for discipline ought to be used.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>I&#8217;ll assure you, &#8217;a utt&#8217;red as prave words at the pridge as you shall see in a summer&#8217;s day. But it is very well; what he has spoke to me, that is well, I warrant you, when time is serve.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GOW.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, &#8217;tis a gull, a fool, a rogue, that now and then goes to the wars, to grace himself at his return into London under the form of a soldier. And such fellows are perfit in the great commanders&#8217; names, and they will learn you by rote where services were done&#8212;at such and such a sconce, at such a breach, at such a convoy; who came off bravely, who was shot, who disgrac&#8217;d, what terms the enemy stood on; and this they con perfitly in the phrase of war, which they trick up with new-tun&#8217;d oaths; and what a beard of the general&#8217;s cut and a horrid suit of the camp will do among foaming bottles and ale-wash&#8217;d wits, is wonderful to be thought on. But you must learn to know such slanders of the age, or else you may be marvellously mistook.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FLU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I tell you what, Captain Gower: I do perceive he is not the man that he would gladly make show to the world he is. If I find a hole in his coat, I will tell him my mind.</LINE>

<LINE>How now, Fluellen, cam&#8217;st thou from the bridge?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FLU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, so please your Majesty. The Duke of Exeter has very gallantly maintain&#8217;d the pridge. The French is gone off, look you, and there is gallant and most prave passages. Marry, th&#8217; athversary was have possession of the pridge, but he is enforced to retire, and the Duke of Exeter is master of the pridge. I can tell your Majesty, the Duke is a prave man.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. HEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What men have you lost, Fluellen?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FLU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The perdition of th&#8217; athversary hath been very great, reasonable great. Marry, for my part, I think the Duke hath lost never a man, but one that is like to be executed for robbing a church, one Bardolph, if your Majesty know the man. His face is all bubukles, and whelks, and knobs, and flames a&#8217; fire, and his lips blows at his nose, and it is like a coal of fire, sometimes plue and sometimes red, but his nose is executed, and his fire&#8217;s out.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. HEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We would have all such offenders so cut off; and we give express charge that in our marches through the country there be nothing compell&#8217;d from the villages; nothing taken but paid for; none of the French upbraided or abus&#8217;d in disdainful language; for when lenity and cruelty play for a kingdom, the gentler gamester is the soonest winner.</LINE>

<LINE>Thus says my King: Say thou to Harry of England, Though we seem&#8217;d dead, we did but sleep; advantage is a better soldier than rashness. Tell him we could have rebuk&#8217;d him at Harflew, but that we thought not good to bruise an injury till it were full ripe. Now we speak upon our cue, and our voice is imperial: England shall repent his folly, see his weakness, and admire our sufferance. Bid him therefore consider of his ransom, which must proportion the losses we have borne, the subjects we have lost, the disgrace we have digested; which in weight to re-answer, his pettiness would bow under. For our losses, his exchequer is too poor; for th&#8217; effusion of our blood, the muster of his kingdom too faint a number; and for our disgrace, his own person kneeling at our feet but a weak and worthless satisfaction. To this add defiance; and tell him, for conclusion, he hath betray&#8217;d his followers, whose condemnation is pronounc&#8217;d. So far my King and master; so much my office.</LINE>

<LINE>Thou dost thy office fairly. Turn thee back,</LINE>
<LINE>And tell thy King I do not seek him now,</LINE>
<LINE>But could be willing to march on to Callice</LINE>
<LINE>Without impeachment; for to say the sooth,</LINE>
<LINE>Though &#8217;tis no wisdom to confess so much</LINE>
<LINE>Unto an enemy of craft and vantage,</LINE>
<LINE>My people are with sickness much enfeebled,</LINE>
<LINE>My numbers lessen&#8217;d; and those few I have</LINE>
<LINE>Almost no better than so many French;</LINE>
<LINE>Who when they were in health, I tell thee, herald,</LINE>
<LINE>I thought upon one pair of English legs</LINE>
<LINE>Did march three Frenchmen. Yet forgive me, God,</LINE>
<LINE>That I do brag thus! This your air of France</LINE>
<LINE>Hath blown that vice in me. I must repent.</LINE>
<LINE>Go therefore tell thy master here I am;</LINE>
<LINE>My ransom is this frail and worthless trunk;</LINE>
<LINE>My army but a weak and sickly guard;</LINE>
<LINE>Yet, God before, tell him we will come on,</LINE>
<LINE>Though France himself and such another neighbor</LINE>
<LINE>Stand in our way. There&#8217;s for thy labor, Montjoy.</LINE>
<LINE>Go bid thy master well advise himself.</LINE>
<LINE>If we may pass, we will; if we be hind&#8217;red,</LINE>
<LINE>We shall your tawny ground with your red blood</LINE>
<LINE>Discolor; and so, Montjoy, fare you well.</LINE>
<LINE>The sum of all our answer is but this:</LINE>
<LINE>We would not seek a battle as we are,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor, as we are, we say we will not shun it.</LINE>

<LINE>What a long night is this! I will not change my horse with any that treads but on four pasterns. &#199;a, ha! He bounds from the earth, as if his entrails were hairs; le cheval volant, the Pegasus, chez les narines de feu! When I bestride him, I soar, I am a hawk; he trots the air; the earth sings when he touches it; the basest horn of his hoof is more musical than the pipe of Hermes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He&#8217;s of the color of the nutmeg.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>And of the heat of the ginger. It is a beast for Perseus. He is pure air and fire; and the dull elements of earth and water never appear in him, but only in patient stillness while his rider mounts him. He is indeed a horse, and all other jades you may call beasts.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Indeed, my lord, it is a most absolute and excellent horse.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, the man hath no wit that cannot, from the rising of the lark to the lodging of the lamb, vary deserv&#8217;d praise on my palfrey. It is a theme as fluent as the sea; turn the sands into eloquent tongues, and my horse is argument for them all. &#8217;Tis a subject for a sovereign to reason on, and for a sovereign&#8217;s sovereign to ride on; and for the world, familiar to us and unknown, to lay apart their particular functions and wonder at him. I once writ a sonnet in his praise and began thus: &#8220;Wonder of nature&#8221;&#8212;</LINE>

<LINE>Good morrow, brother Bedford. God Almighty!</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FLU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So! In the name of Jesu Christ, speak fewer. It is the greatest admiration in the universal world, when the true and aunchient prerogatifes and laws of the wars is not kept. If you would take the pains but to examine the wars of Pompey the Great, you shall find, I warrant you, that there is no tiddle taddle nor pibble babble in Pompey&#8217;s camp. I warrant you, you shall find the ceremonies of the wars, and the cares of it, and the forms of it, and the sobriety of it, and the modesty of it, to be otherwise.</LINE>

<LINE>Brother John Bates, is not that the morning which breaks yonder?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BATES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I think it be; but we have no great cause to desire the approach of day.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WILL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We see yonder the beginning of the day, but I think we shall never see the end of it. Who goes there?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. HEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A friend.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WILL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Under what captain serve you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. HEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Under Sir Thomas Erpingham.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WILL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A good old commander and a most kind gentleman. I pray you, what thinks he of our estate?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. HEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Even as men wrack&#8217;d upon a sand, that look to be wash&#8217;d off the next tide.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BATES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He hath not told his thought to the King?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. HEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No; nor it is not meet he should. For though I speak it to you, I think the King is but a man, as I am. The violet smells to him as it doth to me; the element shows to him as it doth to me; all his senses have but human conditions. His ceremonies laid by, in his nakedness he appears but a man; and though his affections are higher mounted than ours, yet when they stoop, they stoop with the like wing. Therefore, when he sees reason of fears, as we do, his fears, out of doubt, be of the same relish as ours are; yet in reason, no man should possess him with any appearance of fear, lest he, by showing it, should dishearten his army.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BATES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He may show what outward courage he will; but I believe, as cold a night as &#8217;tis, he could wish himself in Thames up to the neck; and so I would he were, and I by him, at all adventures, so we were quit here.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. HEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By my troth, I will speak my conscience of the King: I think he would not wish himself any where but where he is.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BATES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then I would he were here alone; so should he be sure to be ransom&#8217;d, and a many poor men&#8217;s lives sav&#8217;d.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. HEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I dare say you love him not so ill to wish him here alone, howsoever you speak this to feel other men&#8217;s minds. Methinks I could not die any where so contented as in the King&#8217;s company, his cause being just and his quarrel honorable.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WILL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That&#8217;s more than we know.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BATES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, or more than we should seek after; for we know enough, if we know we are the King&#8217;s subjects. If his cause be wrong, our obedience to the King wipes the crime of it out of us.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WILL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But if the cause be not good, the King himself hath a heavy reckoning to make, when all those legs, and arms, and heads, chopp&#8217;d off in a battle, shall join together at the latter day and cry all, &#8220;We died at such a place&#8221;&#8212;some swearing, some crying for a surgeon, some upon their wives left poor behind them, some upon the debts they owe, some upon their children rawly left. I am afeard there are few die well that die in a battle; for how can they charitably dispose of any thing, when blood is their argument? Now, if these men do not die well, it will be a black matter for the King that led them to it; who to disobey were against all proportion of subjection.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. HEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So, if a son that is by his father sent about merchandise do sinfully miscarry upon the sea, the imputation of his wickedness, by your rule, should be impos&#8217;d upon his father that sent him; or if a servant, under his master&#8217;s command transporting a sum of money, be assail&#8217;d by robbers and die in many irreconcil&#8217;d iniquities, you may call the business of the master the author of the servant&#8217;s damnation. But this is not so. The King is not bound to answer the particular endings of his soldiers, the father of his son, nor the master of his servant; for they purpose not their death when they purpose their services. Besides, there is no king, be his cause never so spotless, if it come to the arbitrement of swords, can try it out with all unspotted soldiers. Some, peradventure, have on them the guilt of premeditated and contriv&#8217;d murder; some, of beguiling virgins with the broken seals of perjury; some, making the wars their bulwark, that have before gor&#8217;d the gentle bosom of peace with pillage and robbery. Now, if these men have defeated the law and outrun native punishment, though they can outstrip men, they have no wings to fly from God. War is his beadle, war is his vengeance; so that here men are punish&#8217;d for before-breach of the King&#8217;s laws in now the King&#8217;s quarrel. Where they fear&#8217;d the death, they have borne life away; and where they would be safe, they perish. Then if they die unprovided, no more is the King guilty of their damnation than he was before guilty of those impieties for the which they are now visited. Every subject&#8217;s duty is the King&#8217;s, but every subject&#8217;s soul is his own. Therefore should every soldier in the wars do as every sick man in his bed, wash every mote out of his conscience; and dying so, death is to him advantage; or not dying, the time was blessedly lost wherein such preparation was gain&#8217;d; and in him that escapes, it were not sin to think that making God so free an offer, He let him outlive that day to see His greatness and to teach others how they should prepare.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WILL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis certain, every man that dies ill, the ill upon his own head, the King is not to answer it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BATES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do not desire he should answer for me, and yet I determine to fight lustily for him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. HEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I myself heard the King say he would not be ransom&#8217;d.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WILL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, he said so, to make us fight cheerfully; but when our throats are cut, he may be ransom&#8217;d, and we ne&#8217;er the wiser.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. HEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If I live to see it, I will never trust his word after.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Upon the King! Let us our lives, our souls,</LINE>

<LINE>We must bear all. O hard condition,</LINE>

<LINE>Save ceremony, save general ceremony?</LINE>

<LINE>Creating awe and fear in other men?</LINE>

<LINE>With profitable labor to his grave:</LINE>

<LINE>I think it is in Macedon where Alexander is porn. I tell you, captain, if you look in the maps of the orld, I warrant you sall find, in the comparisons between Macedon and Monmouth, that the situations, look you, is both alike. There is a river in Macedon, and there is also moreover a river at Monmouth. It is call&#8217;d Wye at Monmouth; but it is out of my prains what is the name of the other river; but &#8217;tis all one, &#8217;tis alike as my fingers is to my fingers, and there is salmons in both. If you mark Alexander&#8217;s life well, Harry of Monmouth&#8217;s life is come after it indifferent well, for there is figures in all things. Alexander, God knows, and you know, in his rages, and his furies, and his wraths, and his cholers, and his moods, and his displeasures, and his indignations, and also being a little intoxicates in his prains, did, in his ales and his angers, look you, kill his best friend, Clytus.</LINE>

<LINE>Be here presented. Now we bear the King</LINE>
<LINE>Toward Callice; grant him there; there seen,</LINE>
<LINE>Heave him away upon your winged thoughts</LINE>
<LINE>Athwart the sea. Behold, the English beach</LINE>
<LINE>Pales in the flood with men, wives, and boys,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose shouts and claps out-voice the deep-mouth&#8217;d sea,</LINE>
<LINE>Which like a mighty whiffler &#8217;fore the King</LINE>
<LINE>Seems to prepare his way. So let him land,</LINE>
<LINE>And solemnly see him set on to London.</LINE>
<LINE>So swift a pace hath thought that even now</LINE>
<LINE>You may imagine him upon Blackheath;</LINE>
<LINE>Where that his lords desire him to have borne</LINE>
<LINE>His bruised helmet and his bended sword</LINE>
<LINE>Before him through the city. He forbids it,</LINE>
<LINE>Being free from vainness and self-glorious pride;</LINE>
<LINE>Giving full trophy, signal, and ostent</LINE>
<LINE>Quite from himself to God. But now behold,</LINE>

<LINE>Great Kings of France and England: that I have labor&#8217;d</LINE>

<LINE>You have congreeted, let it not disgrace me,</LINE>
<LINE>If I demand, before this royal view,</LINE>
<LINE>What rub or what impediment there is,</LINE>
<LINE>Why that the naked, poor, and mangled Peace,</LINE>
<LINE>Dear nurse of arts, plenties, and joyful births,</LINE>
<LINE>Should not in this best garden of the world,</LINE>
<LINE>Our fertile France, put up her lovely visage?</LINE>
<LINE>Alas, she hath from France too long been chas&#8217;d,</LINE>

<LINE>Unpruned dies; her hedges even-pleach&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Like prisoners wildly overgrown with hair,</LINE>

<LINE>That should deracinate such savagery;</LINE>
<LINE>The even mead, that erst brought sweetly forth</LINE>
<LINE>The freckled cowslip, burnet, and green clover,</LINE>
<LINE>Wanting the scythe withal, uncorrected, rank,</LINE>
<LINE>Conceives by idleness, and nothing teems</LINE>
<LINE>But hateful docks, rough thistles, kecksies, burs,</LINE>
<LINE>Losing both beauty and utility;</LINE>
<LINE>And all our vineyards, fallows, meads, and hedges,</LINE>

<LINE>Even so our houses, and ourselves, and children,</LINE>
<LINE>Have lost, or do not learn for want of time,</LINE>
<LINE>The sciences that should become our country,</LINE>
<LINE>But grow like savages&#8212;as soldiers will</LINE>

<LINE>O fair Katherine, if you will love me soundly with your French heart, I will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your English tongue. Do you like me, Kate?</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. HEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I said so, dear Katherine, and I must not blush to affirm it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE><FRENCH>O bon Dieu! Les langues des hommes sont pleines de tromperies.</FRENCH></LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. HEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What says she, fair one? That the tongues of men are full of deceits?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALICE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE><FRENCH>Oui, dat de tongeus of de mans is be full of deceits: dat is de Princess.</FRENCH></LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. HEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The Princess is the better Englishwoman. I&#8217; faith, Kate, my wooing is fit for thy understanding. I am glad thou canst speak no better English, for if thou couldst, thou wouldst find me such a plain king that thou wouldst think I had sold my farm to buy my crown. I know no ways to mince it in love, but directly to say &#8220;I love you&#8221;; then if you urge me farther than to say &#8220;Do you in faith?&#8221; I wear out my suit. Give me your answer, i&#8217; faith, do, and so clap hands and a bargain. How say you, lady?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE><FRENCH>Sauf votre honneur</FRENCH>, me understand well.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. HEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, if you would put me to verses, or to dance for your sake, Kate, why, you undid me: for the one, I have neither words nor measure; and for the other, I have no strength in measure, yet a reasonable measure in strength. If I could win a lady at leap-frog, or by vauting into my saddle with my armor on my back, under the correction of bragging be it spoken, I should quickly leap into a wife. Or if I might buffet for my love, or bound my horse for her favors, I could lay on like a butcher, and sit like a jack-an-apes, never off. But, before God, Kate, I cannot look greenly, nor gasp out my eloquence, nor I have no cunning in protestation; only downright oaths, which I never use till urg&#8217;d, nor never break for urging. If thou canst love a fellow of this temper, Kate, whose face is not worth sunburning, that never looks in his glass for love of any thing he sees there, let thine eye be thy cook. I speak to thee plain soldier. If thou canst love me for this, take me! If not, to say to thee that I shall die, is true; but for thy love, by the Lord, no; yet I love thee too. And while thou liv&#8217;st, dear Kate, take a fellow of plain and uncoin&#8217;d constancy, for he perforce must do thee right, because he hath not the gift to woo in other places; for these fellows of infinite tongue, that can rhyme themselves into ladies&#8217; favors, they do always reason themselves out again. What? A speaker is but a prater, a rhyme is but a ballad; a good leg will fall, a straight back will stoop, a black beard will turn white, a curl&#8217;d pate will grow bald, a fair face will wither, a full eye will wax hollow; but a good heart, Kate, is the sun and the moon, or rather the sun and not the moon; for it shines bright and never changes, but keeps his course truly. If thou would have such a one, take me! And take me, take a soldier; take a soldier, take a king. And what say&#8217;st thou then to my love? Speak, my fair, and fairly, I pray thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is it possible dat I sould love de ennemie of France?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. HEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, it is not possible you should love the enemy of France, Kate; but in loving me, you should love the friend of France; for I love France so well that I will not part with a village of it; I will have it all mine. And, Kate, when France is mine and I am yours, then yours is France and you are mine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I cannot tell wat is dat.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. HEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, Kate? I will tell thee in French, which I am sure will hang upon my tongue like a new-married wife about her husband&#8217;s neck, hardly to be shook off. Je quand sur le possession de France, et quand vous avez le possession de moi&#8212;let me see, what then? Saint Denis be my speed!&#8212;donc votre est France et vous &#234;tes mienne. It is as easy for me, Kate, to conquer the kingdom as to speak so much more French. I shall never move thee in French, unless it be to laugh at me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE><FRENCH>Sauf votre honneur, le Fran&#231;ois que vous parlez, il est meilleur que l&#8217;Anglois lequel je parle.</FRENCH></LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. HEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, faith, is&#8217;t not, Kate; but thy speaking of my tongue, and I thine, most truly falsely, must needs be granted to be much at one. But, Kate, dost thou understand thus much English? Canst thou love me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I cannot tell.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. HEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Can any of your neighbors tell, Kate? I&#8217;ll ask them. Come, I know thou lovest me; and at night, when you come into your closet, You&#8217;ll question this gentlewoman about me; and I know, Kate, you will to her dispraise those parts in me that you love with your heart. But, good Kate, mock me mercifully, the rather, gentle Princess, because I love thee cruelly. If ever thou beest mine, Kate, as I have a saving faith within me tells me thou shalt, I get thee with scambling, and thou must therefore needs prove a good soldier-breeder. Shall not thou and I, between Saint Denis and Saint George, compound a boy, half French, half English, that shall go to Constantinople and take the Turk by the beard? Shall we not? What say&#8217;st thou, my fair flower-de-luce?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do not know dat.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. HEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No; &#8217;tis hereafter to know, but now to promise. Do but now promise, Kate, you will endeavor for your French part of such a boy; and for my English moi&#8217;ty, take the word of a king and a bachelor. How answer you, la plus belle Katherine du monde, mon tr&#232;s cher et devin d&#233;esse?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your Majestee ave fausse French enough to deceive de most sage demoiselle dat is en France.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. HEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now fie upon my false French! By mine honor, in true English, I love thee, Kate; by which honor I dare not swear thou lovest me, yet my blood begins to flatter me that thou dost&#8212;notwithstanding the poor and untempering effect of my visage. Now beshrew my father&#8217;s ambition! He was thinking of civil wars when he got me; therefore was I created with a stubborn outside, with an aspect of iron, that when I come to woo ladies, I fright them. But in faith, Kate, the elder I wax, the better I shall appear. My comfort is, that old age, that ill layer-up of beauty, can do no more spoil upon my face. Thou hast me, if thou hast me, at the worst; and thou shalt wear me, if thou wear me, better and better; and therefore tell me, most fair Katherine, will you have me? Put off your maiden blushes, avouch the thoughts of your heart with the looks of an empress, take me by the hand, and say, &#8220;Harry of England, I am thine&#8221;; which word thou shalt no sooner bless mine ear withal, but I will tell thee aloud, &#8220;England is thine, Ireland is thine, France is thine, and Henry Plantagenet is thine&#8221;; who, though I speak it before his face, if he be not fellow with the best king, thou shalt find the best king of good fellows. Come, your answer in broken music; for thy voice is music and thy English broken; therefore, queen of all, Katherine, break thy mind to me in broken English&#8212;wilt thou have me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Dat is as it shall please de roi mon p&#232;re.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. HEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, it will please him well, Kate; it shall please him, Kate.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Den it sall also content me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>It is not a fashion for the maids in France to kiss before they are married, would she say?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALICE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE><FRENCH>Oui, vraiment.</FRENCH></LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. HEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O Kate, nice customs cur&#8217;sy to great kings. Dear Kate, you and I cannot be confin&#8217;d within the weak list of a country&#8217;s fashion. We are the makers of manners, Kate; and the liberty that follows our places stops the mouth of all find-faults, as I will do yours, for upholding the nice fashion of your country in denying me a kiss; therefore patiently and yielding.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Kissing her.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>You have witchcraft in your lips, Kate; there is more eloquence in a sugar touch of them than in the tongues of the French council; and they should sooner persuade Harry of England than a general petition of monarchs. Here comes your father.</LINE>
</SPEECH>
<STAGEDIR>Enter the French Power and the English Lords.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BUR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>God save your Majesty! My royal cousin, teach you our princess English?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. HEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would have her learn, my fair cousin, how perfectly I love her, and that is good English.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BUR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is she not apt?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. HEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Our tongue is rough, coz, and my condition is not smooth; so that having neither the voice nor the heart of flattery about me, I cannot so conjure up the spirit of love in her, that he will appear in his true likeness.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BUR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pardon the frankness of my mirth, if I answer you for that. If you would conjure in her, you must make a circle; if conjure up Love in her in his true likeness, he must appear naked and blind. Can you blame her then, being a maid yet ros&#8217;d over with the virgin crimson of modesty, if she deny the appearance of a naked blind boy in her naked seeing self? It were, my lord, a hard condition for a maid to consign to.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. HEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yet they do wink and yield, as love is blind and enforces.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BUR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>They are then excus&#8217;d, my lord, when they see not what they do.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. HEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then, good my lord, teach your cousin to consent winking.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BUR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will wink on her to consent, my lord, if you will teach her to know my meaning; for maids, well summer&#8217;d and warm kept, are like flies at Bartholomew-tide, blind, though they have their eyes, and then they will endure handling, which before would not abide looking on.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. HEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This moral ties me over to time and a hot summer; and so I shall catch the fly, your cousin, in the latter end, and she must be blind too.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BUR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As love is, my lord, before it loves.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. HEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is so; and you may, some of you, thank love for my blindness, who cannot see many a fair French city for one fair French maid that stands in my way.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FR. KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, my lord, you see them perspectively: the cities turn&#8217;d into a maid; for they are all girdled with maiden walls that war hath never ent&#8217;red.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. HEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Shall Kate be my wife?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FR. KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So please you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. HEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am content, so the maiden cities you talk of may wait on her; so the maid that stood in the way for my wish shall show me the way to my will.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FR. KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We have consented to all terms of reason.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>Only he hath not yet subscribed this:</LINE>
<LINE>Where your Majesty demands that the King of France, having any occasion to write for matter of grant, shall name your Highness in this form, and with this addition, in French, Notre tr&#232;s cher fils Henri, Roi d&#8217;Angleterre, H&#233;ritier de France; and thus in Latin, Praeclarissimus filius noster Henricus, Rex Angliae, et Heres Franciae.</LINE>
