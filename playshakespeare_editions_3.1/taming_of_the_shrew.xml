<SCENELOCATION>Before an alehouse on a heath.</SCENELOCATION>
<SCENEPERSONAE>(Christopher Sly, Hostess, Lord, Hunters, First Servingman, Players)</SCENEPERSONAE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter beggar, Christophero Sly, and Hostess.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SLY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll pheeze you, in faith.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A pair of stocks, you rogue!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SLY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Y&#8217; are a baggage, the Slys are no rogues. Look in the chronicles; we came in with Richard Conqueror. Therefore paucas pallabris, let the world slide. Sessa!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You will not pay for the glasses you have burst?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SLY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, not a denier. Go by, Saint Jeronimy! Go to thy cold bed, and warm thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know my remedy; I must go fetch the thirdborough.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SLY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Third, or fourth, or fifth borough, I&#8217;ll answer him by law. I&#8217;ll not budge an inch, boy; let him come, and kindly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Falls asleep.</STAGEDIR>

<STAGEDIR>Wind horns. Enter a Lord from hunting, with his Train.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Huntsman, I charge thee, tender well my hounds</LINE>
<LINE>(Brach Merriman, the poor cur, is emboss&#8217;d),</LINE>
<LINE>And couple Clowder with the deep-mouth&#8217;d brach.</LINE>
<LINE>Saw&#8217;st thou not, boy, how Silver made it good</LINE>
<LINE>At the hedge-corner, in the coldest fault?</LINE>
<LINE>I would not lose the dog for twenty pound.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. HUN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, Belman is as good as he, my lord;</LINE>
<LINE>He cried upon it at the merest loss,</LINE>
<LINE>And twice today pick&#8217;d out the dullest scent.</LINE>
<LINE>Trust me, I take him for the better dog.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou art a fool; if Echo were as fleet,</LINE>
<LINE>I would esteem him worth a dozen such.</LINE>
<LINE>But sup them well, and look unto them all,</LINE>
<LINE>Tomorrow I intend to hunt again.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. HUN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What&#8217;s here? One dead, or drunk? See, doth he breathe?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. HUN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He breathes, my lord. Were he not warm&#8217;d with ale,</LINE>
<LINE>This were a bed but cold to sleep so soundly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O monstrous beast, how like a swine he lies!</LINE>
<LINE>Grim death, how foul and loathsome is thine image!</LINE>
<LINE>Sirs, I will practice on this drunken man.</LINE>
<LINE>What think you, if he were convey&#8217;d to bed,</LINE>
<LINE>Wrapp&#8217;d in sweet clothes, rings put upon his fingers,</LINE>
<LINE>A most delicious banquet by his bed,</LINE>
<LINE>And brave attendants near him when he wakes,</LINE>
<LINE>Would not the beggar then forget himself?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. HUN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Believe me, lord, I think he cannot choose.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. HUN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It would seem strange unto him when he wak&#8217;d.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Even as a flatt&#8217;ring dream or worthless fancy.</LINE>
<LINE>Then take him up, and manage well the jest.</LINE>
<LINE>Carry him gently to my fairest chamber,</LINE>
<LINE>And hang it round with all my wanton pictures.</LINE>
<LINE>Balm his foul head in warm distilled waters,</LINE>
<LINE>And burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet.</LINE>
<LINE>Procure me music ready when he wakes,</LINE>
<LINE>To make a dulcet and a heavenly sound;</LINE>
<LINE>And if he chance to speak, be ready straight,</LINE>
<LINE>And with a low submissive reverence</LINE>
<LINE>Say, &#8220;What is it your honor will command?&#8221;</LINE>
<LINE>Let one attend him with a silver basin</LINE>
<LINE>Full of rose-water and bestrew&#8217;d with flowers,</LINE>
<LINE>Another bear the ewer, the third a diaper,</LINE>
<LINE>And say, &#8220;Will&#8217;t please your lordship cool your hands?&#8221;</LINE>
<LINE>Some one be ready with a costly suit,</LINE>
<LINE>And ask him what apparel he will wear;</LINE>
<LINE>Another tell him of his hounds and horse,</LINE>
<LINE>And that his lady mourns at his disease.</LINE>
<LINE>Persuade him that he hath been lunatic,</LINE>
<LINE>And when he says he is, say that he dreams,</LINE>
<LINE>For he is nothing but a mighty lord.</LINE>
<LINE>This do, and do it kindly, gentle sirs;</LINE>
<LINE>It will be pastime passing excellent,</LINE>
<LINE>If it be husbanded with modesty.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. HUN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, I warrant you we will play our part</LINE>
<LINE>As he shall think by our true diligence</LINE>
<LINE>He is no less than what we say he is.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Take him up gently and to bed with him,</LINE>
<LINE>And each one to his office when he wakes.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Some bear out Sly.</STAGEDIR>

<STAGEDIR>Sound trumpets.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Sirrah, go see what trumpet &#8217;tis that sounds.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit Servingman.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Belike some noble gentleman that means</LINE>
<LINE>(Travelling some journey) to repose him here.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter Servingman.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>How now? Who is it?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. SERVING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>An&#8217;t please your honor, players</LINE>
<LINE>That offer service to your lordship.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Players.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Bid them come near. Now, fellows, you are welcome.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALL. PLAYERS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We thank your honor.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do you intend to stay with me tonight?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. PLAY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So please your lordship to accept our duty.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>With all my heart. This fellow I remember</LINE>
<LINE>Since once he play&#8217;d a farmer&#8217;s eldest son.</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Twas where you woo&#8217;d the gentlewoman so well.</LINE>
<LINE>I have forgot your name; but sure that part</LINE>
<LINE>Was aptly fitted and naturally perform&#8217;d.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. PLAY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I think &#8217;twas Soto that your honor means.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis very true; thou didst it excellent.</LINE>
<LINE>Well, you are come to me in happy time,</LINE>
<LINE>The rather for I have some sport in hand,</LINE>
<LINE>Wherein your cunning can assist me much.</LINE>
<LINE>There is a lord will hear you play tonight;</LINE>
<LINE>But I am doubtful of your modesties,</LINE>
<LINE>Lest, over-eyeing of his odd behavior</LINE>
<LINE>(For yet his honor never heard a play),</LINE>
<LINE>You break into some merry passion,</LINE>
<LINE>And so offend him; for I tell you, sirs,</LINE>
<LINE>If you should smile, he grows impatient.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. PLAY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fear not, my lord, we can contain ourselves,</LINE>
<LINE>Were he the veriest antic in the world.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go, sirrah, take them to the buttery,</LINE>
<LINE>And give them friendly welcome every one.</LINE>
<LINE>Let them want nothing that my house affords.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exit one with the Players.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Sirrah, go you to Barthol&#8217;mew my page,</LINE>
<LINE>And see him dress&#8217;d in all suits like a lady;</LINE>
<LINE>That done, conduct him to the drunkard&#8217;s chamber,</LINE>
<LINE>And call him madam, do him obeisance.</LINE>
<LINE>Tell him from me, as he will win my love,</LINE>
<LINE>He bear himself with honorable action,</LINE>
<LINE>Such as he hath observ&#8217;d in noble ladies</LINE>
<LINE>Unto their lords, by them accomplished;</LINE>
<LINE>Such duty to the drunkard let him do,</LINE>
<LINE>With soft low tongue and lowly courtesy,</LINE>
<LINE>And say, &#8220;What is&#8217;t your honor will command,</LINE>
<LINE>Wherein your lady, and your humble wife,</LINE>
<LINE>May show her duty and make known her love?&#8221;</LINE>
<LINE>And then with kind embracements, tempting kisses,</LINE>
<LINE>And with declining head into his bosom,</LINE>
<LINE>Bid him shed tears, as being overjoyed</LINE>
<LINE>To see her noble lord restor&#8217;d to health,</LINE>
<LINE>Who for this seven years hath esteemed him</LINE>
<LINE>No better than a poor and loathsome beggar.</LINE>
<LINE>And if the boy have not a woman&#8217;s gift</LINE>
<LINE>To rain a shower of commanded tears,</LINE>
<LINE>An onion will do well for such a shift,</LINE>
<LINE>Which in a napkin (being close convey&#8217;d)</LINE>
<LINE>Shall in despite enforce a watery eye.</LINE>
<LINE>See this dispatch&#8217;d with all the haste thou canst;</LINE>
<LINE>Anon I&#8217;ll give thee more instructions.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exit First Servingman.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>I know the boy will well usurp the grace,</LINE>
<LINE>Voice, gait, and action of a gentlewoman.</LINE>
<LINE>I long to hear him call the drunkard husband,</LINE>
<LINE>And how my men will stay themselves from laughter</LINE>
<LINE>When they do homage to this simple peasant.</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll in to counsel them; haply my presence</LINE>
<LINE>May well abate the over-merry spleen,</LINE>
<LINE>Which otherwise would grow into extremes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SCENELOCATION>A bedchamber in the Lord&#8217;s house.</SCENELOCATION>
<SCENEPERSONAE>(Sly, Servants, Lord, Page, Messenger)</SCENEPERSONAE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter aloft the drunkard Sly with Attendants, some with apparel, basin and ewer, and other appurtenances, and Lord.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SLY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For God&#8217;s sake, a pot of small ale.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. SERV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Will&#8217;t please your lordship drink a cup of sack?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. SERV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Will&#8217;t please your honor taste of these conserves?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>3. SERV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What raiment will your honor wear today?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SLY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am Christophero Sly, call not me honor nor lordship. I ne&#8217;er drank sack in my life; and if you give me any conserves, give me conserves of beef. Ne&#8217;er ask me what raiment I&#8217;ll wear, for I have no more doublets than backs, no more stockings than legs, nor no more shoes than feet&#8212;nay, sometime more feet than shoes, or such shoes as my toes look through the overleather.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Heaven cease this idle humor in your honor!</LINE>
<LINE>O that a mighty man of such descent,</LINE>
<LINE>Of such possessions, and so high esteem,</LINE>
<LINE>Should be infused with so foul a spirit!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SLY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, would you make me mad? Am not I Christopher Sly, old Sly&#8217;s son of Burton-heath, by birth a pedlar, by education a card-maker, by transmutation a bear-herd, and now by present profession a tinker? Ask Marian Hacket, the fat ale-wife of Wincot, if she know me not. If she say I am not fourteen pence on the score for sheer ale, score me up for the lying&#8217;st knave in Christendom. What! I am not bestraught. Here&#8217;s&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>3. SERV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, this it is that makes your lady mourn!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. SERV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, this is it that makes your servants droop!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hence comes it that your kindred shuns your house,</LINE>
<LINE>As beaten hence by your strange lunacy.</LINE>
<LINE>O noble lord, bethink thee of thy birth,</LINE>
<LINE>Call home thy ancient thoughts from banishment,</LINE>
<LINE>And banish hence these abject lowly dreams.</LINE>
<LINE>Look how thy servants do attend on thee,</LINE>
<LINE>Each in his office ready at thy beck.</LINE>
<LINE>Wilt thou have music? Hark, Apollo plays,</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Music.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>And twenty caged nightingales do sing.</LINE>
<LINE>Or wilt thou sleep? We&#8217;ll have thee to a couch,</LINE>
<LINE>Softer and sweeter than the lustful bed</LINE>
<LINE>On purpose trimm&#8217;d up for Semiramis.</LINE>
<LINE>Say thou wilt walk; we will bestrow the ground.</LINE>
<LINE>Or wilt thou ride? Thy horses shall be trapp&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Their harness studded all with gold and pearl.</LINE>
<LINE>Dost thou love hawking? Thou hast hawks will soar</LINE>
<LINE>Above the morning lark. Or wilt thou hunt?</LINE>
<LINE>Thy hounds shall make the welkin answer them</LINE>
<LINE>And fetch shrill echoes from the hollow earth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. SERV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Say thou wilt course, thy greyhounds are as swift</LINE>
<LINE>As breathed stags; ay, fleeter than the roe.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. SERV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Dost thou love pictures? We will fetch thee straight</LINE>
<LINE>Adonis painted by a running brook,</LINE>
<LINE>And Cytherea all in sedges hid,</LINE>
<LINE>Which seem to move and wanton with her breath,</LINE>
<LINE>Even as the waving sedges play with wind.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We&#8217;ll show thee Io as she was a maid,</LINE>
<LINE>And how she was beguiled and surpris&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>As lively painted as the deed was done.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>3. SERV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Or Daphne roaming through a thorny wood,</LINE>
<LINE>Scratching her legs that one shall swear she bleeds,</LINE>
<LINE>And at that sight shall sad Apollo weep,</LINE>
<LINE>So workmanly the blood and tears are drawn.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou art a lord, and nothing but a lord.</LINE>
<LINE>Thou hast a lady far more beautiful</LINE>
<LINE>Than any woman in this waning age.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. SERV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And till the tears that she hath shed for thee</LINE>
<LINE>Like envious floods o&#8217;errun her lovely face,</LINE>
<LINE>She was the fairest creature in the world,</LINE>
<LINE>And yet she is inferior to none.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SLY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Am I a lord, and have I such a lady?</LINE>
<LINE>Or do I dream? Or have I dream&#8217;d till now?</LINE>
<LINE>I do not sleep: I see, I hear, I speak;</LINE>
<LINE>I smell sweet savors, and I feel soft things.</LINE>
<LINE>Upon my life, I am a lord indeed,</LINE>
<LINE>And not a tinker, nor Christopher Sly.</LINE>
<LINE>Well, bring our lady hither to our sight,</LINE>
<LINE>And once again a pot o&#8217; th&#8217; smallest ale.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. SERV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Will&#8217;t please your mightiness to wash your hands?</LINE>
<LINE>O how we joy to see your wit restor&#8217;d!</LINE>
<LINE>O that once more you knew but what you are!</LINE>
<LINE>These fifteen years you have been in a dream,</LINE>
<LINE>Or when you wak&#8217;d, so wak&#8217;d as if you slept.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SLY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>These fifteen years! By my fay, a goodly nap,</LINE>
<LINE>But did I never speak of all that time?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. SERV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O yes, my lord, but very idle words,</LINE>
<LINE>For though you lay here in this goodly chamber,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet would you say ye were beaten out of door,</LINE>
<LINE>And rail upon the hostess of the house,</LINE>
<LINE>And say you would present her at the leet,</LINE>
<LINE>Because she brought stone jugs and no seal&#8217;d quarts.</LINE>
<LINE>Sometimes you would call out for Cicely Hacket.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SLY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, the woman&#8217;s maid of the house.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>3. SERV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, sir, you know no house nor no such maid,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor no such men as you have reckon&#8217;d up,</LINE>
<LINE>As Stephen Sly, and old John Naps of Greece,</LINE>
<LINE>And Peter Turph, and Henry Pimpernell,</LINE>
<LINE>And twenty more such names and men as these,</LINE>
<LINE>Which never were, nor no man ever saw.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SLY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now Lord be thanked for my good amends!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Amen.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter the Page as a lady, with Attendants.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SLY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I thank thee, thou shalt not lose by it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAGE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How fares my noble lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SLY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, I fare well, for here is cheer enough.</LINE>
<LINE>Where is my wife?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAGE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here, noble lord, what is thy will with her?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SLY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Are you my wife and will not call me husband?</LINE>
<LINE>My men should call me &#8220;lord&#8221;; I am your goodman.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAGE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My husband and my lord, my lord and husband,</LINE>
<LINE>I am your wife in all obedience.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SLY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know it well. What must I call her?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Madam.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SLY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Al&#8217;ce madam, or Joan madam?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Madam, and nothing else, so lords call ladies.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SLY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Madam wife, they say that I have dream&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>And slept above some fifteen year or more.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAGE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, and the time seems thirty unto me,</LINE>
<LINE>Being all this time abandon&#8217;d from your bed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SLY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis much. Servants, leave me and her alone.</LINE>
<LINE>Madam, undress you, and come now to bed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAGE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thrice-noble lord, let me entreat of you</LINE>
<LINE>To pardon me yet for a night or two;</LINE>
<LINE>Or if not so, until the sun be set.</LINE>
<LINE>For your physicians have expressly charg&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>In peril to incur your former malady,</LINE>
<LINE>That I should yet absent me from your bed.</LINE>
<LINE>I hope this reason stands for my excuse.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SLY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, it stands so that I may hardly tarry so long. But I would be loath to fall into my dreams again. I will therefore tarry in despite of the flesh and the blood.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter a Messenger.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MESS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your honor&#8217;s players, hearing your amendment,</LINE>
<LINE>Are come to play a pleasant comedy,</LINE>
<LINE>For so your doctors hold it very meet,</LINE>
<LINE>Seeing too much sadness hath congeal&#8217;d your blood,</LINE>
<LINE>And melancholy is the nurse of frenzy.</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore they thought it good you hear a play,</LINE>
<LINE>And frame your mind to mirth and merriment,</LINE>
<LINE>Which bars a thousand harms and lengthens life.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SLY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, I will, let them play it. Is not a comonty a Christmas gambold, or a tumbling-trick?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAGE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, my good lord, it is more pleasing stuff.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SLY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, household stuff?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAGE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is a kind of history.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SLY.</SPEAKER>

<SCENELOCATION>Padua. A public place.</SCENELOCATION>
<SCENEPERSONAE>(Lucentio, Tranio, Baptista, Katherina, Bianca, Gremio, Hortensio, Biondello, Servant, Sly, Page)</SCENEPERSONAE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Lucentio and his man Tranio.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tranio, since for the great desire I had</LINE>
<LINE>To see fair Padua, nursery of arts,</LINE>
<LINE>I am arriv&#8217;d for fruitful Lombardy,</LINE>
<LINE>The pleasant garden of great Italy,</LINE>
<LINE>And by my father&#8217;s love and leave am arm&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>With his good will and thy good company,</LINE>
<LINE>My trusty servant, well approv&#8217;d in all,</LINE>
<LINE>Here let us breathe, and haply institute</LINE>
<LINE>A course of learning and ingenious studies.</LINE>
<LINE>Pisa, renowned for grave citizens,</LINE>
<LINE>Gave me my being and my father first,</LINE>
<LINE>A merchant of great traffic through the world,</LINE>
<LINE>Vincentio, come of the Bentivolii;</LINE>
<LINE>Vincentio&#8217;s son, brought up in Florence,</LINE>
<LINE>It shall become to serve all hopes conceiv&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>To deck his fortune with his virtuous deeds.</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore, Tranio, for the time I study,</LINE>
<LINE>Virtue and that part of philosophy</LINE>
<LINE>Will I apply that treats of happiness</LINE>
<LINE>By virtue specially to be achiev&#8217;d.</LINE>
<LINE>Tell me thy mind, for I have Pisa left</LINE>
<LINE>And am to Padua come, as he that leaves</LINE>
<LINE>A shallow plash to plunge him in the deep,</LINE>
<LINE>And with satiety seeks to quench his thirst.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRA.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Mi perdonato, gentle master mine;</LINE>
<LINE>I am, in all affected as yourself,</LINE>
<LINE>Glad that you thus continue your resolve</LINE>
<LINE>To suck the sweets of sweet philosophy.</LINE>
<LINE>Only, good master, while we do admire</LINE>
<LINE>This virtue and this moral discipline,</LINE>
<LINE>Let&#8217;s be no Stoics nor no stocks, I pray,</LINE>
<LINE>Or so devote to Aristotle&#8217;s checks</LINE>
<LINE>As Ovid be an outcast quite abjur&#8217;d.</LINE>
<LINE>Balk logic with acquaintance that you have,</LINE>
<LINE>And practice rhetoric in your common talk,</LINE>
<LINE>Music and poesy use to quicken you,</LINE>
<LINE>The mathematics, and the metaphysics,</LINE>
<LINE>Fall to them as you find your stomach serves you:</LINE>
<LINE>No profit grows where is no pleasure ta&#8217;en.</LINE>
<LINE>In brief, sir, study what you most affect.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Gramercies, Tranio, well dost thou advise.</LINE>
<LINE>If, Biondello, thou wert come ashore,</LINE>
<LINE>We could at once put us in readiness,</LINE>
<LINE>And take a lodging fit to entertain</LINE>
<LINE>Such friends as time in Padua shall beget.</LINE>
<LINE>But stay a while, what company is this?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRA.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Master, some show to welcome us to town.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Baptista with his two daughters, Katherina and Bianca, Gremio, a pantaloon, Hortensio, suitor to Bianca. Lucentio, Tranio stand by.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Gentlemen, importune me no farther,</LINE>
<LINE>For how I firmly am resolv&#8217;d you know:</LINE>
<LINE>That is, not to bestow my youngest daughter</LINE>
<LINE>Before I have a husband for the elder.</LINE>
<LINE>If either of you both love Katherina,</LINE>
<LINE>Because I know you well, and love you well,</LINE>
<LINE>Leave shall you have to court her at your pleasure.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To cart her rather; she&#8217;s too rough for me.</LINE>
<LINE>There, there, Hortensio, will you any wife?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATH.</SPEAKER>
<STAGEDIR>To Baptista.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>I pray you, sir, is it your will</LINE>
<LINE>To make a stale of me amongst these mates?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Mates, maid, how mean you that? No mates for you,</LINE>
<LINE>Unless you were of gentler, milder mould.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I&#8217; faith, sir, you shall never need to fear.</LINE>
<LINE>Iwis it is not half way to her heart;</LINE>
<LINE>But if it were, doubt not her care should be</LINE>
<LINE>To comb your noddle with a three-legg&#8217;d stool,</LINE>
<LINE>And paint your face, and use you like a fool.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>From all such devils, good Lord deliver us!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And me too, good Lord!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRA.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Husht, master, here&#8217;s some good pastime toward;</LINE>
<LINE>That wench is stark mad or wonderful froward.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But in the other&#8217;s silence do I see</LINE>
<LINE>Maid&#8217;s mild behavior and sobriety.</LINE>
<LINE>Peace, Tranio!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRA.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well said, master, mum, and gaze your fill.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Gentlemen, that I may soon make good</LINE>
<LINE>What I have said, Bianca, get you in,</LINE>
<LINE>And let it not displease thee, good Bianca,</LINE>
<LINE>For I will love thee ne&#8217;er the less, my girl.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A pretty peat! It is best</LINE>
<LINE>Put finger in the eye, and she knew why.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sister, content you in my discontent.</LINE>
<LINE>Sir, to your pleasure humbly I subscribe;</LINE>
<LINE>My books and instruments shall be my company,</LINE>
<LINE>On them to look and practice by myself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hark, Tranio, thou mayst hear Minerva speak.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Signior Baptista, will you be so strange?</LINE>
<LINE>Sorry am I that our good will effects</LINE>
<LINE>Bianca&#8217;s grief.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="3">Why will you mew her up,</LINE>
<LINE>Signior Baptista, for this fiend of hell,</LINE>
<LINE>And make her bear the penance of her tongue?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Gentlemen, content ye; I am resolv&#8217;d.</LINE>
<LINE>Go in, Bianca.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit Bianca.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>And for I know she taketh most delight</LINE>
<LINE>In music, instruments, and poetry,</LINE>
<LINE>Schoolmasters will I keep within my house,</LINE>
<LINE>Fit to instruct her youth. If you, Hortensio,</LINE>
<LINE>Or, Signior Gremio, you, know any such,</LINE>
<LINE>Prefer them hither; for to cunning men</LINE>
<LINE>I will be very kind, and liberal</LINE>
<LINE>To mine own children in good bringing-up,</LINE>
<LINE>And so farewell. Katherina, you may stay,</LINE>
<LINE>For I have more to commune with Bianca.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, and I trust I may go too, may I not?</LINE>
<LINE>What, shall I be appointed hours, as though</LINE>
<LINE>(Belike) I knew not what to take and what to leave? Ha!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You may go to the devil&#8217;s dam; your gifts are so good, here&#8217;s none will hold you. Their love is not so great, Hortensio, but we may blow our nails together, and fast it fairly out. Our cake&#8217;s dough on both sides. Farewell; yet for the love I bear my sweet Bianca, if I can by any means light on a fit man to teach her that wherein she delights, I will wish him to her father.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So will I, Signior Gremio. But a word, I pray. Though the nature of our quarrel yet never brook&#8217;d parle, know now upon advice, it toucheth us both, that we may yet again have access to our fair mistress, and be happy rivals in Bianca&#8217;s love, to labor and effect one thing specially.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What&#8217;s that, I pray?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, sir, to get a husband for her sister.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A husband! A devil.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I say, a husband.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I say, a devil. Think&#8217;st thou, Hortensio, though her father be very rich, any man is so very a fool to be married to hell?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tush, Gremio; though it pass your patience and mine to endure her loud alarums, why, man, there be good fellows in the world, and a man could light on them, would take her with all faults, and money enough.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I cannot tell; but I had as lief take her dowry with this condition: to be whipt at the high cross every morning.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Faith, as you say, there&#8217;s small choice in rotten apples. But come, since this bar in law makes us friends, it shall be so far forth friendly maintain&#8217;d till by helping Baptista&#8217;s eldest daughter to a husband we set his youngest free for a husband, and then have to&#8217;t afresh. Sweet Bianca, happy man be his dole! He that runs fastest gets the ring. How say you, Signior Gremio?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am agreed, and would I had given him the best horse in Padua to begin his wooing that would thoroughly woo her, wed her, and bed her, and rid the house of her! Come on.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt ambo Gremio and Hortensio. Manent Tranio and Lucentio.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRA.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I pray, sir, tell me, is it possible</LINE>
<LINE>That love should of a sudden take such hold?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O Tranio, till I found it to be true,</LINE>
<LINE>I never thought it possible or likely.</LINE>
<LINE>But see, while idly I stood looking on,</LINE>
<LINE>I found the effect of love in idleness,</LINE>
<LINE>And now in plainness do confess to thee,</LINE>
<LINE>That art to me as secret and as dear</LINE>
<LINE>As Anna to the Queen of Carthage was:</LINE>
<LINE>Tranio, I burn, I pine, I perish, Tranio,</LINE>
<LINE>If I achieve not this young modest girl.</LINE>
<LINE>Counsel me, Tranio, for I know thou canst;</LINE>
<LINE>Assist me, Tranio, for I know thou wilt.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRA.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Master, it is no time to chide you now,</LINE>
<LINE>Affection is not rated from the heart.</LINE>
<LINE>If love have touch&#8217;d you, nought remains but so,</LINE>
<LINE><LATIN lang="la">&#8220;Redime te captum quam queas minimo.&#8221;</LATIN></LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Gramercies, lad. Go forward, this contents;</LINE>
<LINE>The rest will comfort, for thy counsel&#8217;s sound.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRA.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Master, you look&#8217;d so longly on the maid,</LINE>
<LINE>Perhaps you mark&#8217;d not what&#8217;s the pith of all.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O yes, I saw sweet beauty in her face,</LINE>
<LINE>Such as the daughter of Agenor had,</LINE>
<LINE>That made great Jove to humble him to her hand,</LINE>
<LINE>When with his knees he kiss&#8217;d the Cretan strond.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRA.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Saw you no more? Mark&#8217;d you not how her sister</LINE>
<LINE>Began to scold, and raise up such a storm</LINE>
<LINE>That mortal ears might hardly endure the din?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tranio, I saw her coral lips to move,</LINE>
<LINE>And with her breath she did perfume the air.</LINE>
<LINE>Sacred and sweet was all I saw in her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRA.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, then &#8217;tis time to stir him from his trance.</LINE>
<LINE>I pray, awake, sir; if you love the maid,</LINE>
<LINE>Bend thoughts and wits to achieve her. Thus it stands:</LINE>
<LINE>Her elder sister is so curst and shrewd</LINE>
<LINE>That till the father rid his hands of her,</LINE>
<LINE>Master, your love must live a maid at home,</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore has he closely mew&#8217;d her up,</LINE>
<LINE>Because she will not be annoy&#8217;d with suitors.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ah, Tranio, what a cruel father&#8217;s he?</LINE>
<LINE>But art thou not advis&#8217;d, he took some care</LINE>
<LINE>To get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRA.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, marry, am I, sir; and now &#8217;tis plotted.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have it, Tranio.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE offset="4">Master, for my hand,</LINE>
<LINE>Both our inventions meet and jump in one.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tell me thine first.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRA.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">You will be schoolmaster,</LINE>
<LINE>And undertake the teaching of the maid:</LINE>
<LINE>That&#8217;s your device.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">It is; may it be done?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRA.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not possible; for who shall bear your part,</LINE>
<LINE>And be in Padua here Vincentio&#8217;s son,</LINE>
<LINE>Keep house and ply his book, welcome his friends,</LINE>
<LINE>Visit his countrymen, and banquet them?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Basta, content thee; for I have it full.</LINE>
<LINE>We have not yet been seen in any house,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor can we be distinguish&#8217;d by our faces</LINE>
<LINE>For man or master. Then it follows thus:</LINE>
<LINE>Thou shalt be master, Tranio, in my stead;</LINE>
<LINE>Keep house and port and servants, as I should.</LINE>
<LINE>I will some other be, some Florentine,</LINE>
<LINE>Some Neapolitan, or meaner man of Pisa.</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis hatch&#8217;d, and shall be so. Tranio, at once</LINE>
<LINE>Uncase thee; take my color&#8217;d hat and cloak.</LINE>
<LINE>When Biondello comes, he waits on thee,</LINE>
<LINE>But I will charm him first to keep his tongue.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRA.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So had you need.</LINE>
<LINE>In brief, sir, sith it your pleasure is,</LINE>
<LINE>And I am tied to be obedient&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>For so your father charg&#8217;d me at our parting;</LINE>
<LINE>&#8220;Be serviceable to my son,&#8221; quoth he,</LINE>
<LINE>Although I think &#8217;twas in another sense&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>I am content to be Lucentio,</LINE>
<LINE>Because so well I love Lucentio.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tranio, be so, because Lucentio loves,</LINE>
<LINE>And let me be a slave, t&#8217; achieve that maid</LINE>
<LINE>Whose sudden sight hath thrall&#8217;d my wounded eye.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter Biondello.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Here comes the rogue. Sirrah, where have you been?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BION.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Where have I been? Nay, how now, where are you? Master, has my fellow Tranio stol&#8217;n your clothes? Or you stol&#8217;n his? Or both? Pray what&#8217;s the news?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sirrah, come hither, &#8217;tis no time to jest,</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore frame your manners to the time.</LINE>
<LINE>Your fellow Tranio here, to save my life,</LINE>
<LINE>Puts my apparel and my count&#8217;nance on,</LINE>
<LINE>And I for my escape have put on his;</LINE>
<LINE>For in a quarrel since I came ashore</LINE>
<LINE>I kill&#8217;d a man, and fear I was descried.</LINE>
<LINE>Wait you on him, I charge you, as becomes,</LINE>
<LINE>While I make way from hence to save my life.</LINE>
<LINE>You understand me?</LINE>

<LINE>So could I, faith, boy, to have the next wish after,</LINE>

<LINE>You use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies.</LINE>
<LINE>When I am alone, why then I am Tranio;</LINE>

<LINE>Nay, &#8217;tis no matter, sir, what he &#8217;leges in Latin. If this be not a lawful cause for me to leave his service, look you, sir. He bid me knock him and rap him soundly, sir.

<LINE>And I have thrust myself into this maze,</LINE>
<LINE>Happily to wive and thrive as best I may.</LINE>
<LINE>Crowns in my purse I have, and goods at home,</LINE>
<LINE>And so am come abroad to see the world.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Petruchio, shall I then come roundly to thee,</LINE>
<LINE>And wish thee to a shrewd ill-favor&#8217;d wife?</LINE>
<LINE>Thou&#8217;dst thank me but a little for my counsel;</LINE>
<LINE>And yet I&#8217;ll promise thee she shall be rich,</LINE>
<LINE>And very rich. But th&#8217; art too much my friend,</LINE>
<LINE>And I&#8217;ll not wish thee to her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PET.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Signior Hortensio, &#8217;twixt such friends as we</LINE>
<LINE>Few words suffice; and therefore, if thou know</LINE>
<LINE>One rich enough to be Petruchio&#8217;s wife</LINE>
<LINE>(As wealth is burden of my wooing dance),</LINE>
<LINE>Be she as foul as was Florentius&#8217; love,</LINE>
<LINE>As old as Sibyl, and as curst and shrewd</LINE>
<LINE>As Socrates&#8217; Xantippe, or a worse,</LINE>
<LINE>She moves me not, or not removes at least</LINE>
<LINE>Affection&#8217;s edge in me. Whe&#8217;er she is as rough</LINE>
<LINE>As are the swelling Adriatic seas,</LINE>
<LINE>I come to wive it wealthily in Padua;</LINE>
<LINE>If wealthily, then happily in Padua.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, look you, sir, he tells you flatly what his mind is. Why, give him gold enough, and marry him to a puppet or an aglet-baby, or an old trot with ne&#8217;er a tooth in her head, though she have as many diseases as two and fifty horses. Why, nothing comes amiss, so money comes withal.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Petruchio, since we are stepp&#8217;d thus far in,</LINE>
<LINE>I will continue that I broach&#8217;d in jest.</LINE>
<LINE>I can, Petruchio, help thee to a wife</LINE>
<LINE>With wealth enough, and young and beauteous,</LINE>
<LINE>Brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman.</LINE>
<LINE>Her only fault, and that is faults enough,</LINE>
<LINE>Is that she is intolerable curst</LINE>
<LINE>And shrewd and froward, so beyond all measure,</LINE>
<LINE>That were my state far worser than it is,</LINE>
<LINE>I would not wed her for a mine of gold.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PET.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hortensio, peace! Thou know&#8217;st not gold&#8217;s effect.</LINE>
<LINE>Tell me her father&#8217;s name, and &#8217;tis enough;</LINE>
<LINE>For I will board her, though she chide as loud</LINE>
<LINE>As thunder when the clouds in autumn crack.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Her father is Baptista Minola,</LINE>
<LINE>An affable and courteous gentleman.</LINE>
<LINE>Her name is Katherina Minola,</LINE>
<LINE>Renown&#8217;d in Padua for her scolding tongue.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PET.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know her father, though I know not her,</LINE>
<LINE>And he knew my deceased father well.</LINE>
<LINE>I will not sleep, Hortensio, till I see her,</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore let me be thus bold with you</LINE>
<LINE>To give you over at this first encounter,</LINE>
<LINE>Unless you will accompany me thither.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I pray you, sir, let him go while the humor lasts. A&#8217; my word, and she knew him as well as I do, she would think scolding would do little good upon him. She may perhaps call him half a score knaves or so. Why, that&#8217;s nothing; and he begin once, he&#8217;ll rail in his rope-tricks. I&#8217;ll tell you what, sir, and she stand him but a little, he will throw a figure in her face, and so disfigure her with it, that she shall have no more eyes to see withal than a cat. You know him not, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tarry, Petruchio, I must go with thee,</LINE>
<LINE>For in Baptista&#8217;s keep my treasure is.</LINE>
<LINE>He hath the jewel of my life in hold,</LINE>
<LINE>His youngest daughter, beautiful Bianca,</LINE>
<LINE>And her withholds from me and other more,</LINE>
<LINE>Suitors to her and rivals in my love;</LINE>
<LINE>Supposing it a thing impossible,</LINE>
<LINE>For those defects I have before rehears&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>That ever Katherina will be woo&#8217;d.</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore this order hath Baptista ta&#8217;en,</LINE>
<LINE>That none shall have access unto Bianca</LINE>
<LINE>Till Katherine the curst have got a husband.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Katherine the curst!</LINE>
<LINE>A title for a maid of all titles the worst.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now shall my friend Petruchio do me grace,</LINE>
<LINE>And offer me disguis&#8217;d in sober robes</LINE>
<LINE>To old Baptista as a schoolmaster</LINE>
<LINE>Well seen in music, to instruct Bianca,</LINE>
<LINE>That so I may by this device at least</LINE>
<LINE>Have leave and leisure to make love to her,</LINE>
<LINE>And unsuspected court her by herself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Gremio, and Lucentio disguised as a schoolmaster.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here&#8217;s no knavery! See, to beguile the old folks, how the young folks lay their heads together! Master, master, look about you! Who goes there? Ha!</LINE>

<LINE>Peace, Grumio, it is the rival of my love. Petruchio, stand by a while.</LINE>

<LINE>All books of love, see that at any hand&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>And see you read no other lectures to her.</LINE>
<LINE>You understand me. Over and beside</LINE>
<LINE>Signior Baptista&#8217;s liberality,</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll mend it with a largess. Take your paper too,</LINE>
<LINE>And let me have them very well perfum&#8217;d;</LINE>
<LINE>For she is sweeter than perfume itself</LINE>
<LINE>To whom they go to. What will you read to her?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What e&#8217;er I read to her, I&#8217;ll plead for you</LINE>
<LINE>As for my patron, stand you so assur&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>As firmly as yourself were still in place,</LINE>
<LINE>Yea, and perhaps with more successful words</LINE>
<LINE>Than you&#8212;unless you were a scholar, sir.</LINE>

<LINE>Have I not in a pitched battle heard</LINE>
<LINE>Loud &#8217;larums, neighing steeds, and trumpets&#8217; clang?</LINE>

<LINE>And were his daughter fairer than she is,</LINE>
<LINE>She may more suitors have, and me for one.</LINE>
<LINE>Fair Leda&#8217;s daughter had a thousand wooers,</LINE>
<LINE>Then well one more may fair Bianca have;</LINE>

<LINE>And will not promise her to any man,</LINE>
<LINE>Until the elder sister first be wed.</LINE>
<LINE>The younger then is free, and not before.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRA.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If it be so, sir, that you are the man</LINE>
<LINE>Must stead us all, and me amongst the rest;</LINE>
<LINE>And if you break the ice, and do this feat,</LINE>
<LINE>Achieve the elder, set the younger free</LINE>
<LINE>For our access&#8212;whose hap shall be to have her</LINE>
<LINE>Will not so graceless be to be ingrate.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PET.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, pardon me, Signior Gremio, I would fain be doing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I doubt it not, sir; but you will curse your wooing.</LINE>
<LINE>Neighbor, this is a gift very grateful, I am sure of it. To express the like kindness, myself, that have been more kindly beholding to you than any, freely give unto you this young scholar,</LINE>

<SPEAKER>BAP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A thousand thanks, Signior Gremio. Welcome, good Cambio.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>To Tranio.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>But, gentle sir, methinks you walk like a stranger. May I be so bold to know the cause of your coming?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRA.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pardon me, sir, the boldness is mine own,</LINE>
<LINE>That being a stranger in this city here,</LINE>
<LINE>Do make myself a suitor to your daughter,</LINE>
<LINE>Unto Bianca, fair and virtuous.</LINE>
<LINE>Nor is your firm resolve unknown to me,</LINE>
<LINE>In the preferment of the eldest sister.</LINE>
<LINE>This liberty is all that I request,</LINE>
<LINE>That upon knowledge of my parentage,</LINE>
<LINE>I may have welcome &#8217;mongst the rest that woo,</LINE>
<LINE>And free access and favor as the rest;</LINE>
<LINE>And toward the education of your daughters,</LINE>
<LINE>I here bestow a simple instrument,</LINE>
<LINE>And this small packet of Greek and Latin books.</LINE>
<LINE>If you accept them, then their worth is great.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>Lucentio is your name, of whence, I pray?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRA.</SPEAKER>

<LINE>Holla, within!</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter a Servant.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE offset="3">Sirrah, lead these gentlemen</LINE>
<LINE>To my daughters, and tell them both,</LINE>
<LINE>These are their tutors. Bid them use them well.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exit Servant with Lucentio and Hortensio, Biondello following.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>We will go walk a little in the orchard,</LINE>
<LINE>And then to dinner. You are passing welcome,</LINE>
<LINE>And so I pray you all to think yourselves.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PET.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Signior Baptista, my business asketh haste,</LINE>
<LINE>And every day I cannot come to woo.</LINE>
<LINE>You knew my father well, and in him me,</LINE>
<LINE>Left soley heir to all his lands and goods,</LINE>
<LINE>Which I have bettered rather than decreas&#8217;d.</LINE>
<LINE>Then tell me, if I get your daughter&#8217;s love,</LINE>
<LINE>What dowry shall I have with her to wife?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>After my death, the one half of my lands,</LINE>
<LINE>And in possession twenty thousand crowns.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PET.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And for that dowry, I&#8217;ll assure her of</LINE>
<LINE>Her widowhood, be it that she survive me,</LINE>
<LINE>In all my lands and leases whatsoever.</LINE>
<LINE>Let specialties be therefore drawn between us,</LINE>
<LINE>That covenants may be kept on either hand.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, when the special thing is well obtain&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>That is, her love; for that is all in all.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PET.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, that is nothing; for I tell you, father,</LINE>
<LINE>I am as peremptory as she proud-minded;</LINE>
<LINE>And where two raging fires meet together,</LINE>
<LINE>They do consume the thing that feeds their fury.</LINE>
<LINE>Though little fire grows great with little wind,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all;</LINE>
<LINE>So I to her, and so she yields to me,</LINE>
<LINE>For I am rough, and woo not like a babe.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well mayst thou woo, and happy be thy speed!</LINE>
<LINE>But be thou arm&#8217;d for some unhappy words.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PET.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, to the proof, as mountains are for winds,</LINE>
<LINE>That shake not, though they blow perpetually.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Hortensio as Litio with his head broke.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How now, my friend, why dost thou look so pale?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For fear, I promise you, if I look pale.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, will my daughter prove a good musician?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I think she&#8217;ll sooner prove a soldier,</LINE>
<LINE>Iron may hold with her, but never lutes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why then thou canst not break her to the lute?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why no, for she hath broke the lute to me.</LINE>
<LINE>I did but tell her she mistook her frets,</LINE>
<LINE>And bow&#8217;d her hand to teach her fingering;</LINE>
<LINE>When, with a most impatient devilish spirit,</LINE>
<LINE>&#8220;Frets, call you these?&#8221; quoth she, &#8220;I&#8217;ll fume with them.&#8221;</LINE>
<LINE>And with that word she strook me on the head,</LINE>
<LINE>And through the instrument my pate made way,</LINE>
<LINE>And there I stood amazed for a while,</LINE>
<LINE>As on a pillory, looking through the lute,</LINE>
<LINE>While she did call me rascal fiddler</LINE>
<LINE>And twangling Jack, with twenty such vild terms,</LINE>
<LINE>As had she studied to misuse me so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PET.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now by the world, it is a lusty wench!</LINE>
<LINE>I love her ten times more than e&#8217;er I did.</LINE>
<LINE>O, how I long to have some chat with her!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, go with me and be not so discomfited.</LINE>
<LINE>Proceed in practice with my younger daughter;</LINE>
<LINE>She&#8217;s apt to learn, and thankful for good turns.</LINE>
<LINE>Signior Petruchio, will you go with us,</LINE>
<LINE>Or shall I send my daughter Kate to you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PET.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I pray you do. I&#8217;ll attend her here,</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exit Baptista with Gremio, Tranio, and Hortensio. Manet Petruchio.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>And woo her with some spirit when she comes.</LINE>
<LINE>Say that she rail, why then I&#8217;ll tell her plain</LINE>
<LINE>She sings as sweetly as a nightingale;</LINE>
<LINE>Say that she frown, I&#8217;ll say she looks as clear</LINE>
<LINE>As morning roses newly wash&#8217;d with dew;</LINE>
<LINE>Say she be mute, and will not speak a word,</LINE>
<LINE>Then I&#8217;ll commend her volubility,</LINE>
<LINE>And say she uttereth piercing eloquence;</LINE>
<LINE>If she do bid me pack, I&#8217;ll give her thanks,</LINE>
<LINE>As though she bid me stay by her a week;</LINE>
<LINE>If she deny to wed, I&#8217;ll crave the day</LINE>
<LINE>When I shall ask the banes, and when be married.</LINE>
<LINE>But here she comes, and now, Petruchio, speak.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Katherina.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Good morrow, Kate, for that&#8217;s your name, I hear.</LINE>

<LINE>Myself am mov&#8217;d to woo thee for my wife.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATH.</SPEAKER>

<LINE>For she&#8217;s not froward, but modest as the dove;</LINE>

<LINE>To speak the ceremonial rites of marriage?</LINE>
<LINE>What says Lucentio to this shame of ours?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No shame but mine. I must forsooth be forc&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>To give my hand oppos&#8217;d against my heart</LINE>
<LINE>Unto a mad-brain rudesby full of spleen,</LINE>
<LINE>Who woo&#8217;d in haste, and means to wed at leisure.</LINE>
<LINE>I told you, I, he was a frantic fool,</LINE>
<LINE>Hiding his bitter jests in blunt behavior;</LINE>
<LINE>And to be noted for a merry man,</LINE>
<LINE>He&#8217;ll woo a thousand, &#8217;point the day of marriage,</LINE>
<LINE>Make friends, invite, and proclaim the banes,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet never means to wed where he hath woo&#8217;d.</LINE>
<LINE>Now must the world point at poor Katherine,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BION.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, Petruchio is coming in a new hat and an old jerkin; a pair of old breeches thrice turn&#8217;d; a pair of boots that have been candle-cases, one buckled, another lac&#8217;d; an old rusty sword ta&#8217;en out of the town armory, with a broken hilt, and chapeless; with two broken points; his horse hipp&#8217;d, with an old mothy saddle and stirrups of no kindred; besides, possess&#8217;d with the glanders and like to mose in the chine, troubled with the lampass, infected with the fashions, full of windgalls, sped with spavins, ray&#8217;d with the yellows, past cure of the fives, stark spoil&#8217;d with the staggers, begnawn with the bots, sway&#8217;d in the back, and shoulder-shotten, near-legg&#8217;d before, and with a half-cheek&#8217;d bit and a head-stall of sheep&#8217;s leather, which being restrain&#8217;d to keep him from stumbling, hath been often burst, and now repair&#8217;d with knots; one girth six times piec&#8217;d, and a woman&#8217;s crupper of velure, which hath two letters for her name fairly set down in studs, and here and there piec&#8217;d with packthread.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BION.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, sir, his lackey, for all the world caparison&#8217;d like the horse; with a linen stock on one leg, and a kersey boot-hose on the other, gart&#8217;red with a red and blue list; an old hat, and the humor of forty fancies prick&#8217;d in&#8217;t for a feather: a monster, a very monster in apparel, and not like a Christian footboy or a gentleman&#8217;s lackey.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRA.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis some odd humor pricks him to this fashion;</LINE>

<LINE>Why, sir, you know this is your wedding-day.</LINE>

<LINE>&#8220;Ay, by gogs-wouns,&#8221; quoth he, and swore so loud,</LINE>
<LINE>That all amaz&#8217;d the priest let fall the book,</LINE>
<LINE>And as he stoop&#8217;d again to take it up,</LINE>
<LINE>This mad-brain&#8217;d bridegroom took him such a cuff</LINE>
<LINE>That down fell priest and book, and book and priest.</LINE>

<LINE>As if the vicar meant to cozen him.</LINE>
<LINE>But after many ceremonies done,</LINE>
<LINE>He calls for wine. &#8220;A health!&#8221; quoth he, as if</LINE>
<LINE>He had been aboard, carousing to his mates</LINE>
<LINE>After a storm, quaff&#8217;d off the muscadel,</LINE>
<LINE>And threw the sops all in the sexton&#8217;s face,</LINE>
<LINE>Having no other reason</LINE>
<LINE>But that his beard grew thin and hungerly,</LINE>
<LINE>And seem&#8217;d to ask him sops as he was drinking.</LINE>
<LINE>This done, he took the bride about the neck,</LINE>
<LINE>And kiss&#8217;d her lips with such a clamorous smack</LINE>
<LINE>That at the parting all the church did echo.</LINE>
<LINE>And I seeing this, came thence for very shame,</LINE>
<LINE>And after me I know the rout is coming.</LINE>
<LINE>Such a mad marriage never was before.</LINE>
<LINE>Hark, hark, I hear the minstrels play.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fie, fie on all tir&#8217;d jades, on all mad masters, and all foul ways! Was ever man so beaten? Was ever man so ray&#8217;d? Was ever man so weary? I am sent before to make a fire, and they are coming after to warm them. Now were not I a little pot and soon hot, my very lips might freeze to my teeth, my tongue to the roof of my mouth, my heart in my belly, ere I should come by a fire to thaw me. But I with blowing the fire shall warm myself; for considering the weather, a taller man than I will take cold. Holla, ho, Curtis!</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CURT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who is that calls so coldly?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>A piece of ice. If thou doubt it, thou mayst slide from my shoulder to my heel with no greater a run but my head and my neck. A fire, good Curtis.</LINE>

<LINE>Away, you three-inch fool! I am no beast.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Am I but three inches? Why, thy horn is a foot, and so long am I at the least. But wilt thou make a fire, or shall I complain on thee to our mistress, whose hand (she being now at hand) thou shalt soon feel, to thy cold comfort, for being slow in thy hot office?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CURT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I prithee, good Grumio, tell me, how goes the world?</LINE>

<LINE>Come, you are so full of cony-catching!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, therefore fire, for I have caught extreme cold. Where&#8217;s the cook? Is supper ready, the house trimm&#8217;d, rushes strew&#8217;d, cobwebs swept, the servingmen in their new fustian, their white stockings, and every officer his wedding garment on? Be the Jacks fair within, the Gills fair without, the carpets laid, and every thing in order?</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tell thou the tale. But hadst thou not cross&#8217;d me, thou shouldst have heard how her horse fell, and she under her horse; thou shouldst have heard in how miry a place, how she was bemoil&#8217;d, how he left her with the horse upon her, how he beat me because her horse stumbled, how she waded through the dirt to pluck him off me; how he swore, how she pray&#8217;d that never pray&#8217;d before; how I cried, how the horses ran away, how her bridle was burst; how I lost my crupper, with many things of worthy memory, which now shall die in oblivion, and thou return unexperienc&#8217;d to thy grave.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CURT.</SPEAKER>

Call forth Nathaniel, Joseph, Nicholas, Philip, Walter, Sugarsop, and the rest; let their heads be slickly comb&#8217;d, their blue coats brush&#8217;d, and their garters of an indifferent knit; let them curtsy with their left legs, and not presume to touch a hair of my master&#8217;s horse-tail till they kiss their hands.

<LINE>Thus have I politicly begun my reign,</LINE>
<LINE>And &#8217;tis my hope to end successfully.</LINE>
<LINE>My falcon now is sharp and passing empty,</LINE>
<LINE>And till she stoop, she must not be full-gorg&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>For then she never looks upon her lure.</LINE>
<LINE>Another way I have to man my haggard,</LINE>
<LINE>To make her come, and know her keeper&#8217;s call,</LINE>
<LINE>That is, to watch her, as we watch these kites</LINE>
<LINE>That bate and beat and will not be obedient.</LINE>
<LINE>She eat no meat today, nor none shall eat;</LINE>
<LINE>Last night she slept not, nor tonight she shall not;</LINE>
<LINE>As with the meat, some undeserved fault</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll find about the making of the bed,</LINE>
<LINE>And here I&#8217;ll fling the pillow, there the bolster,</LINE>
<LINE>This way the coverlet, another way the sheets.</LINE>
<LINE>Ay, and amid this hurly I intend</LINE>
<LINE>That all is done in reverend care of her,</LINE>
<LINE>And in conclusion, she shall watch all night,</LINE>
<LINE>And if she chance to nod I&#8217;ll rail and brawl,</LINE>
<LINE>And with the clamor keep her still awake.</LINE>
<LINE>This is a way to kill a wife with kindness,</LINE>
<LINE>And thus I&#8217;ll curb her mad and headstrong humor.</LINE>
<LINE>He that knows better how to tame a shrew,</LINE>
<LINE>Now let him speak; &#8217;tis charity to shew.</LINE>

<LINE>Sir, at the farthest for a week or two,</LINE>

<LINE>And so to Tripoli, if God lend me life.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Of Mantua, sir? Marry, God forbid!</LINE>
<LINE>And come to Padua, careless of your life?</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PED.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My life, sir? How, I pray? For that goes hard.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRA.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis death for any one in Mantua</LINE>
<LINE>To come to Padua. Know you not the cause?</LINE>
<LINE>Your ships are stay&#8217;d at Venice, and the Duke,</LINE>
<LINE>For private quarrel &#8217;twixt your Duke and him,</LINE>
<LINE>Hath publish&#8217;d and proclaim&#8217;d it openly.</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis marvel, but that you are but newly come,</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PED.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alas, sir, it is worse for me than so,</LINE>

<LINE>Well, sir, to do you courtesy,</LINE>

<LINE>In count&#8217;nance somewhat doth resemble you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BION.</SPEAKER>
<STAGEDIR>Aside.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>As much as an apple doth an oyster, and all one.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRA.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To save your life in this extremity,</LINE>
<LINE>This favor will I do you for his sake;</LINE>
<LINE>And think it not the worst of all your fortunes</LINE>
<LINE>That you are like to Sir Vincentio.</LINE>
<LINE>His name and credit shall you undertake,</LINE>
<LINE>And in my house you shall be friendly lodg&#8217;d.</LINE>
<LINE>Look that you take upon you as you should;</LINE>
<LINE>You understand me, sir? So shall you stay</LINE>
<LINE>Till you have done your business in the city.</LINE>
<LINE>If this be court&#8217;sy, sir, accept of it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PED.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O sir, I do, and will repute you ever</LINE>
<LINE>The patron of my life and liberty.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRA.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then go with me to make the matter good.</LINE>
<LINE>This by the way I let you understand:</LINE>
<LINE>My father is here look&#8217;d for every day,</LINE>
<LINE>To pass assurance of a dow&#8217;r in marriage</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Twixt me and one Baptista&#8217;s daughter here.</LINE>

<LINE>Beggars that come unto my father&#8217;s door</LINE>

<LINE>But I, who never knew how to entreat,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor never needed that I should entreat,</LINE>
<LINE>Am starv&#8217;d for meat, giddy for lack of sleep,</LINE>
<LINE>With oaths kept waking, and with brawling fed;</LINE>
<LINE>And that which spites me more than all these wants,</LINE>
<LINE>He does it under name of perfect love;</LINE>
<LINE>As who should say, if I should sleep or eat,</LINE>

<LINE>Or is the adder better than the eel,</LINE>

<LINE>O no, good Kate; neither art thou the worse</LINE>
<LINE>For this poor furniture and mean array.</LINE>
<LINE>If thou accountedst it shame, lay it on me,</LINE>

<SPEAKER>PED.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Soft, son!</LINE>
<LINE>Sir, by your leave, having come to Padua</LINE>
<LINE>To gather in some debts, my son Lucentio</LINE>
<LINE>Made me acquainted with a weighty cause</LINE>
<LINE>Of love between your daughter and himself;</LINE>
<LINE>And for the good report I hear of you,</LINE>
<LINE>And for the love he beareth to your daughter,</LINE>
<LINE>And she to him, to stay him not too long,</LINE>
<LINE>I am content, in a good father&#8217;s care,</LINE>
<LINE>To have him match&#8217;d; and if you please to like</LINE>
<LINE>No worse than I, upon some agreement</LINE>
<LINE>Me shall you find ready and willing</LINE>
<LINE>With one consent to have her so bestowed;</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, pardon me in what I have to say&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Your plainness and your shortness please me well.</LINE>
<LINE>Right true it is, your son Lucentio here</LINE>
<LINE>Doth love my daughter, and she loveth him,</LINE>
<LINE>Or both dissemble deeply their affections;</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore if you say no more than this,</LINE>
<LINE>That like a father you will deal with him,</LINE>
<LINE>And pass my daughter a sufficient dower,</LINE>
<LINE>The match is made, and all is done:</LINE>
<LINE>Your son shall have my daughter with consent.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>I thank you, sir. Where then do you know best</LINE>

<LINE>Then at my lodging, and it like you.</LINE>
<LINE>There doth my father lie; and there this night</LINE>
<LINE>We&#8217;ll pass the business privately and well.</LINE>
<LINE>Send for your daughter by your servant here;</LINE>
<LINE>My boy shall fetch the scrivener presently.</LINE>
<LINE>The worst is this, that at so slender warning,</LINE>
<LINE>You are like to have a thin and slender pittance.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It likes me well. Cambio, hie you home,</LINE>

<LINE>And so it is; I wonder what it bodes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PET.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, peace it bodes, and love, and quiet life,</LINE>
<LINE>An awe full rule, and right supremacy;</LINE>
<LINE>And to be short, what not, that&#8217;s sweet and happy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now fair befall thee, good Petruchio!</LINE>
<LINE>The wager thou hast won, and I will add</LINE>
<LINE>Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns,</LINE>
<LINE>Another dowry to another daughter,</LINE>
<LINE>For she is chang&#8217;d, as she had never been.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PET.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, I will win my wager better yet,</LINE>
<LINE>And show more sign of her obedience,</LINE>
<LINE>Her new-built virtue and obedience.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Kate, Bianca, and Widow.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>See where she comes, and brings your froward wives</LINE>
<LINE>As prisoners to her womanly persuasion.</LINE>
<LINE>Katherine, that cap of yours becomes you not;</LINE>
<LINE>Off with that bauble, throw it under-foot.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Katherina throws down her cap.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WID.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Lord, let me never have a cause to sigh,</LINE>
<LINE>Till I be brought to such a silly pass!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fie, what a foolish duty call you this?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would your duty were as foolish too.</LINE>
<LINE>The wisdom of your duty, fair Bianca,</LINE>
<LINE>Hath cost me a hundred crowns since supper-time.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The more fool you for laying on my duty.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PET.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Katherine, I charge thee tell these headstrong women</LINE>
<LINE>What duty they do owe their lords and husbands.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WID.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, come, you&#8217;re mocking; we will have no telling.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PET.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come on, I say, and first begin with her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WID.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She shall not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PET.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I say she shall, and first begin with her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fie, fie, unknit that threat&#8217;ning unkind brow,</LINE>
<LINE>And dart not scornful glances from those eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>To wound thy lord, thy king, thy governor.</LINE>
<LINE>It blots thy beauty, as frosts do bite the meads,</LINE>
<LINE>Confounds thy fame, as whirlwinds shake fair buds,</LINE>
<LINE>And in no sense is meet or amiable.</LINE>
<LINE>A woman mov&#8217;d is like a fountain troubled,</LINE>
<LINE>Muddy, ill-seeming, thick, bereft of beauty,</LINE>
<LINE>And while it is so, none so dry or thirsty</LINE>
<LINE>Will deign to sip, or touch one drop of it.</LINE>
<LINE>Thy husband is thy lord, thy life, thy keeper,</LINE>
<LINE>Thy head, thy sovereign; one that cares for thee,</LINE>
<LINE>And for thy maintenance; commits his body</LINE>
<LINE>To painful labor, both by sea and land;</LINE>
<LINE>To watch the night in storms, the day in cold,</LINE>
<LINE>Whilst thou li&#8217;st warm at home, secure and safe;</LINE>
<LINE>And craves no other tribute at thy hands</LINE>
<LINE>But love, fair looks, and true obedience&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Too little payment for so great a debt.</LINE>
<LINE>Such duty as the subject owes the prince,</LINE>
<LINE>Even such a woman oweth to her husband;</LINE>
<LINE>And when she is froward, peevish, sullen, sour,</LINE>
<LINE>And not obedient to his honest will,</LINE>
<LINE>What is she but a foul contending rebel,</LINE>
<LINE>And graceless traitor to her loving lord?</LINE>
<LINE>I am asham&#8217;d that women are so simple</LINE>
<LINE>To offer war where they should kneel for peace,</LINE>
<LINE>Or seek for rule, supremacy, and sway,</LINE>
<LINE>When they are bound to serve, love, and obey.</LINE>
<LINE>Why are our bodies soft, and weak, and smooth,</LINE>
<LINE>Unapt to toil and trouble in the world,</LINE>
<LINE>But that our soft conditions, and our hearts,</LINE>
<LINE>Should well agree with our external parts?</LINE>
<LINE>Come, come, you froward and unable worms!</LINE>
<LINE>My mind hath been as big as one of yours,</LINE>
<LINE>My heart as great, my reason haply more,</LINE>
<LINE>To bandy word for word and frown for frown;</LINE>
<LINE>But now I see our lances are but straws,</LINE>
<LINE>Our strength as weak, our weakness past compare,</LINE>
<LINE>That seeming to be most which we indeed least are.</LINE>
<LINE>Then vail your stomachs, for it is no boot,</LINE>
<LINE>And place your hands below your husband&#8217;s foot;</LINE>
<LINE>In token of which duty, if he please,</LINE>
<LINE>My hand is ready, may it do him ease.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PET.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, there&#8217;s a wench! Come on, and kiss me, Kate.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, go thy ways, old lad, for thou shalt ha&#8217;t.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis a good hearing when children are toward.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But a harsh hearing when women are froward.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PET.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, Kate, we&#8217;ll to bed.</LINE>
<LINE>We three are married, but you two are sped.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>To Lucentio.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>&#8217;Twas I won the wager, though you hit the white,</LINE>
<LINE>And being a winner, God give you good night!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit Petruchio with Katherina.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now go thy ways, thou hast tam&#8217;d a curst shrew.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis a wonder, by your leave, she will be tam&#8217;d so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt.</STAGEDIR>
