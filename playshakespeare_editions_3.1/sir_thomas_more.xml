<personae playtitle="Sir Thomas More">

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="SHREWSBURY.">Earl of Shrewsbury</persname>
<persdescription>The Earl of Shrewsbury is a member of the King&#8217;s Council who grows worried at the rising temper of Londoners against the foreigners. He insists on the seriousness of his fears when Surrey seems likely to dismiss them. He is given the charge of knighting More by the King, to whom he is close. He is an older man. He argues with Rochester and More in the hopes of changing their minds about signing the King&#8217;s articles, and is downcast when they will not.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="SURREY.">Earl of Surrey</persname>
<persdescription>The Earl of Surrey is the youngest member of the King&#8217;s Council, and the first to think of More as a man who might be able to help quell the riot. He does not approve of the actions of the foreigners, and worries about the reactions they may provoke. He does not think much of the intelligence of the lower classes, and they in return do not much like him, and refuse to listen to him when he tries to speak to them. He is a very conservative man, shocked at the concept of rebellion and disobedience to the King, no matter whether it comes from a carpenter or the Lord High Chancellor. Nevertheless, he attempts to save Rochester&#8217;s life, even when the latter continues to refuse to sign the King&#8217;s articles, and wishes More would be less obstinate.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="PALMER.">Sir Thomas Palmer</persname>
<persdescription>Sir Thomas Palmer is a member of the King&#8217;s household. He is concerned about rising feelings against foreigners, and attempts on several occasions to bring the Frenchmen to heel, though to no avail. He raises forces to help the Mayor quell the riots. He later brings the council the articles that the King wishes them to sign. He has prior instructions of what to do with those who refuse to sign, particularly More, and he follows through with these instructions without a fault. He is a widower.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="CHOLMLEY.">Sir Roger Cholmley</persname>
<persdescription>Sir Roger Cholmley is a bold man, willing to tell his superiors to their faces that he believes they are at fault in not telling the King what is going on in the land, particularly in regard to the foreigners. He is among the noblemen leading the King&#8217;s forces to help the Mayor quell the riots.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="MORE.">Sir Thomas More</persname>
<persdescription>Sir Thomas More is an honest, kind and witty man who rises from being a Sheriff of London to Lord High Chancellor (the highest post in the kingdom) before being sent to jail and executed for obeying his conscience rather than the King. A good talker, he is able to calm a riot by using logic and strong imagery on the rioters. He is a great friend of the poor, who adore him as the one man in government who has their interests at heart; people are shocked to discover that he does not take bribes. He is known throughout the world as a wise man, and the just-as-well-known Erasmus is delighted at the opportunity to meet him and talk with him. What is less known is that he is an inveterate practical joker who cannot resist an opportunity for a joke, or for that matter to show off &#8212; even taking a missing actor&#8217;s part in a play and improvising the role. To be fair, as a rule his jokes have a moral point to them. A good family man, he thinks that his wife talks too much, and excludes her by speaking Latin, which the rest of the family understands but she does not. He refuses to blindly sign something the King desires him to, insisting that he may consider the matter first; demoted from his post, and later jailed and condemned to death, he takes this all with great philosophy. He is capable of jesting even on the scaffold. He is an older man, and his beard is rather thin. He is beloved by everybody who knows him for his incomparable moral rectitude.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="LORD MAYOR.">Lord Mayor</persname>
<persdescription>Lord Mayor is in theory the most powerful man in London. He takes his responsibilities seriously, including urging charity to help with the burial of condemned prisoners. He respects More highly and has the good sense to listen to him. The Lord Mayor is rather overwhelmed by the riot and unable to deal with it properly, not being as well-seen by the people as More is. He is deeply grateful to the man, and also deeply loyal to the King.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persname short="MUNDAY.">Sir John Munday</persname>
<persdescription>Sir John Munday tries to quell the rioting apprentices, but merely gets knocked about for his pains.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="SURESBY.">Justice Suresby</persname>
<persdescription>Justice Suresby is a judge with some rather strong opinions. He is quite full of himself and convinced that he knows the causes of all the wrongdoing in the world. In particular, he thinks that if rich people did not carry money on them, they wouldn&#8217;t be robbed. He lacks the sense to be careful when talking with a pickpocket, and ends up the butt of Thomas More&#8217;s point-making practical joke.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persname short="RECORDER.">Recorder</persname>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="ROCHESTER.">Bishop of Rochester</persname>
<persdescription>The Bishop of Rochester (Doctor Fisher) is a member of the King&#8217;s Council. On reading the articles the King wishes him to sign, he instantly refuses, as a matter of conscience.

</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="ROPER.">Roper</persname>
<persdescription>Roper is Sir Thomas&#8217;s son-in-law. He is highly obedient to his father-in-law, and tries to shield his mother-in-law from worries. He worships Sir Thomas, trading Latin tags with him, agreeing with all that he says and always remembering not only More&#8217;s wisdom but the fact that he is known to be wise. He attempts to convince Sir Thomas to sign the King&#8217;s articles with the argument that being More, he could get away with it. More&#8217;s upcoming death brings him to tears.</persdescription>

She is not successful.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="LINCOLN.">John Lincoln</persname>
<persdescription>John Lincoln is a hot-tempered Londoner growing more and more discontented with the abuses of the foreigners. A poor man, he is nevertheless an excellent orator and writer, and spearheads the complaints that result in the rioting. Though he begins reasonably, he quickly becomes a rabble-rousing leader using the most inane of arguments to whip up the xenophobia of his followers. He almost loses control of the mob, but with them he is calmed down by More&#8217;s arguments. A brave man, he accepts the verdict on him, and when he is hanged he jumps from the scaffold rather than having to be pushed.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="GEORGE.">George Betts</persname>
<persdescription>George Betts is the hot-tempered friend of John Lincoln who encourages him to beat up foreigners who are found acting badly in the streets. While Lincoln intends to proceed by open petitions to the Mayor against the foreigners, Betts encourages the idea of direct action, namely rioting on May Day. He proceeds from wanting to beat them to wanting to kill them. Calmed by More&#8217;s words, he is one of those condemned to death but reprieved by the King.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="WILLIAMSON.">Williamson</persname>
<persdescription>Williamson is a London carpenter hard put upon by the foreigners&#8217; actions. Not only does Cavaler steal the pigeons he bought for dinner, but De Barde is intent on carrying off his wife Doll and having his way with her. For that matter, he was once sent to prison for disrespecting a Frenchman. He joins in with the rioting, though he is worried that he and the other leaders might be identified. He is less hot-tempered than his wife, whom he loves dearly and who clearly wears the pants in their relationship. She helps him to face up to his own execution bravely.</persdescription>

Much less well educated than any other member of her family, she cannot speak Latin, leaving her husband able to shut her out from conversation when he thinks she is talking too much. She is either ignorant of theatre, or has no taste for it. She is kept in ignorance by her husband as well as by her children and son-in-law, and is aware of it. She does not take well to More&#8217;s loss of favor, especially the fact that she herself is no longer able to go to court. She is full of fear about More&#8217;s fate, particularly after suffering from a prophetic dream that greatly disturbs her.

When the rioting begins, she dresses herself up in full armor and eggs the others on, mocking her husband for being a wimp. She loves him nonetheless, and wishes to be hanged before he is so that she will not have to see him die. She likes More because of his kindness, honesty, wisdom, and the fact that he gave her brother a job.</persdescription>

<scenepersonae>(John Lincoln, Bettses, Francis de Barde, Doll, Caveler, Williamson, Sherwin)</scenepersonae>
<scenedescription>The foreigner Francis de Barde drags Doll about, insisting on his right to do with her what he pleases, despite her imprecations and raging comments about his treatment of others. Caveler comes in as well, carrying some pigeons he has taken from Williamson. Williamson and others protest, but the self-satisfied Caveler has no patience with them. The grumbling Londoners do not quite dare attack the foreigners, who have friends in high places, but their patience is stretched to the breaking point and their threats do make Caveler and de Barde take off to complain to the ambassador, leaving Doll behind. The Londoners&#8217; simmering rage is encapsulated by John Lincoln, who has written a petition detailing all the wrongs perpetrated by the foreigners, that he intends to have made public. He reads it out, and the emboldened citizens begin to plan a riot to take their revenge.</scenedescription>

<line>Compel me, ye dog&#8217;s face! Thou thinkst thou hast the goldsmith&#8217;s wife in hand, whom thou enticed&#8217;st from her husband with all his plate, and when thou turnd&#8217;st her home to him again, mad&#8217;st him, like an ass, pay for his wife&#8217;s board.</line>

<line>So will I make thy husband too, if please me.</line>

<line>Here he comes himself; tell him so, if thou dar&#8217;st.</line>

<speaker>WILLIAMSON.</speaker>
<line>I bought them in Cheapside, and paid my money for them.</line>

<line>He did, sir, indeed; and you offer him wrong, both to take them from him, and not restore him his money neither.</line>

<speaker>LINCOLN.</speaker>
<line>It is hard when Englishmen&#8217;s patience must be thus jetted on by strangers, and they not dare to revenge their own wrongs.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GEORGE.</speaker>
<line>Lincoln, let&#8217;s beat them down, and bear no more of these abuses.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LINCOLN.</speaker>
<line>We may not, Betts. Be patient, and hear more.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DOLL.</speaker>
<line>How now, husband! What, one stranger take they food from thee, and another thy wife! By our Lady, flesh and blood, I think, can hardly brook that.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LINCOLN.</speaker>
<line>Will this gear never be otherwise? Must these wrongs be thus endured?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GEORGE.</speaker>
<line>Let us step in, and help to revenge their injury.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BARDE.</speaker>
<line>What art thou that talkest of revenge? My lord ambassador shall once more make your Major have a check, if he punish thee for this saucy presumption.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WILLIAMSON.</speaker>
<line>Indeed, my lord Mayor, on the ambassador&#8217;s complaint, sent me to Newgate one day, because (against my will) I took the wall of a stranger. You may do any thing; the goldsmith&#8217;s wife and mine now must be at your commandment.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GEORGE.</speaker>
<line>The more patient fools are ye both, to suffer it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BARDE.</speaker>
<line>Suffer it! Mend it thou or he, if ye can or dare. I tell thee, fellows, and she were the Mayor of London&#8217;s wife, had I her once in my possession, I would keep her in spite of him that durst say nay.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GEORGE.</speaker>
<line>I tell thee, Lombard, these words should cost thy best cape, were I not curbed by duty and obedience. The Mayor of London&#8217;s wife! Oh God, shall it be thus?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DOLL.</speaker>
<line>Why, Betts, am not I as dear to my husband as my lord Mayor&#8217;s wife to him? And wilt thou so neglectly suffer thine own shame?&#8212;Hands off, proud stranger! Or, by him that bought me, if men&#8217;s milky hearts dare not strike a stranger, yet women beat them down, ere they bear these abuses.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>BARDE.</speaker>
<line>Mistress, I say you shall along with me.</line>

If our husbands must be bridled by law, and forced to bear your wrongs, their wives will be a little lawless, and soundly beat ye.</line>

<stagedir type="exit">Exeunt Ambo.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>DOLL.</speaker>
<line>Aye, go, and send him among us, and we&#8217;ll give him his welcome too. I am ashamed that freeborn Englishmen, having beaten strangers within their own homes, should thus be braved and abused by them at home.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SHERWIN.</speaker>
<line>It is not our lack of courage in the cause, but the strict obedience that we are bound to. I am the goldsmith whose wrongs you talked of; but how to redress yours or mine own is a matter beyond our abilities.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LINCOLN.</speaker>
<line>Not so, not so, my good friends. I, though a mean man, a broker by profession, and named John Lincoln, have long time winked at these wild enormities with mighty impatience, and, as these two brethren here (Betts by name) can witness, with loss of mine own life would gladly remedy them.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GEORGE.</speaker>
<line>And he is in a good forwardness, I tell ye, if all hit right.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DOLL.</speaker>
<line>As how, I prithee? Tell it to Doll Williamson.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LINCOLN.</speaker>
<line>You know the Spittle sermons begin the next week. I have drawn a bill of our wrongs and the strangers&#8217; insolences.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GEORGE.</speaker>
<line>Which he means the preachers shall there openly publish in the pulpit.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WILLIAMSON.</speaker>
<line>Oh, but that they would! I&#8217;faith, it would tickle our strangers thoroughly.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DOLL.</speaker>
<line>Aye, and if you men durst not undertake it, before God, we women would. Take an honest woman from her husband! Why, it is intolerable.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SHERWIN.</speaker>
<line>But how find ye the preachers affected to our proceeding?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LINCOLN.</speaker>
<line>Master Doctor Standish hath answered that it becomes not him to move any such thing in his sermon, and tells us we must move the Mayor and aldermen to reform it, and doubts not but happy success will ensue on statement of our wrongs. You shall perceive there&#8217;s no hurt in the bill. Here&#8217;s a couple of it; I pray ye, hear it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ALL.</speaker>
<line>With all our hearts; for God&#8217;s sake, read it.</line>

<stagedir type="read">Reads.</stagedir>
<line><recite>&#8220;To you all, the worshipful lords and masters of this city, that will take compassion over the poor people your neighbors, and also of the great importable hurts, losses, and hinderances, whereof proceedeth extreme poverty to all the king&#8217;s subjects that inhabit within this city and suburbs of the same. For so it is that aliens and strangers eat the bread from the fatherless children, and take the living from all the artificers and the intercourse from all the merchants, whereby poverty is so much increased, that every man bewaileth the misery of other; for craftsmen be brought to beggary, and merchants to neediness. Wherefore, the premises considered, the redress must be of the common knit and united to one part. And as the hurt and damage grieveth all men, so must all men see to their willing power for remedy, and not suffer the said aliens in their wealth, and the natural born men of this region to come to confusion.&#8221;</recite></line>

<speech>
<speaker>DOLL.</speaker>
<line>Before God, &#8217;tis excellent; and I&#8217;ll maintain the suit to be honest.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SHERWIN.</speaker>
<line>Well, say &#8217;tis read, what is your further meaning in the matter?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GEORGE.</speaker>
<line>What? Marry, list to me. No doubt but this will store us with friends enow, whose names we will closely keep in writing; and on May day next in the morning we&#8217;ll go forth a Maying, but make it the worst May day for the strangers that ever they saw. How say ye? Do ye subscribe, or are ye faint-hearted revolters?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DOLL.</speaker>
<line>Hold thee, George Betts, there&#8217;s my hand and my heart. By the Lord, I&#8217;ll make a captain among ye, and do somewhat to be talk of forever after.</line>
</speech>

<scenelocation>London. The Sessions House.</scenelocation>
<scenepersonae>(Lord Mayor, Justice Suresby, Justices, Sheriff More, Sheriff, Smart, Lifter, Recorder, Officers)</scenepersonae>
<scenedescription>The judges have finished their grave business for the day and turn their attention to pettier crimes, specifically the judging of a pickpocket. Suresby takes exception, blaming the plaintiff for being foolish enough to carry ten pounds on him and brag about the fact. He suggests that the plaintiff deserves to be fined as much again to teach him to be more cautious. Sheriff More ask to be left with the prisoner, and the other judges agree. More proposes a bargain with the prisoner: if he manages to pick Suresby&#8217;s pocket, More will make sure he is pardoned. The pickpocket agrees, though he is a bit worried. More says that he will send Suresby in on his own, and warns the pickpocket not to steal any of the money for himself. More goes out and Suresby replaces him. As Lifter mumbles inconsequential matters, he manages to steal Suresby&#8217;s purse. As the Lord Mayor and other judges return, Suresby continues to claim that people have their purses stolen through their own negligence. The judges condemn the pickpocket to death, and, as is the custom, make a charitable donation towards burying him once he has been hanged. Suresby discovers that his pocket has been picked, and after he protests a little More mocks him for being foolish enough to carry money around in his pocket, until Suresby realizes who is behind his loss. More gives him back his purse.</scenedescription>

<line>My lord, he stands indicted for a purse;</line>

<speech>

<line>Who sent him in?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SURESBY.</speaker>
<line offset="4">That did I, my lord:</line>

<line>What is his name?</line>

<speaker>LORD MAYOR.</speaker>
<line>Good Master Justice Suresby, speak your mind;</line>
<line>We are well pleased to give you audience.</line>

<line>Hear me, Smart; thou art a foolish fellow:</line>
<line>If Lifter be convicted by the law,</line>

<line>I&#8217;ll stand too &#8217;t thou art guilty of his death.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>SURESBY.</speaker>
<line>I tell thee plain, it is a shame for thee,</line>
<line>With such a sum to tempt necessity;</line>
<line>No less than ten pounds, sir, will serve your turn,</line>
<line>To carry in your purse about with ye,</line>
<line>To crake and brag in taverns of your money:</line>
<line>I promise ye, a man that goes abroad</line>
<line>With an intent of truth, meeting such a booty,</line>
<line>May be provoked to that he never meant.</line>
<line>What makes so many pilferers and felons,</line>
<line>But such fond baits that foolish people lay</line>
<line>To tempt the needy miserable wretch?</line>
<line>Ten pounds, odd money; this is a pretty sum</line>
<line>To bear about, which were more safe at home.</line>

<line>Sirrah, you know that you are known to me,</line>

<line>That Justice Suresby is thy heavy friend,</line>
<line>By all the blame that he pretends to Smart,</line>
<line>For tempting thee with such a sum of money.</line>
<line>I tell thee what; devise me but a means</line>
<line>To pick or cut his purse, and, on my credit,</line>

<line>Good Master Sheriff, seek not my overthrow:</line>

<line>Thou much mistak&#8217;st me. And, for thou shall not think</line>

<line>I will maintain the act when thou hast done it.</line>
<line>Thou knowest there are such matters in my hands,</line>
<line>As if I pleased to give them to the jury,</line>
<line>I should not need this way to circumvent thee.</line>
<line>All that I aim at is a merry jest:</line>

<line>What makes so many pilferers and felons,</line>

<scenedescription>Shrewsbury, Surrey and Palmer discuss the current situation, which is worrying: something is clearly brewing among the citizens of London against the foreigners. They make it clear that they are aware that the foreigners are to blame. Chomley suggests that they are to blame for not letting the King know of these matters. A messenger enters with the news that their worst fears are true: the citizens are rioting, even threatening the Lord Mayor&#8217;s house. The noblemen decide to ride to his rescue, and Surrey suggests that they ask Sheriff More to talk to the rioters, as the people respect him.</scenedescription>

<scenedescription>Lincoln rants to the rioters about foreign habits infecting the English. The Lord Mayor, Shrewsbury, Surrey and More arrive and attempt to speak to the rioters. After some confusion they agree to listen to More. The Sheriff paints them a picture of the foreigners being driven from the land and asks them to imagine themselves in their place, and points out that if they succeed, all they will have done is validate anarchy, and therefore put themselves at risk. Beyond that, he accuses them of rising up against God Himself by going against the King, points out that the King would be within his rights to banish them, and asks them where they could go as refugees, if they treat refugees with so little pity in England. The rioters are convinced, and agree to yield if More will intercede with the King for their pardon. They are all taken away to various prisons to wait for the King&#8217;s sentence on them. Shrewsbury goes to tell the King the news. Lincoln and Doll bid farewell to More, holding him to his promise to obtain their pardon. The Mayor congratulates the Sheriff, and he and More make arrangements for keeping the peace over the net night. Shrewsbury returns with news from the King, and knights More, now Sir Thomas, in recompense. What&#8217;s more, the King has named More to the Privy Council. More is somewhat overwhelmed. As the Mayor is commanded to make a report of all that has occurred for the King&#8217;s sake, More and Shrewsbury leave for court.</scenedescription>

<line>Trash, trash; they breed sore eyes, and &#8217;tis enough to infect the city with the palsey.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LINCOLN.</speaker>
<line>Nay, it has infected it with the palsey; for these bastards of dung, as you know they grow in dung, have infected us, and it is our infection will make the city shake, which partly comes through the eating of parsnips.</line>

<line>Plodding tooth ports and costs for transportation,</line>
<line>And that you sit as kings in your desires,</line>
<line>Authority quite silent by your brawl,</line>
<line>And you in ruff of your opinions clothed;</line>
<line>What had you got? I&#8217;ll tell you. You had taught</line>
<line>How insolence and strong hand should prevail,</line>
<line>How order should be quelled; and by this pattern</line>
<line>Not one of you should live an aged man,</line>
<line>For other ruffians, as their fancies wrought,</line>

<line>Let me set up before your thoughts, good friends,</line>
<line>On supposition; which if you will mark,</line>
<line>You shall perceive how horrible a shape</line>
<line>Your innovation bears. First, &#8217;tis a sin</line>
<line>Which oft the apostle did forewarn us of,</line>
<line>Urging obedience to authority;</line>
<line>And &#8217;twere no error, if I told you all,</line>
<line>You were in arms against your God himself.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ALL.</speaker>
<line>Marry, God forbid that!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Nay, certainly you are;</line>
<line>For to the king God hath his office lent</line>
<line>Of dread, of justice, power and command,</line>
<line>Hath bid him rule, and willed you to obey;</line>
<line>And, to add ampler majesty to this,</line>
<line>He hath not only lent the king his figure,</line>
<line>His throne and sword, but given him his own name,</line>
<line>Calls him a god on earth. What do you, then,</line>
<line>Rising &#8217;gainst him that God himself installs,</line>
<line>But rise against God? What do you to your souls</line>
<line>In doing this? O, desperate as you are,</line>
<line>Wash your foul minds with tears, and those same hands,</line>
<line>That you like rebels lift against the peace,</line>
<line>Lift up for peace, and your unreverent knees,</line>
<line>Make them your feet to kneel to be forgiven!</line>
<line>Tell me but this. What rebel captain,</line>
<line>As mutinies are incident, by his name</line>
<line>Can still the rout? Who will obey a traitor?</line>
<line>Or how can well that proclamation sound,</line>
<line>When there is no addition but a rebel</line>
<line>To qualify a rebel? You&#8217;ll put down strangers,</line>
<line>Kill them, cut their throats, possess their houses,</line>
<line>And lead the majesty of law in line,</line>
<line>To slip him like a hound. Say now the king</line>
<line>(As he is clement, if th&#8217; offender mourn)</line>
<line>Should so much come to short of your great trespass</line>
<line>As but to banish you, whether would you go?</line>
<line>What country, by the nature of your error,</line>
<line>Should give you harbor? Go you to France or Flanders,</line>
<line>To any German province, to Spain or Portugal,</line>
<line>Nay, any where that not adheres to England,&#8212;</line>
<line>Why, you must needs be strangers. Would you be pleased</line>
<line>To find a nation of such barbarous temper,</line>
<line>That, breaking out in hideous violence,</line>
<line>Would not afford you an abode on earth,</line>
<line>Whet their detested knives against your throats,</line>
<line>Spurn you like dogs, and like as if that God</line>
<line>Owed not nor made not you, nor that the claimants</line>
<line>Were not all appropriate to your comforts,</line>
<line>But chartered unto them, what would you think</line>
<line>To be thus used? This is the strangers&#8217; case;</line>

<line>Think, God hath made weak More his instrument</line>
<line>To thwart sedition&#8217;s violent intent.</line>
<line>I think &#8217;twere best, my lord, some two hours hence</line>

<scenelocation>Cheapside.</scenelocation>
<scenepersonae>(Master Sheriff, Messenger, Officers, Lincoln, Doll, Clown, Williamson, Earl of Surrey)</scenepersonae>
<scenedescription>A Sheriff is ordered to set up a gibbet here in Cheapside so that some of the rioters may be hanged there as well as at Tyburn – specifically, Lincoln and his fellow leaders. There are so many people crowding the street that it is difficult to get the condemned to the gallows. The Sheriff orders Lincoln to be hanged first; he accepts it as his due. Climbing the ladder, he makes a brave farewell speech protesting his loyalty to the King; then without needing to be pushed he jumps off himself and hangs. The Sheriff orders Williamson to be brought up next, but Doll begs to be hanged before her husband. She complains that More has not kept his word about obtaining their pardons. As she bravely bids farewell to all her friends, Surrey enters in a rush to announce that they have all been spared death, even Lincoln. Alas, it is too late to save Lincoln, but the others have been spared at More&#8217;s entreaty, who has been made Lord High Chancellor of England. Surrey lectures the pardoned rioters about the King&#8217;s goodness, and they all cheer the King, Surrey, and More.</scenedescription>

<line>Let me die next, sir; that is all I crave:</line>
<line>You know not what a comfort you shall bring</line>

<speaker>1. SHERIFF.</speaker>
<line>Bring her to death; she shall have her desire.</line>

<speaker>CLOWN.</speaker>
<line>Sir, and I have a suit for you too.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. SHERIFF.</speaker>
<line>What is it?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CLOWN.</speaker>
<line>That, as you have hanged Lincoln first, and will hang her next, so you will not hang me at all.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. SHERIFF.</speaker>
<line>Nay, you set ope&#8217; the Counter gates, and you must hang for the folly.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CLOWN.</speaker>
<line>Well, then, so much for it!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DOLL.</speaker>
<line>Sir, your free bounty much contents my mind.</line>
<line>Commend me to that good Sheriff Master More,</line>
<line>And tell him, had&#8217;t not been for his persuasion,</line>
<line>John Lincoln had not hung here as he does:</line>
<line>We would first have locked us up in Leadenhall,</line>
<line>And there been burnt to ashes with the roof.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. SHERIFF.</speaker>
<line>Woman, what Master More did was a subject&#8217;s duty,</line>
<line>And hath so pleased our gracious lord the king,</line>
<line>That he is hence removed to higher place,</line>
<line>And made of council to his majesty.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DOLL.</speaker>
<line>Well is he worthy of it, by my troth,</line>
<line>An honest, wise, well-spoken gentleman;</line>
<line>Yet would I praise his honesty much more,</line>
<line>If he had kept his word, and saved our lives:</line>
<line>But let that pass; men are but men, and so</line>
<line>Words are but words, and pays not what men owe.</line>
<line>You, husband, since perhaps the world may say</line>
<line>That through my means thou comest thus to thy end,</line>
<line>Here I begin this cup of death to thee,</line>
<line>Because thou shalt be sure to taste no worse</line>
<line>Than I have taken that must go before thee.</line>
<line>What though I be a woman? That&#8217;s no matter;</line>
<line>I do owe God a death, and I must pay him.</line>
<line>Husband, give me thy hand; be not dismayed;</line>
<line>This chair being chaired, then all our debt is paid.</line>
<line>Only two little babes we leave behind us,</line>
<line>And all I can bequeath them at this time</line>
<line>Is but the love of some good honest friend,</line>
<line>To bring them up in charitable sort:</line>
<line>What, masters! He goes upright that never halts,</line>
<line>And they may live to mend their parents&#8217; faults.</line>

<speaker>WILLIAMSON.</speaker>
<line>Why, well said, wife; i&#8217;faith, thou cheerest my heart:</line>

<line>The next kiss, Williamson, shall be in heaven.</line>
<line>Now cheerily, lads! George Betts, a hand with thee;</line>
<line>And thine too, Rafe, and thine, good honest Sherwin.</line>
<line>Now let me tell the women of this town,</line>
<line>No stranger yet brought Doll to lying down:</line>
<line>So long as I an Englishman can see,</line>
<line>Nor French nor Dutch shall get a kiss of me;</line>
<line>And when that I am dead, for me yet say,</line>
<line>I died in scorn to be a stranger&#8217;s prey.</line>

<scenelocation>Chelsea. A room in More&#8217;s house.</scenelocation>
<scenepersonae>(Sir Thomas More, Randall, Sheriff, Faulkner, Officers, Surrey, Erasmus, Attendants, Master Morris)</scenepersonae>
<scenedescription>More reflects on his unexpected rise from commoner to the highest position in the land under the King, and reminds himself not to become too proud. He has invited the well-known scholar Erasmus to visit, and decides to play a prank on him: he has his servant Randall dress up in his clothes and pretend to be him. More warns Randall not too say too much in case that gives the trick away. The Sherriff brings in a long-haired, long-bearded ruffian named Faulkner, who has refused to be judged by anyone other than More. Discovering that he serves the secretary of the Bishop of Winchester, the irritated More promises him his freedom if he&#8217;ll cut his hair. Faulkner absolutely refuses, and More packs him off to Newgate prison for either three years or a month, depending on whether he changes his mind or not. Erasmus then arrives, accompanied by Surrey, who praises More to his visitor. Randall overplays his part a little, to Erasmus&#8217;s shock; still, when Randall begins to spew out anti-Dutch jokes, More decides that things have gone far, and appears to take back his rightful place. He excuses his joke by saying that it was a demonstration of a philosophical point. Erasmus professes to be amused. More mentions that Surrey is a poet, to the latter&#8217;s protest that this makes him seem a light-minded fool, but More consoles him. He sends Surrey and Erasmus off to dinner, when Master Morris, the Bishop of Winchester&#8217;s secretary, arrives to plead for Faulkner. When More hears that Faulkner has had his hair cut, he agrees to free the lout. Faulkner bemoans the loss of his hair, to Morris&#8217;s disgust, but despite the latter&#8217;s threats of dismissing him, he keeps his job.</scenedescription>

<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>It is in heaven that I am thus and thus;</line>
<line>And that which we profanely term our fortunes</line>
<line>Is the provision of the power above,</line>
<line>Fitted and shaped just to that strength of nature</line>
<line>Which we are borne withal. Good God, good God,</line>
<line>That I from such an humble bench of birth</line>
<line>Should step as &#8217;twere up to my country&#8217;s head,</line>
<line>And give the law out there! I, in my father&#8217;s life,</line>
<line>To take prerogative and tithe of knees</line>
<line>From elder kinsmen, and him bind by my place</line>
<line>To give the smooth and dexter way to me</line>
<line>That owe it him by nature! Sure, these things,</line>
<line>Not physicked by respect, might turn our blood</line>
<line>To much corruption. But, More, the more thou hast,</line>
<line>Either of honor, office, wealth, and calling,</line>
<line>Which might excite thee to embrace and hub them,</line>
<line>The more doe thou in serpents&#8217; natures think them;</line>
<line>Fear their gay skins with thought of their sharp state;</line>
<line>And let this be thy maxim, to be great</line>
<line>Is when the thread of hayday is once &#8217;spon,</line>

<line>Yes, my lord, I stand but on a few points; I shall have done</line>

<line>&#8217;Tis fit thou shouldst wax proud, or else thou&#8217;lt ne&#8217;er</line>

<line>The learned clark Erasmus is arrived</line>
<line>Within our English court. Last night I hear</line>
<line>He feasted with our honored English poet,</line>
<line>The Earl of Surrey; and I learned today</line>
<line>The famous clark of Rotterdam will visit</line>
<line>Sir Thomas More. Therefore, sir, take my seat;</line>
<line>You are Lord Chancellor. Dress your behavior</line>
<line>According to my carriage; but beware</line>
<line>You talk not over much, for twill betray thee:</line>
<line>Who prates not much seems wise; his wit few scan;</line>
<line>While the tongue blabs tales of the imperfect man.</line>

<line>There was a fray in Paternoster-row, and because they would not be parted, the street was choked up with carts.</line>

<line>This fellow was a principal broacher of the broil.</line>

<speaker>FAULKNER.</speaker>
<line>I hope so, my lord. The fray was between the Bishops&#8217; men of Ely and Winchester; and I could not in honor but part them. I thought it stood not with my reputation and degree to come to my questions and answers before a city justice. I knew I should to the pot.</line>

<line>My lord, Jack Faulkner tells no Aesop&#8217;s fables. Troth, I was not at barber&#8217;s this three years; I have not been cut not will not be cut, upon a foolish vow, which, as the Destinies shall direct, I am sworn to keep.</line>

<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Vows are recorded in the court of Heaven,</line>
<line>For they are holy acts. Young man, I charge thee</line>
<line>And do advise thee, start not from that vow:</line>
<line>And, for I will be sure thou shalt not shear,</line>
<line>Besides, because it is an odious sight</line>

<line>Come to me three years hence, and then I&#8217;ll hear you.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>MORRIS.</speaker>
<line>I understand your honor. But the foolish knave has submitted</line>
<line>Himself to the mercy of a barber, and is without, ready to make a</line>
<line>New vow before your lordship, hereafter to leave cavil.</line>

<line>No, my lord; lost all that ever God sent me.</line>

<line>With a short hair. How quickly are three years</line>

<line>I think so, my lord; for there was but a hair&#8217;s length between my going thither and so long time.</line>

<line>Because I see some grace in thee, go free.</line>

<line>Did not I tell thee always of these locks?</line>

<line>And the locks were on again, all the goldsmiths in Cheapside should not pick them open. &#8217;Sheart, if my hair stand not on end when I look for my face in a glass, I am a polecat. Here&#8217;s a lousy jest! But, if I notch not that rogue Tom Barber, that makes me look thus like a Brownist, hang me! I&#8217;ll be worse to the nittical knave than ten tooth-drawings.

<line>Because I&#8217;m an ass. Do you set your shavers upon me, and then cast me off? Must I condole? Have the Fates played the fools? Am I their cut? Now the poor sconce is taken, must Jack march with bag and baggage?</line>

<scenedescription>More bustles about getting things ready for the dessert course. He is told that some players have come to offer their services, and More receives their leader. He chooses The Marriage of Wit and Wisdom from their selection of potential plays. More&#8217;s guests arrive in the chamber, and they all trade compliments. As they sit and wait for the play to begin, however, More is called over by one of the players who asks if they can wait a little longer, as they are lacking a false beard, which one of them has gone to fetch. More tells them to start anyway, certain that the fellow bringing the beard will return in time for his scenes. The play begins and goes well enough, until they reach the scene needing both beard and player. Seeing an opportunity, More stands up and takes on the role himself, improvising until the last player returns. By now, however, it&#8217;s time for dessert, so More dismisses the players. He sends a servant to pay them extremely well. More returns in haste, having been sent for to go to the Council immediately, and learns in passing that the servant tried to cheat the players. The servant tries to excuse himself by claiming he didn&#8217;t have enough money to give them the full sum, but More disbelieves him, realizing he hoped to keep the extra money for himself, and fires him. The players praise him.</scenedescription>

<line>Then there&#8217;s no wit in &#8217;t, I&#8217;ll be sworn. Folly waits on wit, as the shadow on the body, and where wit is ripest there folly still is readiest. But begin, I prithee. We&#8217;ll rather allow a beardless Wit than Wit all beard to have no brain.</line>

<scenedescription>More is late for the Council meeting, but arrives just as the other councilors are on the verge of having him sent for. They settle down to consider whether England should make an alliance with the German emperor. There is some disagreement on the matter, but More votes that they should. Palmer brings in a list of articles from the King, which all of the councilors are required to agree to and sign. More recommends reading them before agreeing, and passes them to the Bishop of Rochester, who is horrified at the contents and refuses to sign. Palmer arrests him for it. More asks for some time to consider the matter, and resigns the chancellorship for the duration; he is ordered to confine himself to his house at Chelsea. More invites any of the nobles to come visit him for some fishing, and leaves. The others all sign, and are convinced that both the Bishop and More will soon change their minds.</scenedescription>

<line>About the entertainment of the Emperor</line>

<speech>
<speaker>SURREY.</speaker>
<line>My lords, as &#8217;tis the custom in this place</line>
<line>The youngest should speak first, so, if I chance</line>
<line>In this case to speak youngly, pardon me.</line>
<line>I will agree, France now hath her full strength,</line>
<line>As having new recovered the pale blood</line>
<line>Which war sluiced forth; and I consent to this,</line>
<line>That the conjunction of our English forces</line>
<line>With arms of Germany may soon bring</line>
<line>This prize of conquest in. But, then, my lords,</line>
<line>As in the moral hunting &#8217;twixt the lion</line>
<line>And other beasts, force joined with greed</line>
<line>Frighted the weaker sharers from their parts;</line>
<line>So, if the empire&#8217;s sovereign chance to put</line>
<line>His plea of partnership into war&#8217;s court,</line>
<line>Swords should decide the difference, and our blood</line>
<line>In private tears lament his entertainment.</line>

<speaker>SHREWSBURY.</speaker>
<line>To doubt the worst is still the wise man&#8217;s shield,</line>

<line>The Emperor is a man of royal faith;</line>
<line>His love unto our sovereign brings him down</line>
<line>From his imperial seat, to march in pay</line>
<line>Under our English flag, and wear the cross,</line>
<line>Like some high order, on his manly breast;</line>
<line>Thus serving, he&#8217;s not master of himself,</line>
<line>But, like a colonel commanding other,</line>
<line>Is by the general over-awed himself.</line>

<line>Yet, my good lord&#8212;</line>

<line>As subjects share no portion in the conquest</line>
<line>Of their true sovereign, other than the merit</line>
<line>That from the sovereign guerdons the true subject;</line>

<line>We had ten thousand of such able men!</line>
<line>Hah, then there would appear no court, no city,</line>

More bids her be quiet and refuses to listen to her. Roper reminds him that all the family rises or falls with him. More insists that they are much better off now, especially as they are no longer in a position to be corrupted. Surrey and Shrewsbury arrive, clearly unhappy, to request once again that More sign the articles. They inform him that Rochester is in the Tower and that if More does not sign, he too will suffer a harsher imprisonment. Lady More and the daughters go into hysterics. More agrees to pleas the King, and everyone is overjoyed, but More explains that he means to agree to go to the Tower, rather than agreeing to sign. He is officially arrested for high treason. More says farewell to his family, his servants and his house, and leaves for prison, ready for his own death.</scenedescription>

<line>If man himself be subject to such ruin,</line>

<line>Nature provides content for the base mind;</line>

<line>Their low-wrought bodies drudge in patience;</line>
<line>As for the prince in all his sweet-gorged maw,</line>

<line>The noon&#8217;s excess in the night&#8217;s dangerous surfeits.</line>
<line>What means or misery from our birth doth flow</line>
<line>Nature entitles to us; that we owe:</line>

<scenedescription>The Lieutenant of the Tower tells More that the warrant for his execution has arrived, and that he is to die the next morning. Even now, More manages to joke, commenting on how he no longer needs to fear for his health nor need to bother (or pay) a doctor. Asking about Rochester, he is told that the Bishop was executed the day before. The Lieutenant is shocked to discover that More was an honest Chancellor, never taking bribes, and that he is therefore excessively poor. More&#8217;s family comes to say farewell, and he points out to them how much better circumstances are now than when he was Chancellor: he is not too busy to receive them. They beg him to give in, insisting that the King will pardon him if he only submits, even this late, but he is obdurate and will not. He gives his family one last homily, and blesses them, before they are forced to leave.</scenedescription>

More even recognizes one of them from his student days. He mounts the scaffold, still managing to make bad puns as he goes. Surrey and Shrewsbury arrive to take their leave of him, and to convince him to give a goodbye speech admitting his faults. As he gives his coat to the hangman, More continues to joke. The hangman begs forgiveness, and More tells him that he shouldn&#8217;t giving him his purse and asking only that he be quick. Though it is clear that there is no escape from the cordon of guards, More comments that he shall nevertheless escape through the airs when his soul leaves for heaven.

<line>In sooth, I am come about a headless errand,</line>
<line>For I have not much to say, now I am here.</line>
<line>Well, let&#8217;s ascend, i&#8217;God&#8217;s name:</line>
<line>In troth, methinks, your stair is somewhat weak;</line>
<line>I prithee, honest friend, lend me thy hand</line>
<line>To help me up; as for my coming down,</line>
<line>Let me alone, I&#8217;ll look to that myself.</line>
<stagedir type="action">As he is going up the stairs, enters the Earls of Surrey and Shrewsbury.</stagedir>
<line>My Lords of Surrey and Shrewsbury, give me your hands. Yet before we...ye see, though it pleaseth the king to raise me thus high, yet I am not proud, for the higher I mount, the better I can see my friends about me. I am now on a far voyage, and this strange wooden horse must bear me thither; yet I perceive by your looks you like my bargain so ill, that there&#8217;s not one of ye all dare enter with me. Truly, here&#8217;s a most sweet gallery;</line>
<stagedir type="action">Walking.</stagedir>
<line>I like the air of it better than my garden at Chelsea. By your patience, good people, that have pressed thus into my bedchamber, if you&#8217;ll not trouble me, I&#8217;ll take a sound sleep here.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SHREWSBURY.</speaker>
<line>My lord, &#8217;twere good you&#8217;ld publish to the world</line>
<line>Your great offense unto his majesty.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>My lord, I&#8217;ll bequeath this legacy to the hangman,</line>
<stagedir type="action">Gives him his gown.</stagedir>
<line>and do it instantly. I confess, his majesty hath been ever good to me; and my offense to his highness makes me of a state pleader a stage player (though I am old, and have a bad voice), to act this last scene of my tragedy. I&#8217;ll send him (for my trespass) a reverend head, somewhat bald; for it is not requisite any head should stand covered to so high majesty. If that content him not, because I think my body will then do me small pleasure, let him but bury it, and take it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SURREY.</speaker>
<line>My lord, my lord, hold conference with your soul;</line>
<line>You see, my lord, the time of life is short.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>I see it, my good lord; I dispatched that business the last night. I come hither only to be let blood; my doctor here tells me it is good for the headache.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HANGMAN.</speaker>
<line>I beseech thee, my lord, forgive me!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Forgive thee, honest fellow! Why?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HANGMAN.</speaker>
<line>For your death, my lord.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>O, my death? I had rather it were in thy power to forgive me, for thou hast the sharpest action against me; the law, my honest friend, lies in thy hands now. Here&#8217;s thy fee;</line>
<stagedir type="action">His purse.</stagedir>
<line>and, my good fellow, let my suit be dispatched presently; for &#8217;tis all one pain, to die a lingering death, and to live in the continual mill of a lawsuit. But I can tell thee, my neck is so short, that, if thou shouldst behead an hundred noblemen like myself, thou wouldst ne&#8217;er get credit by it; therefore (look ye, sir), do it handsomely, or, of my word, thou shalt never deal with me hereafter.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HANGMAN.</speaker>
<line>I&#8217;ll take an order for that, my lord.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>One thing more; take heed thou cutst not off my beard. Oh, I forgot; execution passed upon that last night, and the body of it lies buried in the Tower. Stay; is&#8217;t not possible to make a scape from all this strong guard? It is.</line>
<line>There is a thing within me, that will raise</line>
<line>And elevate my better part bove sight</line>
<line>Of these same weaker eyes; and, Master Sheriffs,</line>
<line>For all this troop of steel that tends my death,</line>
<line>I shall break from you, and fly up to heaven.</line>
<line>Let&#8217;s seek the means for this.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HANGMAN.</speaker>
<line>My lord, I pray ye, put off your doublet.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line>Speak not so coldly to me; I am hoarse already;</line>
<line>I would be loathe, good fellow, to take more.</line>
<line>Point me the block; I ne&#8217;er was here before.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HANGMAN.</speaker>
<line>To the east side, my lord.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MORE.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Then to the east</line>
<line>We go to sigh; that o&#8217;er, to sleep in rest.</line>
<line>Here More forsakes all mirth; good reason why;</line>
<line>The fool of flesh must with her frail life die.</line>
<line>No eye salute my trunk with a sad tear:</line>
<line>Our birth to heaven should be thus, void of fear.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir type="exit">Exit with Hangman, etc.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>SURREY.</speaker>
<line>A very learned worthy gentleman</line>
<line>Seals error with his blood. Come, we&#8217;ll to court.</line>
<line>Let&#8217;s sadly hence to perfect unknown fates,</line>
<line>Whilst he tends prograce to the state of states.</line>
