<line>Hung be the heavens with black, yield day to night!</line>
<line>Comets, importing change of times and states,</line>
<line>Brandish your crystal tresses in the sky,</line>
<line>And with them scourge the bad revolting stars</line>
<line>That have consented unto Henry&#8217;s death:</line>
<line>King Henry the Fifth, too famous to live long!</line>
<line>England ne&#8217;er lost a king of so much worth.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>England ne&#8217;er had a king until his time:</line>
<line>Virtue he had, deserving to command;</line>
<line>His brandish&#8217;d sword did blind men with his beams;</line>
<line>His arms spread wider than a dragon&#8217;s wings;</line>
<line>His sparkling eyes, replete with wrathful fire,</line>
<line>More dazzled and drove back his enemies</line>
<line>Than midday sun fierce bent against their faces.</line>
<line>What should I say? His deeds exceed all speech:</line>
<line>He ne&#8217;er lift up his hand but conquered.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>EXE.</speaker>
<line>We mourn in black, why mourn we not in blood?</line>
<line>Henry is dead, and never shall revive.</line>
<line>Upon a wooden coffin we attend,</line>
<line>And death&#8217;s dishonorable victory</line>
<line>We with our stately presence glorify,</line>
<line>Like captives bound to a triumphant car.</line>
<line>What? Shall we curse the planets of mishap</line>
<line>That plotted thus our glory&#8217;s overthrow?</line>
<line>Or shall we think the subtile-witted French</line>
<line>Conjurers and sorcerers, that, afraid of him,</line>
<line>By magic verses have contriv&#8217;d his end?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WIN.</speaker>
<line>He was a king blest of the King of kings.</line>
<line>Unto the French the dreadful Judgment Day</line>
<line>So dreadful will not be as was his sight.</line>
<line>The battles of the Lord of hosts he fought;</line>
<line>The Church&#8217;s prayers made him so prosperous.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>The Church? Where is it? Had not churchmen pray&#8217;d,</line>

<line>In stead of gold, we&#8217;ll offer up our arms,</line>
<line>Since arms avail not now that Henry&#8217;s dead.</line>
<line>Posterity, await for wretched years,</line>

<line>Henry the Fifth, thy ghost I invocate:</line>

<line>No treachery, but want of men and money.</line>
<line>Amongst the soldiers this is muttered,</line>
<line>That here you maintain several factions;</line>
<line>And whilst a field should be dispatch&#8217;d and fought,</line>
<line>You are disputing of your generals.</line>
<line>One would have ling&#8217;ring wars with little cost;</line>

<speaker>3. MESS.</speaker>
<line>My gracious lords, to add to your laments,</line>
<line>Wherewith you now bedew King Henry&#8217;s hearse,</line>
<line>I must inform you of a dismal fight</line>
<line>Betwixt the stout Lord Talbot and the French.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WIN.</speaker>
<line>What? Wherein Talbot overcame, is&#8217;t so?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>3. MESS.</speaker>
<line>O no; wherein Lord Talbot was o&#8217;er-thrown.</line>
<line>The circumstance I&#8217;ll tell you more at large.</line>
<line>The tenth of August last this dreadful lord,</line>
<line>Retiring from the siege of Orleance,</line>
<line>Having full scarce six thousand in his troop,</line>
<line>By three and twenty thousand of the French</line>
<line>Was round encompassed, and set upon.</line>
<line>No leisure had he to enrank his men;</line>
<line>He wanted pikes to set before his archers;</line>
<line>In stead whereof sharp stakes pluck&#8217;d out of hedges</line>
<line>They pitched in the ground confusedly,</line>
<line>To keep the horsemen off from breaking in.</line>
<line>More than three hours the fight continued,</line>
<line>Where valiant Talbot above human thought</line>
<line>Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:</line>
<line>Hundreds he sent to hell, and none durst stand him;</line>
<line>Here, there, and every where, enrag&#8217;d he slew.</line>
<line>The French exclaim&#8217;d, the devil was in arms;</line>
<line>All the whole army stood agaz&#8217;d on him.</line>
<line>His soldiers, spying his undaunted spirit,</line>
<line>&#8220;A Talbot! A Talbot!&#8221; cried out amain,</line>
<line>And rush&#8217;d into the bowels of the battle.</line>
<line>Here had the conquest fully been seal&#8217;d up,</line>
<line>If Sir John Falstaff had not play&#8217;d the coward.</line>
<line>He, being in the vaward, plac&#8217;d behind</line>
<line>With purpose to relieve and follow them,</line>
<line>Cowardly fled, not having struck one stroke.</line>
<line>Hence grew the general wrack and massacre;</line>
<line>Enclosed were they with their enemies.</line>
<line>A base Wallon, to win the Dauphin&#8217;s grace,</line>
<line>Thrust Talbot with a spear into the back,</line>
<line>Whom all France with their chief assembled strength</line>
<line>Durst not presume to look once in the face.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BED.</speaker>
<line>Is Talbot slain then? I will slay myself</line>
<line>For living idly here in pomp and ease,</line>
<line>Whilst such a worthy leader, wanting aid,</line>
<line>Unto his dastard foemen is betray&#8217;d.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>3. MESS.</speaker>
<line>O no, he lives, but is took prisoner,</line>
<line>And Lord Scales with him, and Lord Hungerford.</line>
<line>Most of the rest slaughter&#8217;d or took likewise.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BED.</speaker>
<line>His ransom there is none but I shall pay:</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll hale the Dauphin headlong from his throne,</line>
<line>His crown shall be the ransom of my friend;</line>
<line>Four of their lords I&#8217;ll change for one of ours.</line>
<line>Farewell, my masters, to my task will I.</line>
<line>Bonfires in France forthwith I am to make,</line>
<line>To keep our great Saint George&#8217;s feast withal.</line>
<line>Ten thousand soldiers with me I will take,</line>
<line>Whose bloody deeds shall make all Europe quake.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>3. MESS.</speaker>
<line>So you had need, for Orleance is besieg&#8217;d;</line>
<line>The English army is grown weak and faint;</line>
<line>The Earl of Salisbury craveth supply,</line>
<line>And hardly keeps his men from mutiny,</line>
<line>Since they, so few, watch such a multitude.</line>

<line>And these grey locks, the pursuivants of death,</line>
<line>Nestor-like aged, in an age of care,</line>
<line>Argue the end of Edmund Mortimer.</line>
<line>These eyes, like lamps whose wasting oil is spent,</line>
<line>Wax dim, as drawing to their exigent;</line>
<line>Weak shoulders, overborne with burdening grief,</line>
<line>And pithless arms, like to a withered vine</line>

<line>Since Henry Monmouth first began to reign,</line>
<line>Before whose glory I was great in arms,</line>

<line>Direct mine arms I may embrace his neck,</line>

<line>Why didst thou say, of late thou wert despis&#8217;d?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PLAN.</speaker>
<line>First, lean thine aged back against mine arm,</line>
<line>And in that ease, I&#8217;ll tell thee my disease.</line>
<line>This day, in argument upon a case,</line>
<line>Some words there grew &#8217;twixt Somerset and me;</line>
<line>Among which terms he us&#8217;d his lavish tongue</line>
<line>And did upbraid me with my father&#8217;s death;</line>
<line>Which obloquy set bars before my tongue,</line>
<line>Else with the like I had requited him.</line>
<line>Therefore, good uncle, for my father&#8217;s sake,</line>
<line>In honor of a true Plantagenet,</line>
<line>And for alliance sake, declare the cause</line>
<line>My father, Earl of Cambridge, lost his head.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MOR.</speaker>
<line>That cause, fair nephew, that imprison&#8217;d me</line>
<line>And hath detain&#8217;d me all my flow&#8217;ring youth</line>
<line>Within a loathsome dungeon, there to pine,</line>
<line>Was cursed instrument of his decease.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PLAN.</speaker>
<line>Discover more at large what cause that was,</line>
<line>For I am ignorant and cannot guess.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MOR.</speaker>
<line>I will, if that my fading breath permit</line>
<line>And death approach not ere my tale be done.</line>
<line>Henry the Fourth, grandfather to this king,</line>
<line>Depos&#8217;d his nephew Richard, Edward&#8217;s son,</line>
<line>The first begotten, and the lawful heir</line>
<line>Of Edward king, the third of that descent;</line>
<line>During whose reign the Percies of the north,</line>
<line>Finding his usurpation most unjust,</line>
<line>Endeavor&#8217;d my advancement to the throne.</line>
<line>The reason mov&#8217;d these warlike lords to this</line>
<line>Was, for that (young Richard thus remov&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Leaving no heir begotten of his body)</line>
<line>I was the next by birth and parentage;</line>
<line>For by my mother I derived am</line>
<line>From Lionel Duke of Clarence, third son</line>
<line>To King Edward the Third; whereas he</line>
<line>From John of Gaunt doth bring his pedigree,</line>
<line>Being but fourth of that heroic line.</line>
<line>But mark: as in this haughty great attempt</line>
<line>They labored to plant the rightful heir,</line>
<line>I lost my liberty, and they their lives.</line>
<line>Long after this, when Henry the Fifth</line>
<line>(Succeeding his father Bullingbrook) did reign,</line>
<line>Thy father, Earl of Cambridge then, deriv&#8217;d</line>
<line>From famous Edmund Langley, Duke of York,</line>
<line>Marrying my sister that thy mother was,</line>
<line>Again, in pity of my hard distress,</line>
<line>Levied an army, weening to redeem</line>
<line>And have install&#8217;d me in the diadem.</line>
<line>But as the rest, so fell that noble earl,</line>
<line>And was beheaded. Thus the Mortimers,</line>
<line>In whom the title rested, were suppress&#8217;d.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PLAN.</speaker>
<line>Of which, my lord, your honor is the last.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MOR.</speaker>
<line>True; and thou seest that I no issue have,</line>
<line>And that my fainting words do warrant death.</line>
<line>Thou art my heir; the rest I wish thee gather;</line>
<line>But yet be wary in thy studious care.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PLAN.</speaker>
<line>Thy grave admonishments prevail with me.</line>
<line>But yet methinks, my father&#8217;s execution</line>
<line>Was nothing less than bloody tyranny.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MOR.</speaker>
<line>With silence, nephew, be thou politic.</line>
<line>Strong fixed is the house of Lancaster,</line>
<line>And like a mountain, not to be remov&#8217;d.</line>
<line>But now thy uncle is removing hence,</line>
<line>As princes do their courts, when they are cloy&#8217;d</line>
<line>With long continuance in a settled place.</line>

<line>O uncle, would some part of my young years</line>
<line>Might but redeem the passage of your age!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MOR.</speaker>
<line>Thou dost then wrong me, as that slaughterer doth</line>
<line>Which giveth many wounds when one will kill.</line>
<line>Mourn not, except thou sorrow for my good,</line>
<line>Only give order for my funeral.</line>
<line>And so farewell, and fair be all thy hopes,</line>
<line>And prosperous be thy life in peace and war!</line>

<line>Well, I will lock his counsel in my breast,</line>

<line>You have great reason to do Richard right,</line>
<line>Especially for those occasions</line>
<line>At Eltam Place I told your Majesty.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<line>And those occasions, uncle, were of force:</line>

<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>Now will it best avail your Majesty</line>
<line>To cross the seas and to be crown&#8217;d in France.</line>
<line>The presence of a king engenders love</line>

<line>This late dissension grown betwixt the peers</line>

<line>As fest&#8217;red members rot but by degree,</line>
<line>Till bones and flesh and sinews fall away,</line>
<line>So will this base and envious discord breed.</line>
<line>And now I fear that fatal prophecy</line>
<line>Which in the time of Henry nam&#8217;d the Fifth</line>
<line>Was in the mouth of every sucking babe,</line>
<line>That Henry born at Monmouth should win all,</line>

<line>My gracious sovereign, as I rode from Callice,</line>

<line>A letter was deliver&#8217;d to my hands,</line>
<line>Writ to your Grace from th&#8217; Duke of Burgundy.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Presents it.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>TAL.</speaker>
<line>Shame to the Duke of Burgundy and thee!</line>
<line>I vow&#8217;d, base knight, when I did meet thee next,</line>
<line>To tear the Garter from thy craven&#8217;s leg,</line>

<stagedir>Plucking it off.</stagedir>
<line>Which I have done, because (unworthily)</line>
<line>Thou wast installed in that high degree.</line>
<line>Pardon me, princely Henry, and the rest.</line>
<line>This dastard, at the battle of Poictiers,</line>
<line>When (but in all) I was six thousand strong</line>
<line>And that the French were almost ten to one,</line>
<line>Before we met, or that a stroke was given,</line>
<line>Like to a trusty squire did run away;</line>
<line>In which assault we lost twelve hundred men;</line>
<line>Myself and divers gentlemen beside</line>
<line>Were there surpris&#8217;d and taken prisoners.</line>
<line>Then judge, great lords, if I have done amiss;</line>
<line>Or whether that such cowards ought to wear</line>
<line>This ornament of knighthood, yea or no?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>To say the truth, this fact was infamous</line>
<line>And ill beseeming any common man,</line>
<line>Much more a knight, a captain, and a leader.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TAL.</speaker>
<line>When first this order was ordain&#8217;d, my lords,</line>
<line>Knights of the Garter were of noble birth,</line>
<line>Valiant and virtuous, full of haughty courage,</line>
<line>Such as were grown to credit by the wars;</line>
<line>Not fearing death, nor shrinking for distress,</line>
<line>But always resolute in most extremes.</line>
<line>He then, that is not furnish&#8217;d in this sort,</line>
<line>Doth but usurp the sacred name of knight,</line>
<line>Profaning this most honorable order,</line>
<line>And should (if I were worthy to be judge)</line>
<line>Be quite degraded, like a hedge-born swain</line>
<line>That doth presume to boast of gentle blood.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>

<line>No more but plain and bluntly &#8220;To the King&#8221;?</line>

<speech>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<line>What is that wrong whereof you both complain?</line>
<line>First let me know, and then I&#8217;ll answer you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BAS.</speaker>
<line>Crossing the sea from England into France,</line>
<line>This fellow here, with envious carping tongue,</line>
<line>Upbraided me about the rose I wear,</line>
<line>Saying the sanguine color of the leaves</line>
<line>Did represent my master&#8217;s blushing cheeks,</line>
<line>When stubbornly he did repugn the truth</line>
<line>About a certain question in the law</line>
<line>Argu&#8217;d betwixt the Duke of York and him;</line>
<line>With other vile and ignominious terms:</line>
<line>In confutation of which rude reproach,</line>
<line>And in defense of my lord&#8217;s worthiness,</line>
<line>I crave the benefit of law of arms.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VER.</speaker>
<line>And that is my petition, noble lord.</line>
<line>For though he seem with forged quaint conceit</line>
<line>To set a gloss upon his bold intent,</line>
<line>Yet know, my lord, I was provok&#8217;d by him,</line>
<line>And he first took exceptions at this badge,</line>
<line>Pronouncing that the paleness of this flower</line>
<line>Bewray&#8217;d the faintness of my master&#8217;s heart.</line>
</speech>

<line>Your private grudge, my Lord of York, will out,</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<line>Good Lord, what madness rules in brain-sick men,</line>
<line>When for so slight and frivolous a cause</line>
<line>Such factious emulations shall arise!</line>
<line>Good cousins both, of York and Somerset,</line>
<line>Quiet yourselves, I pray, and be at peace.</line>
</speech>

<speech>

<line>Let this dissension first be tried by fight,</line>
<line>And then your Highness shall command a peace.</line>

<line>The quarrel toucheth none but us alone,</line>
<line>Betwixt ourselves let us decide it then.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>YORK.</speaker>
<line>There is my pledge, accept it, Somerset.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VER.</speaker>
<line>Nay, let it rest where it began at first.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BAS.</speaker>
<line>Confirm it so, mine honorable lord.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>Confirm it so? Confounded be your strife,</line>
<line>And perish ye, with your audacious prate!</line>
<line>Presumptuous vassals, are you not asham&#8217;d</line>
<line>With this immodest clamorous outrage</line>
<line>To trouble and disturb the King and us?</line>
<line>And you, my lords, methinks you do not well</line>
<line>To bear with their perverse objections;</line>
<line>Much less to take occasion from their mouths</line>
<line>To raise a mutiny betwixt yourselves.</line>
<line>Let me persuade you take a better course.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>EXE.</speaker>
<line>It grieves his Highness. Good my lords, be friends.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<line>Come hither, you that would be combatants:</line>
<line>Henceforth I charge you, as you love our favor,</line>
<line>Quite to forget this quarrel, and the cause.</line>
<line>And you, my lords: remember where we are&#8212;</line>
<line>In France, amongst a fickle, wavering nation.</line>
<line>If they perceive dissension in our looks,</line>
<line>And that within ourselves we disagree,</line>
<line>How will their grudging stomachs be provok&#8217;d</line>
<line>To willful disobedience, and rebel!</line>
<line>Beside, what infamy will there arise,</line>
<line>When foreign princes shall be certified</line>
<line>That for a toy, a thing of no regard,</line>
<line>King Henry&#8217;s peers and chief nobility</line>
<line>Destroy&#8217;d themselves, and lost the realm of France!</line>
<line>O, think upon the conquest of my father,</line>
<line>My tender years, and let us not forgo</line>
<line>That for a trifle that was bought with blood!</line>
<line>Let me be umpeer in this doubtful strife.</line>
<line>I see no reason, if I wear this rose,</line>

<stagedir>Putting on a red rose.</stagedir>
<line>That any one should therefore be suspicious</line>
<line>I more incline to Somerset than York:</line>
<line>Both are my kinsmen, and I love them both.</line>
<line>As well they may upbraid me with my crown,</line>
<line>Because, forsooth, the King of Scots is crown&#8217;d.</line>
<line>But your discretions better can persuade</line>
<line>Than I am able to instruct or teach;</line>
<line>And therefore, as we hither came in peace,</line>
<line>So let us still continue peace, and love.</line>
<line>Cousin of York, we institute your Grace</line>
<line>To be our regent in these parts of France;</line>
<line>And, good my Lord of Somerset, unite</line>
<line>Your troops of horsemen with his bands of foot,</line>
<line>And like true subjects, sons of your progenitors,</line>
<line>Go cheerfully together and digest</line>
<line>Your angry choler on your enemies.</line>
<line>Ourself, my Lord Protector, and the rest,</line>
<line>After some respite, will return to Callice;</line>
<line>From thence to England, where I hope ere long</line>
<line>To be presented, by your victories,</line>

<line>Whither, my lord? From bought and sold Lord Talbot,</line>
<line>Who, ring&#8217;d about with bold adversity,</line>
<line>Cries out for noble York and Somerset</line>
<line>To beat assailing death from his weak legions;</line>
<line>And whiles the honorable captain there</line>

<line>And, in advantage ling&#8217;ring, looks for rescue,</line>
<line>You, his false hopes, the trust of England&#8217;s honor,</line>
<line>Keep off aloof with worthless emulation.</line>
<line>Let not your private discord keep away</line>
<line>The levied succors that should lend him aid,</line>
<line>While he, renowned noble gentleman,</line>
<line>Yield up his life unto a world of odds.</line>
<line>Orleance the Bastard, Charles, Burgundy,</line>

<line>O young John Talbot, I did send for thee</line>
<line>To tutor thee in stratagems of war,</line>
<line>That Talbot&#8217;s name might be in thee reviv&#8217;d,</line>
<line>When sapless age and weak unable limbs</line>
<line>Should bring thy father to his drooping chair.</line>
<line>But O malignant and ill-boding stars!</line>
<line>Now thou art come unto a feast of death,</line>
<line>A terrible and unavoided danger;</line>
<line>Therefore, dear boy, mount on my swiftest horse,</line>
<line>And I&#8217;ll direct thee how thou shalt escape</line>
<line>By sudden flight. Come, dally not, be gone.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JOHN.</speaker>
<line>Is my name Talbot? And am I your son?</line>
<line>And shall I fly? O, if you love my mother,</line>
<line>Dishonor not her honorable name</line>
<line>To make a bastard and a slave of me!</line>
<line>The world will say, he is not Talbot&#8217;s blood,</line>
<line>That basely fled when noble Talbot stood.</line>
</speech>

<line>Fly, to revenge my death, if I be slain.</line>

<line>If we both stay, we both are sure to die.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>JOHN.</speaker>
<line>Then let me stay, and, father, do you fly.</line>
<line>Your loss is great, so your regard should be;</line>
<line>My worth unknown, no loss is known in me.</line>
<line>Upon my death the French can little boast;</line>
<line>In yours they will, in you all hopes are lost.</line>
<line>Flight cannot stain the honor you have won,</line>
<line>But mine it will, that no exploit have done.</line>
<line>You fled for vantage, every one will swear;</line>
<line>But if I bow, they&#8217;ll say it was for fear.</line>
<line>There is no hope that ever I will stay,</line>
<line>If the first hour I shrink and run away.</line>
<line>Here on my knee I beg mortality,</line>
<line>Rather than life preserv&#8217;d with infamy.</line>

<line>You cannot witness for me, being slain.</line>
<line>If death be so apparent, then both fly.</line>

<line>And leave my followers here to fight and die?</line>
<line>My age was never tainted with such shame.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>JOHN.</speaker>
<line>And shall my youth be guilty of such blame?</line>
<line>No more can I be severed from your side</line>

<line>Stay, go, do what you will, the like do I;</line>
<line>For live I will not if my father die.</line>

<line>Of thy first fight, I soon encountered,</line>

<stagedir>They shake their heads.</stagedir>

<line>Thou art allotted to be ta&#8217;en by me;</line>
<line>So doth the swan her downy cygnets save,</line>
<line>Keeping them prisoner underneath her wings.</line>
<line>Yet, if this servile usage once offend,</line>
<line>Go, and be free again, as Suffolk&#8217;s friend.</line>

<stagedir>She is going.</stagedir>
<line>O, stay!</line>

<stagedir>Aside.</stagedir>
<line offset="2">I have no power to let her pass,</line>
<line>My hand would free her, but my heart says no.</line>
<line>As plays the sun upon the glassy streams,</line>
<line>Twinkling another counterfeited beam,</line>
<line>So seems this gorgeous beauty to mine eyes.</line>
<line>Fain would I woo her, yet I dare not speak:</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll call for pen and ink, and write my mind.</line>
<line>Fie, De la Pole, disable not thyself.</line>
<line>Hast not a tongue? Is she not here?</line>
<line>Wilt thou be daunted at a woman&#8217;s sight?</line>

<line>Say, Earl of Suffolk&#8212;if thy name be so&#8212;</line>
<line>What ransom must I pay before I pass?</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SUF.</speaker>

<line>Why speak&#8217;st thou not? What ransom must I pay?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SUF.</speaker>

<line>She&#8217;s beautiful; and therefore to be wooed:</line>
<line>She is a woman; therefore to be won.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MAR.</speaker>
<line>Wilt thou accept of ransom, yea or no?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SUF.</speaker>

<line>Fond man, remember that thou hast a wife,</line>

<speech>
<speaker>MAR.</speaker>
<line>I were best to leave him, for he will not hear.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SUF.</speaker>
<stagedir>Aside.</stagedir>
<line>There all is marr&#8217;d; there lies a cooling card.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MAR.</speaker>
<line>He talks at randon; sure the man is mad.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SUF.</speaker>
<stagedir>Aside.</stagedir>
<line>And yet a dispensation may be had.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MAR.</speaker>
<line>And yet I would that you would answer me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SUF.</speaker>
<stagedir>Aside.</stagedir>
<line>I&#8217;ll win this Lady Margaret. For whom?</line>
<line>Why, for my king. Tush, that&#8217;s a wooden thing!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MAR.</speaker>
<line>He talks of wood; it is some carpenter.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SUF.</speaker>
<stagedir>Aside.</stagedir>
<line>Yet so my fancy may be satisfied,</line>
<line>And peace established between these realms.</line>
<line>But there remains a scruple in that too;</line>
<line>For though her father be the King of Naples,</line>
<line>Duke of Anjou and Maine, yet is he poor,</line>
<line>And our nobility will scorn the match.</line>
</speech>

<speech>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SUF.</speaker>
<line>Lady, vouchsafe to listen what I say.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MAR.</speaker>
<stagedir>Aside.</stagedir>
<line>Perhaps I shall be rescu&#8217;d by the French,</line>
<line>And then I need not crave his courtesy.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SUF.</speaker>
<line>Sweet madam, give me hearing in a cause.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MAR.</speaker>
<stagedir>Aside.</stagedir>
<line>Tush, women have been captivate ere now.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SUF.</speaker>
<line>Lady, wherefore talk you so?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MAR.</speaker>
<line>I cry you mercy, &#8217;tis but quid for quo.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SUF.</speaker>
<line>Say, gentle Princess, would you not suppose</line>
<line>Your bondage happy, to be made a queen?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MAR.</speaker>
<line>To be a queen in bondage is more vile</line>
<line>Than is a slave in base servility;</line>
<line>For princes should be free.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SUF.</speaker>
<line offset="5">And so shall you,</line>
<line>If happy England&#8217;s royal king be free.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MAR.</speaker>
<line>Why, what concerns his freedom unto me?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SUF.</speaker>
<line>I&#8217;ll undertake to make thee Henry&#8217;s queen,</line>
<line>To put a golden sceptre in thy hand,</line>
<line>And set a precious crown upon thy head,</line>
<line>If thou wilt condescend to be my&#8212;</line>

</speech>

<speech>

<line>His love.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MAR.</speaker>
<line>I am unworthy to be Henry&#8217;s wife.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SUF.</speaker>
<line>No, gentle madam, I unworthy am</line>
<line>To woo so fair a dame to be his wife</line>
<line>And have no portion in the choice myself.</line>
<line>How say you, madam, are ye so content?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MAR.</speaker>
<line>And if my father please, I am content.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SUF.</speaker>
<line>Then call our captains and our colors forth,</line>
<line>And, madam, at your father&#8217;s castle walls</line>
<line>We&#8217;ll crave a parley, to confer with him.</line>

<stagedir>Sound a parley. Enter Reignier on the walls.</stagedir>
<line>See, Reignier, see, thy daughter prisoner!</line>

<speech>
<speaker>REIG.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Suffolk, what remedy?</line>
<line>I am a soldier, and unapt to weep,</line>
<line>Or to exclaim on fortune&#8217;s fickleness.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SUF.</speaker>
<line>Yes, there is remedy enough, my lord.</line>
<line>Consent, and for thy honor give consent,</line>
<line>Thy daughter shall be wedded to my king,</line>
<line>Whom I with pain have wooed and won thereto;</line>
<line>And this her easy-held imprisonment</line>
<line>Hath gain&#8217;d thy daughter princely liberty.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>REIG.</speaker>
<line>Speaks Suffolk as he thinks?</line>

<line offset="6">Fair Margaret knows</line>

<speech>
<speaker>REIG.</speaker>
<line>Upon thy princely warrant, I descend</line>
<line>To give thee answer of thy just demand.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit from the walls.</stagedir>

<speaker>SUF.</speaker>
<line>And here I will expect thy coming.</line>

<line>Welcome, brave Earl, into our territories!</line>
<line>Command in Anjou what your honor pleases.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SUF.</speaker>
<line>Thanks, Reignier, happy for so sweet a child,</line>
<line>Fit to be made companion with a king.</line>
<line>What answer makes your Grace unto my suit?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>REIG.</speaker>
<line>Since thou dost deign to woo her little worth</line>
<line>To be the princely bride of such a lord,</line>
<line>Upon condition I may quietly</line>
<line>Enjoy mine own, the country Maine and Anjou,</line>
<line>Free from oppression or the stroke of war,</line>
<line>My daughter shall be Henry&#8217;s, if he please.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SUF.</speaker>
<line>That is her ransom; I deliver her,</line>
<line>And those two counties I will undertake</line>
<line>Your Grace shall well and quietly enjoy.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>REIG.</speaker>
<line>And I again, in Henry&#8217;s royal name,</line>
<line>As deputy unto that gracious king,</line>
<line>Give thee her hand, for sign of plighted faith.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SUF.</speaker>
<line>Reignier of France, I give thee kingly thanks,</line>
<line>Because this is in traffic of a king.</line>

<stagedir>Aside.</stagedir>
<line>And yet methinks I could be well content</line>
<line>To be mine own attorney in this case.&#8212;</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll over then to England with this news,</line>
<line>And make this marriage to be solemniz&#8217;d.</line>
<line>So farewell, Reignier! Set this diamond safe</line>
<line>In golden palaces, as it becomes.</line>

<line>The Christian prince, King Henry, were he here.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>SUF.</speaker>
<line>Farewell, sweet madam! But hark you, Margaret,</line>
<line>No princely commendations to my king?</line>

<line>Such commendations as becomes a maid,</line>

<line>Yes, my good lord, a pure unspotted heart,</line>

<line>Bethink thee on her virtues that surmount,</line>

<line>Why, here&#8217;s a girl! I think she knows not well</line>
<line>(There were so many) whom she may accuse.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WAR.</speaker>
<line>It&#8217;s sign she hath been liberal and free.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>YORK.</speaker>
<line>And yet forsooth she is a virgin pure.</line>
<line>Strumpet, thy words condemn thy brat and thee.</line>
<line>Use no entreaty, for it is in vain.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PUC.</speaker>
<line>Then lead me hence; with whom I leave my curse:</line>
<line>May never glorious sun reflex his beams</line>
<line>Upon the country where you make abode;</line>
<line>But darkness and the gloomy shade of death</line>
<line>Environ you, till mischief and despair</line>
<line>Drive you to break your necks or hang yourselves!</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit guarded.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>YORK.</speaker>
<line>Break thou in pieces and consume to ashes,</line>
<line>Thou foul accursed minister of hell!</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Winchester, now Cardinal Beauford, attended.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker alias="WIN.">CAR.</speaker>
<line>Lord Regent, I do greet your Excellence</line>
<line>With letters of commission from the King.</line>
<line>For know, my lords, the states of Christendom,</line>
<line>Mov&#8217;d with remorse of these outrageous broils,</line>
<line>Have earnestly implor&#8217;d a general peace</line>
<line>Betwixt our nation and the aspiring French;</line>
<line>And here at hand the Dauphin and his train</line>
<line>Approacheth, to confer about some matter.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>YORK.</speaker>
<line>Is all our travail turn&#8217;d to this effect?</line>
<line>After the slaughter of so many peers,</line>
<line>So many captains, gentlemen, and soldiers,</line>
<line>That in this quarrel have been overthrown</line>
<line>And sold their bodies for their country&#8217;s benefit,</line>
<line>Shall we at last conclude effeminate peace?</line>
<line>Have we not lost most part of all the towns,</line>
<line>By treason, falsehood, and by treachery,</line>
<line>Our great progenitors had conquered?</line>
<line>O Warwick, Warwick, I foresee with grief</line>
<line>The utter loss of all the realm of France.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WAR.</speaker>
<line>Be patient, York. If we conclude a peace,</line>
<line>It shall be with such strict and severe covenants,</line>
<line>As little shall the Frenchmen gain thereby.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Charles, Alanson, Bastard, Reignier, and others.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>CHAR.</speaker>
<line>Since, lords of England, it is thus agreed</line>
<line>That peaceful truce shall be proclaim&#8217;d in France,</line>
<line>We come to be informed by yourselves</line>
<line>What the conditions of that league must be.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>YORK.</speaker>
<line>Speak, Winchester, for boiling choler chokes</line>
<line>The hollow passage of my poison&#8217;d voice,</line>
<line>By sight of these our baleful enemies.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker alias="WIN.">CAR.</speaker>
<line>Charles, and the rest, it is enacted thus:</line>
<line>That, in regard King Henry gives consent,</line>
<line>Of mere compassion and of lenity,</line>
<line>To ease your country of distressful war</line>
<line>And suffer you to breathe in fruitful peace,</line>
<line>You shall become true liegemen to his crown.</line>
<line>And, Charles, upon condition thou wilt swear</line>
<line>To pay him tribute and submit thyself,</line>
<line>Thou shalt be plac&#8217;d as viceroy under him,</line>
<line>And still enjoy thy regal dignity.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ALAN.</speaker>
<line>Must he be then as shadow of himself?</line>
<line>Adorn his temples with a coronet,</line>
<line>And yet, in substance and authority,</line>
<line>Retain but privilege of a private man?</line>
<line>This proffer is absurd and reasonless.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CHAR.</speaker>
<line>&#8217;Tis known already that I am possess&#8217;d</line>
<line>With more than half the Gallian territories,</line>
<line>And therein reverenc&#8217;d for their lawful king.</line>
<line>Shall I, for lucre of the rest unvanquish&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Detract so much from that prerogative</line>
<line>As to be call&#8217;d but viceroy of the whole?</line>
<line>No, lord ambassador, I&#8217;ll rather keep</line>
<line>That which I have than, coveting for more,</line>
<line>Be cast from possibility of all.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>YORK.</speaker>
<line>Insulting Charles, hast thou by secret means</line>
<line>Us&#8217;d intercession to obtain a league,</line>
<line>And, now the matter grows to compromise,</line>
<line>Stand&#8217;st thou aloof upon comparison?</line>
<line>Either accept the title thou usurp&#8217;st,</line>
<line>Of benefit proceeding from our king,</line>
<line>And not of any challenge of desert,</line>
<line>Or we will plague thee with incessant wars.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>REIG.</speaker>
<stagedir>Aside to Charles.</stagedir>
<line>My lord, you do not well in obstinacy</line>
<line>To cavil in the course of this contract.</line>
<line>If once it be neglected, ten to one</line>
<line>We shall not find like opportunity.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ALAN.</speaker>
<stagedir>Aside to Charles.</stagedir>
<line>To say the truth, it is your policy</line>
<line>To save your subjects from such massacre</line>
<line>And ruthless slaughters as are daily seen</line>
<line>By our proceeding in hostility,</line>
<line>And therefore take this compact of a truce,</line>
<line>Although you break it when your pleasure serves.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WAR.</speaker>
<line>How say&#8217;st thou, Charles? Shall our condition stand?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CHAR.</speaker>
<line>It shall;</line>
<line>Only reserv&#8217;d, you claim no interest</line>
<line>In any of our towns of garrison.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>YORK.</speaker>
<line>Then swear allegiance to his Majesty,</line>
<line>As thou art knight, never to disobey</line>
<line>Nor be rebellious to the crown of England.</line>
<line>Thou, nor thy nobles, to the crown of England.</line>

<stagedir>Charles and his party give tokens of fealty.</stagedir>
<line>So, now dismiss your army when ye please;</line>
<line>Hang up your ensigns, let your drums be still,</line>
<line>For here we entertain a solemn peace.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exeunt.</stagedir>

<scenelocation>London. The palace.</scenelocation>
<scenepersonae>(Suffolk, King, Gloucester, Exeter)</scenepersonae>

<stagedir>Enter Suffolk in conference with the King, Gloucester, and Exeter.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<line>Your wondrous rare description, noble Earl,</line>
<line>Of beauteous Margaret hath astonish&#8217;d me.</line>
<line>Her virtues, graced with external gifts,</line>
<line>Do breed love&#8217;s settled passions in my heart,</line>
<line>And like as rigor of tempestuous gusts</line>
<line>Provokes the mightiest hulk against the tide,</line>
<line>So am I driven by breath of her renown,</line>
<line>Either to suffer shipwrack, or arrive</line>
<line>Where I may have fruition of her love.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SUF.</speaker>
<line>Tush, my good lord, this superficial tale</line>
<line>Is but a preface of her worthy praise.</line>
<line>The chief perfections of that lovely dame</line>
<line>(Had I sufficient skill to utter them)</line>
<line>Would make a volume of enticing lines,</line>
<line>Able to ravish any dull conceit;</line>
<line>And, which is more, she is not so divine,</line>
<line>So full replete with choice of all delights,</line>
<line>But with as humble lowliness of mind</line>
<line>She is content to be at your command&#8212;</line>
<line>Command, I mean, of virtuous chaste intents,</line>
<line>To love and honor Henry as her lord.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<line>And otherwise will Henry ne&#8217;er presume.</line>
<line>Therefore, my Lord Protector, give consent</line>
<line>That Marg&#8217;ret may be England&#8217;s royal queen.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>So should I give consent to flatter sin.</line>
<line>You know, my lord, your Highness is betroth&#8217;d</line>
<line>Unto another lady of esteem.</line>
<line>How shall we then dispense with that contract,</line>
<line>And not deface your honor with reproach?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SUF.</speaker>
<line>As doth a ruler with unlawful oaths,</line>
<line>Or one that at a triumph, having vow&#8217;d</line>
<line>To try his strength, forsaketh yet the lists</line>
<line>By reason of his adversary&#8217;s odds.</line>
<line>A poor earl&#8217;s daughter is unequal odds,</line>
<line>And therefore may be broke without offense.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>Why, what, I pray, is Margaret more than that?</line>
<line>Her father is no better than an earl,</line>
<line>Although in glorious titles he excel.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SUF.</speaker>
<line>Yes, my lord, her father is a king,</line>
<line>The King of Naples and Jerusalem,</line>
<line>And of such great authority in France</line>
<line>As his alliance will confirm our peace,</line>
<line>And keep the Frenchmen in allegiance.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>And so the Earl of Armagnac may do,</line>
<line>Because he is near kinsman unto Charles.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>EXE.</speaker>
<line>Beside, his wealth doth warrant a liberal dower,</line>
<line>Where Reignier sooner will receive than give.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SUF.</speaker>
<line>A dow&#8217;r, my lords? Disgrace not so your king,</line>
<line>That he should be so abject, base, and poor,</line>
<line>To choose for wealth and not for perfect love.</line>
<line>Henry is able to enrich his queen,</line>
<line>And not to seek a queen to make him rich:</line>
<line>So worthless peasants bargain for their wives,</line>
<line>As market men for oxen, sheep, or horse.</line>
<line>Marriage is a matter of more worth</line>
<line>Than to be dealt in by attorneyship.</line>
<line>Not whom we will, but whom his Grace affects,</line>
<line>Must be companion of his nuptial bed.</line>
<line>And therefore, lords, since he affects her most,</line>
<line>Most of all these reasons bindeth us</line>
<line>In our opinions she should be preferr&#8217;d.</line>
<line>For what is wedlock forced, but a hell,</line>
<line>An age of discord and continual strife?</line>
<line>Whereas the contrary bringeth bliss,</line>
<line>And is a pattern of celestial peace.</line>
<line>Whom should we match with Henry, being a king,</line>
<line>But Margaret, that is daughter to a king?</line>
<line>Her peerless feature, joined with her birth,</line>
<line>Approves her fit for none but for a king.</line>
<line>Her valiant courage and undaunted spirit</line>
<line>(More than in women commonly is seen)</line>
<line>Will answer our hope in issue of a king;</line>
<line>For Henry, son unto a conqueror,</line>
<line>Is likely to beget more conquerors,</line>
<line>If with a lady of so high resolve</line>
<line>(As is fair Margaret) he be link&#8217;d in love.</line>
<line>Then yield, my lords, and here conclude with me</line>
<line>That Margaret shall be Queen, and none but she.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<line>Whether it be through force of your report,</line>
<line>My noble Lord of Suffolk, or for that</line>
<line>My tender youth was never yet attaint</line>
<line>With any passion of inflaming love,</line>
<line>I cannot tell; but this I am assur&#8217;d,</line>
<line>I feel such sharp dissension in my breast,</line>
<line>Such fierce alarums both of hope and fear,</line>
<line>As I am sick with working of my thoughts.</line>
<line>Take therefore shipping, post, my lord, to France,</line>
<line>Agree to any covenants, and procure</line>
<line>That Lady Margaret do vouchsafe to come</line>
<line>To cross the seas to England and be crown&#8217;d</line>
<line>King Henry&#8217;s faithful and anointed queen.</line>
<line>For your expenses and sufficient charge,</line>
<line>Among the people gather up a tenth.</line>
<line>Be gone, I say, for till you do return,</line>
<line>I rest perplexed with a thousand cares.</line>
<line>And you, good uncle, banish all offense.</line>
<line>If you do censure me by what you were,</line>
<line>Not what you are, I know it will excuse</line>
<line>This sudden execution of my will.</line>
<line>And so conduct me where, from company,</line>
<line>I may revolve and ruminate my grief.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>GLOU.</speaker>
<line>Ay, grief, I fear me, both at first and last.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit Gloucester with Exeter.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>SUF.</speaker>
<line>Thus Suffolk hath prevail&#8217;d, and thus he goes,</line>
<line>As did the youthful Paris once to Greece,</line>
<line>With hope to find the like event in love,</line>
<line>But prosper better than the Troyan did.</line>
<line>Margaret shall now be Queen, and rule the King;</line>
<line>But I will rule both her, the King, and realm.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit.</stagedir>
