<SPEAKER>BED.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hung be the heavens with black, yield day to night!</LINE>
<LINE>Comets, importing change of times and states,</LINE>
<LINE>Brandish your crystal tresses in the sky,</LINE>
<LINE>And with them scourge the bad revolting stars</LINE>
<LINE>That have consented unto Henry&#8217;s death:</LINE>
<LINE>King Henry the Fifth, too famous to live long!</LINE>
<LINE>England ne&#8217;er lost a king of so much worth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>England ne&#8217;er had a king until his time:</LINE>
<LINE>Virtue he had, deserving to command;</LINE>
<LINE>His brandish&#8217;d sword did blind men with his beams;</LINE>
<LINE>His arms spread wider than a dragon&#8217;s wings;</LINE>
<LINE>His sparkling eyes, replete with wrathful fire,</LINE>
<LINE>More dazzled and drove back his enemies</LINE>
<LINE>Than midday sun fierce bent against their faces.</LINE>
<LINE>What should I say? His deeds exceed all speech:</LINE>
<LINE>He ne&#8217;er lift up his hand but conquered.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EXE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We mourn in black, why mourn we not in blood?</LINE>
<LINE>Henry is dead, and never shall revive.</LINE>
<LINE>Upon a wooden coffin we attend,</LINE>
<LINE>And death&#8217;s dishonorable victory</LINE>
<LINE>We with our stately presence glorify,</LINE>
<LINE>Like captives bound to a triumphant car.</LINE>
<LINE>What? Shall we curse the planets of mishap</LINE>
<LINE>That plotted thus our glory&#8217;s overthrow?</LINE>
<LINE>Or shall we think the subtile-witted French</LINE>
<LINE>Conjurers and sorcerers, that, afraid of him,</LINE>
<LINE>By magic verses have contriv&#8217;d his end?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WIN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He was a king blest of the King of kings.</LINE>
<LINE>Unto the French the dreadful Judgment Day</LINE>
<LINE>So dreadful will not be as was his sight.</LINE>
<LINE>The battles of the Lord of hosts he fought;</LINE>
<LINE>The Church&#8217;s prayers made him so prosperous.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The Church? Where is it? Had not churchmen pray&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>His thread of life had not so soon decay&#8217;d.</LINE>
<LINE>None do you like but an effeminate prince,</LINE>
<LINE>Whom like a schoolboy you may overawe.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WIN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Gloucester, what e&#8217;er we like, thou art Protector,</LINE>
<LINE>And lookest to command the Prince and realm.</LINE>
<LINE>Thy wife is proud, she holdeth thee in awe,</LINE>
<LINE>More than God or religious churchmen may.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Name not religion, for thou lov&#8217;st the flesh,</LINE>
<LINE>And ne&#8217;er throughout the year to church thou go&#8217;st</LINE>
<LINE>Except it be to pray against thy foes.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>BED.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Cease, cease these jars and rest your minds in peace.</LINE>
<LINE>Let&#8217;s to the altar. Heralds, wait on us.</LINE>
<LINE>In stead of gold, we&#8217;ll offer up our arms,</LINE>
<LINE>Since arms avail not now that Henry&#8217;s dead.</LINE>
<LINE>Posterity, await for wretched years,</LINE>
<LINE>When at their mothers&#8217; moist&#8217;ned eyes babes shall suck,</LINE>
<LINE>Our isle be made a nourish of salt tears,</LINE>
<LINE>And none but women left to wail the dead.</LINE>
<LINE>Henry the Fifth, thy ghost I invocate:</LINE>
<LINE>Prosper this realm, keep it from civil broils,</LINE>
<LINE>Combat with adverse planets in the heavens!</LINE>
<LINE>A far more glorious star thy soul will make</LINE>
<LINE>Than Julius Caesar or bright&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter a Messenger.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. MESS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My honorable lords, health to you all!</LINE>
<LINE>Sad tidings bring I to you out of France,</LINE>
<LINE>Of loss, of slaughter, and discomfiture:</LINE>
<LINE>Guienne, Champaigne, Rheims, Orleance,</LINE>
<LINE>Paris, Guysors, Poictiers, are all quite lost.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BED.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What say&#8217;st thou, man, before dead Henry&#8217;s corse?</LINE>
<LINE>Speak softly, or the loss of those great towns</LINE>
<LINE>Will make him burst his lead and rise from death.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is Paris lost? Is Roan yielded up?</LINE>
<LINE>If Henry were recall&#8217;d to life again,</LINE>
<LINE>These news would cause him once more yield the ghost.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EXE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How were they lost? What treachery was us&#8217;d?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. MESS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No treachery, but want of men and money.</LINE>
<LINE>Amongst the soldiers this is muttered,</LINE>
<LINE>That here you maintain several factions;</LINE>
<LINE>And whilst a field should be dispatch&#8217;d and fought,</LINE>
<LINE>You are disputing of your generals.</LINE>
<LINE>One would have ling&#8217;ring wars with little cost;</LINE>
<LINE>Another would fly swift, but wanteth wings;</LINE>
<LINE>A third thinks, without expense at all,</LINE>
<LINE>By guileful fair words peace may be obtain&#8217;d.</LINE>
<LINE>Awake, awake, English nobility!</LINE>
<LINE>Let not sloth dim your honors new begot.</LINE>
<LINE>Cropp&#8217;d are the flower-de-luces in your arms,</LINE>
<LINE>Of England&#8217;s coat one half is cut away.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EXE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Were our tears wanting to this funeral,</LINE>
<LINE>These tidings would call forth her flowing tides.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BED.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Me they concern, Regent I am of France.</LINE>
<LINE>Give me my steeled coat, I&#8217;ll fight for France.</LINE>
<LINE>Away with these disgraceful wailing robes!</LINE>
<LINE>Wounds will I lend the French in stead of eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>To weep their intermissive miseries.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter to them another Messenger.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. MESS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Lords, view these letters full of bad mischance.</LINE>
<LINE>France is revolted from the English quite,</LINE>
<LINE>Except some petty towns of no import.</LINE>
<LINE>The Dauphin Charles is crowned king in Rheims;</LINE>
<LINE>The Bastard of Orleance with him is join&#8217;d;</LINE>
<LINE>Reignier, Duke of Anjou, doth take his part;</LINE>
<LINE>The Duke of Alanson flieth to his side.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EXE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The Dauphin crowned king? All fly to him?</LINE>
<LINE>O, whither shall we fly from this reproach?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We will not fly but to our enemies&#8217; throats.</LINE>
<LINE>Bedford, if thou be slack, I&#8217;ll fight it out.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BED.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Gloucester, why doubt&#8217;st thou of my forwardness?</LINE>
<LINE>An army have I muster&#8217;d in my thoughts,</LINE>
<LINE>Wherewith already France is overrun.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter another Messenger.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>3. MESS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My gracious lords, to add to your laments,</LINE>
<LINE>Wherewith you now bedew King Henry&#8217;s hearse,</LINE>
<LINE>I must inform you of a dismal fight</LINE>
<LINE>Betwixt the stout Lord Talbot and the French.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WIN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What? Wherein Talbot overcame, is&#8217;t so?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>3. MESS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O no; wherein Lord Talbot was o&#8217;er-thrown.</LINE>
<LINE>The circumstance I&#8217;ll tell you more at large.</LINE>
<LINE>The tenth of August last this dreadful lord,</LINE>
<LINE>Retiring from the siege of Orleance,</LINE>
<LINE>Having full scarce six thousand in his troop,</LINE>
<LINE>By three and twenty thousand of the French</LINE>
<LINE>Was round encompassed, and set upon.</LINE>
<LINE>No leisure had he to enrank his men;</LINE>
<LINE>He wanted pikes to set before his archers;</LINE>
<LINE>In stead whereof sharp stakes pluck&#8217;d out of hedges</LINE>
<LINE>They pitched in the ground confusedly,</LINE>
<LINE>To keep the horsemen off from breaking in.</LINE>
<LINE>More than three hours the fight continued,</LINE>
<LINE>Where valiant Talbot above human thought</LINE>
<LINE>Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:</LINE>
<LINE>Hundreds he sent to hell, and none durst stand him;</LINE>
<LINE>Here, there, and every where, enrag&#8217;d he slew.</LINE>
<LINE>The French exclaim&#8217;d, the devil was in arms;</LINE>
<LINE>All the whole army stood agaz&#8217;d on him.</LINE>
<LINE>His soldiers, spying his undaunted spirit,</LINE>
<LINE>&#8220;A Talbot! A Talbot!&#8221; cried out amain,</LINE>
<LINE>And rush&#8217;d into the bowels of the battle.</LINE>
<LINE>Here had the conquest fully been seal&#8217;d up,</LINE>
<LINE>If Sir John Falstaff had not play&#8217;d the coward.</LINE>
<LINE>He, being in the vaward, plac&#8217;d behind</LINE>
<LINE>With purpose to relieve and follow them,</LINE>
<LINE>Cowardly fled, not having struck one stroke.</LINE>
<LINE>Hence grew the general wrack and massacre;</LINE>
<LINE>Enclosed were they with their enemies.</LINE>
<LINE>A base Wallon, to win the Dauphin&#8217;s grace,</LINE>
<LINE>Thrust Talbot with a spear into the back,</LINE>
<LINE>Whom all France with their chief assembled strength</LINE>
<LINE>Durst not presume to look once in the face.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BED.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is Talbot slain then? I will slay myself</LINE>
<LINE>For living idly here in pomp and ease,</LINE>
<LINE>Whilst such a worthy leader, wanting aid,</LINE>
<LINE>Unto his dastard foemen is betray&#8217;d.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>3. MESS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O no, he lives, but is took prisoner,</LINE>
<LINE>And Lord Scales with him, and Lord Hungerford.</LINE>
<LINE>Most of the rest slaughter&#8217;d or took likewise.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BED.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>His ransom there is none but I shall pay:</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll hale the Dauphin headlong from his throne,</LINE>
<LINE>His crown shall be the ransom of my friend;</LINE>
<LINE>Four of their lords I&#8217;ll change for one of ours.</LINE>
<LINE>Farewell, my masters, to my task will I.</LINE>
<LINE>Bonfires in France forthwith I am to make,</LINE>
<LINE>To keep our great Saint George&#8217;s feast withal.</LINE>
<LINE>Ten thousand soldiers with me I will take,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose bloody deeds shall make all Europe quake.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>3. MESS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So you had need, for Orleance is besieg&#8217;d;</LINE>
<LINE>The English army is grown weak and faint;</LINE>
<LINE>The Earl of Salisbury craveth supply,</LINE>
<LINE>And hardly keeps his men from mutiny,</LINE>
<LINE>Since they, so few, watch such a multitude.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EXE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Remember, lords, your oaths to Henry sworn:</LINE>
<LINE>Either to quell the Dauphin utterly,</LINE>
<LINE>Or bring him in obedience to your yoke.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BED.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do remember it, and here take my leave,</LINE>
<LINE>To go about my preparation.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit Bedford.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll to the Tower with all the haste I can,</LINE>
<LINE>To view th&#8217; artillery and munition,</LINE>
<LINE>And then I will proclaim young Henry king.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit Gloucester.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EXE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To Eltam will I, where the young King is,</LINE>
<LINE>Being ordain&#8217;d his special governor,</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Each hath his place and function to attend:</LINE>
<LINE>I am left out; for me nothing remains.</LINE>

<LINE>Let&#8217;s leave this town, for they are hare-brain&#8217;d slaves,</LINE>

<LINE>A holy maid hither with me I bring,</LINE>
<LINE>Which by a vision sent to her from heaven</LINE>
<LINE>Ordained is to raise this tedious siege,</LINE>

<LINE>The spirit of deep prophecy she hath,</LINE>

<SPEAKER>PLAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Great lords and gentlemen, what means this silence?</LINE>
<LINE>Dare no man answer in a case of truth?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Within the Temple Hall we were too loud,</LINE>
<LINE>The garden here is more convenient.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PLAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then say at once if I maintain&#8217;d the truth;</LINE>
<LINE>Or else was wrangling Somerset in th&#8217; error?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Faith, I have been a truant in the law,</LINE>
<LINE>And never yet could frame my will to it,</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore frame the law unto my will.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SOM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Judge you, my Lord of Warwick, then between us.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Between two hawks, which flies the higher pitch,</LINE>
<LINE>Between two dogs, which hath the deeper mouth,</LINE>
<LINE>Between two blades, which bears the better temper,</LINE>
<LINE>Between two horses, which doth bear him best,</LINE>
<LINE>Between two girls, which hath the merriest eye&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>I have perhaps some shallow spirit of judgment;</LINE>
<LINE>But in these nice sharp quillets of the law,</LINE>
<LINE>Good faith, I am no wiser than a daw.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PLAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tut, tut, here is a mannerly forbearance.</LINE>
<LINE>The truth appears so naked on my side</LINE>
<LINE>That any purblind eye may find it out.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SOM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And on my side it is so well apparell&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>So clear, so shining, and so evident,</LINE>
<LINE>That it will glimmer through a blindman&#8217;s eye.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PLAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Since you are tongue-tied and so loath to speak,</LINE>
<LINE>In dumb significants proclaim your thoughts:</LINE>
<LINE>Let him that is a true-born gentleman</LINE>
<LINE>And stands upon the honor of his birth,</LINE>
<LINE>If he suppose that I have pleaded truth,</LINE>
<LINE>From off this brier pluck a white rose with me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SOM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let him that is no coward nor no flatterer,</LINE>
<LINE>But dare maintain the party of the truth,</LINE>
<LINE>Pluck a red rose from off this thorn with me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I love no colors; and without all color</LINE>
<LINE>Of base insinuating flattery,</LINE>
<LINE>I pluck this white rose with Plantagenet.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I pluck this red rose with young Somerset,</LINE>
<LINE>And say withal, I think he held the right.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Stay, lords and gentlemen, and pluck no more,</LINE>
<LINE>Till you conclude that he upon whose side</LINE>
<LINE>The fewest roses are cropp&#8217;d from the tree</LINE>
<LINE>Shall yield the other in the right opinion.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SOM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good Master Vernon, it is well objected;</LINE>
<LINE>If I have fewest, I subscribe in silence.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PLAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And I.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then for the truth and plainness of the case,</LINE>
<LINE>I pluck this pale and maiden blossom here,</LINE>
<LINE>Giving my verdict on the white rose side.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SOM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Prick not your finger as you pluck it off,</LINE>
<LINE>Lest, bleeding, you do paint the white rose red,</LINE>
<LINE>And fall on my side so against your will.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If I, my lord, for my opinion bleed,</LINE>
<LINE>Opinion shall be surgeon to my hurt,</LINE>
<LINE>And keep me on the side where still I am.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SOM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, well, come on, who else?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAW.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Unless my study and my books be false,</LINE>
<LINE>The argument you held was wrong in you;</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>To Somerset.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>In sign whereof I pluck a white rose too.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PLAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, Somerset, where is your argument?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SOM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here in my scabbard, meditating that</LINE>
<LINE>Shall dye your white rose in a bloody red.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PLAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Mean time your cheeks do counterfeit our roses;</LINE>
<LINE>For pale they look with fear, as witnessing</LINE>
<LINE>The truth on our side.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SOM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">No, Plantagenet;</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis not for fear, but anger, that thy cheeks</LINE>
<LINE>Blush for pure shame to counterfeit our roses,</LINE>
<LINE>And yet thy tongue will not confess thy error.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PLAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hath not thy rose a canker, Somerset?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SOM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hath not thy rose a thorn, Plantagenet?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PLAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, sharp and piercing, to maintain his truth,</LINE>
<LINE>Whiles thy consuming canker eats his falsehood.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SOM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, I&#8217;ll find friends to wear my bleeding roses,</LINE>
<LINE>That shall maintain what I have said is true,</LINE>
<LINE>Where false Plantagenet dare not be seen.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PLAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, by this maiden blossom in my hand,</LINE>
<LINE>I scorn thee and thy fashion, peevish boy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Turn not thy scorns this way, Plantagenet.</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Proud Pole, I will, and scorn both him and thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Now, by God&#8217;s will, thou wrong&#8217;st him, Somerset;</LINE>
<LINE>His grandfather was Lionel Duke of Clarence,</LINE>
<LINE>Third son to the third Edward, King of England.</LINE>
<LINE>Spring crestless yeomen from so deep a root?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>He bears him on the place&#8217;s privilege,</LINE>
<LINE>Or durst not for his craven heart say thus.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SOM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By Him that made me, I&#8217;ll maintain my words</LINE>
<LINE>On any plot of ground in Christendom.</LINE>
<LINE>Was not thy father, Richard Earl of Cambridge,</LINE>
<LINE>For treason executed in our late king&#8217;s days?</LINE>
<LINE>And by his treason, stand&#8217;st not thou attainted,</LINE>
<LINE>Corrupted, and exempt from ancient gentry?</LINE>
<LINE>His trespass yet lives guilty in thy blood,</LINE>
<LINE>And till thou be restor&#8217;d, thou art a yeoman.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PLAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My father was attached, not attainted,</LINE>
<LINE>Condemn&#8217;d to die for treason, but no traitor;</LINE>
<LINE>And that I&#8217;ll prove on better men than Somerset,</LINE>
<LINE>Were growing time once ripened to my will.</LINE>
<LINE>For your partaker Pole, and you yourself,</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll note you in my book of memory,</LINE>
<LINE>To scourge you for this apprehension.</LINE>
<LINE>Look to it well, and say you are well warn&#8217;d.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SOM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ah, thou shalt find us ready for thee still;</LINE>
<LINE>And know us by these colors for thy foes,</LINE>
<LINE>For these my friends in spite of thee shall wear.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PLAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And, by my soul, this pale and angry rose,</LINE>
<LINE>As cognizance of my blood-drinking hate,</LINE>
<LINE>Will I forever and my faction wear,</LINE>
<LINE>Until it wither with me to my grave,</LINE>
<LINE>Or flourish to the height of my degree.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>Mean time, in signal of my love to thee,</LINE>
<LINE>Against proud Somerset and William Pole,</LINE>
<LINE>Will I upon thy party wear this rose.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>MOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Kind keepers of my weak decaying age,</LINE>
<LINE>Let dying Mortimer here rest himself.</LINE>
<LINE>Even like a man new haled from the rack,</LINE>
<LINE>So fare my limbs with long imprisonment;</LINE>
<LINE>And these grey locks, the pursuivants of death,</LINE>
<LINE>Nestor-like aged, in an age of care,</LINE>
<LINE>Argue the end of Edmund Mortimer.</LINE>
<LINE>These eyes, like lamps whose wasting oil is spent,</LINE>
<LINE>Wax dim, as drawing to their exigent;</LINE>
<LINE>Weak shoulders, overborne with burdening grief,</LINE>
<LINE>And pithless arms, like to a withered vine</LINE>
<LINE>That droops his sapless branches to the ground.</LINE>
<LINE>Yet are these feet, whose strengthless stay is numb</LINE>
<LINE>(Unable to support this lump of clay),</LINE>
<LINE>Swift-winged with desire to get a grave,</LINE>
<LINE>As witting I no other comfort have.</LINE>
<LINE>But tell me, keeper, will my nephew come?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. KEEPER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Richard Plantagenet, my lord, will come.</LINE>
<LINE>We sent unto the Temple, unto his chamber,</LINE>
<LINE>And answer was return&#8217;d that he will come.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Enough; my soul shall then be satisfied.</LINE>
<LINE>Poor gentleman, his wrong doth equal mine.</LINE>
<LINE>Since Henry Monmouth first began to reign,</LINE>
<LINE>Before whose glory I was great in arms,</LINE>
<LINE>This loathsome sequestration have I had;</LINE>
<LINE>And even since then hath Richard been obscur&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Depriv&#8217;d of honor and inheritance.</LINE>
<LINE>But now, the arbitrator of despairs,</LINE>
<LINE>Just Death, kind umpire of men&#8217;s miseries,</LINE>
<LINE>With sweet enlargement doth dismiss me hence.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>MOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Richard Plantagenet, my friend, is he come?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PLAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, noble uncle, thus ignobly us&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Your nephew, late-despised Richard, comes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Direct mine arms I may embrace his neck,</LINE>
<LINE>And in his bosom spend my latter gasp.</LINE>
<LINE>O, tell me when my lips do touch his cheeks,</LINE>
<LINE>That I may kindly give one fainting kiss.</LINE>
<LINE>And now declare, sweet stem from York&#8217;s great stock,</LINE>
<LINE>Why didst thou say, of late thou wert despis&#8217;d?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PLAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>First, lean thine aged back against mine arm,</LINE>
<LINE>And in that ease, I&#8217;ll tell thee my disease.</LINE>
<LINE>This day, in argument upon a case,</LINE>
<LINE>Some words there grew &#8217;twixt Somerset and me;</LINE>
<LINE>Among which terms he us&#8217;d his lavish tongue</LINE>
<LINE>And did upbraid me with my father&#8217;s death;</LINE>
<LINE>Which obloquy set bars before my tongue,</LINE>
<LINE>Else with the like I had requited him.</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore, good uncle, for my father&#8217;s sake,</LINE>
<LINE>In honor of a true Plantagenet,</LINE>
<LINE>And for alliance sake, declare the cause</LINE>
<LINE>My father, Earl of Cambridge, lost his head.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That cause, fair nephew, that imprison&#8217;d me</LINE>
<LINE>And hath detain&#8217;d me all my flow&#8217;ring youth</LINE>
<LINE>Within a loathsome dungeon, there to pine,</LINE>
<LINE>Was cursed instrument of his decease.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PLAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Discover more at large what cause that was,</LINE>
<LINE>For I am ignorant and cannot guess.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will, if that my fading breath permit</LINE>
<LINE>And death approach not ere my tale be done.</LINE>
<LINE>Henry the Fourth, grandfather to this king,</LINE>
<LINE>Depos&#8217;d his nephew Richard, Edward&#8217;s son,</LINE>
<LINE>The first begotten, and the lawful heir</LINE>
<LINE>Of Edward king, the third of that descent;</LINE>
<LINE>During whose reign the Percies of the north,</LINE>
<LINE>Finding his usurpation most unjust,</LINE>
<LINE>Endeavor&#8217;d my advancement to the throne.</LINE>
<LINE>The reason mov&#8217;d these warlike lords to this</LINE>
<LINE>Was, for that (young Richard thus remov&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Leaving no heir begotten of his body)</LINE>
<LINE>I was the next by birth and parentage;</LINE>
<LINE>For by my mother I derived am</LINE>
<LINE>From Lionel Duke of Clarence, third son</LINE>
<LINE>To King Edward the Third; whereas he</LINE>
<LINE>From John of Gaunt doth bring his pedigree,</LINE>
<LINE>Being but fourth of that heroic line.</LINE>
<LINE>But mark: as in this haughty great attempt</LINE>
<LINE>They labored to plant the rightful heir,</LINE>
<LINE>I lost my liberty, and they their lives.</LINE>
<LINE>Long after this, when Henry the Fifth</LINE>
<LINE>(Succeeding his father Bullingbrook) did reign,</LINE>
<LINE>Thy father, Earl of Cambridge then, deriv&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>From famous Edmund Langley, Duke of York,</LINE>
<LINE>Marrying my sister that thy mother was,</LINE>
<LINE>Again, in pity of my hard distress,</LINE>
<LINE>Levied an army, weening to redeem</LINE>
<LINE>And have install&#8217;d me in the diadem.</LINE>
<LINE>But as the rest, so fell that noble earl,</LINE>
<LINE>And was beheaded. Thus the Mortimers,</LINE>
<LINE>In whom the title rested, were suppress&#8217;d.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PLAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Of which, my lord, your honor is the last.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>True; and thou seest that I no issue have,</LINE>
<LINE>And that my fainting words do warrant death.</LINE>
<LINE>Thou art my heir; the rest I wish thee gather;</LINE>
<LINE>But yet be wary in thy studious care.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PLAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thy grave admonishments prevail with me.</LINE>
<LINE>But yet methinks, my father&#8217;s execution</LINE>
<LINE>Was nothing less than bloody tyranny.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>With silence, nephew, be thou politic.</LINE>
<LINE>Strong fixed is the house of Lancaster,</LINE>
<LINE>And like a mountain, not to be remov&#8217;d.</LINE>
<LINE>But now thy uncle is removing hence,</LINE>
<LINE>As princes do their courts, when they are cloy&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>With long continuance in a settled place.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PLAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O uncle, would some part of my young years</LINE>
<LINE>Might but redeem the passage of your age!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou dost then wrong me, as that slaughterer doth</LINE>
<LINE>Which giveth many wounds when one will kill.</LINE>
<LINE>Mourn not, except thou sorrow for my good,</LINE>
<LINE>Only give order for my funeral.</LINE>
<LINE>And so farewell, and fair be all thy hopes,</LINE>
<LINE>And prosperous be thy life in peace and war!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Dies.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PLAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And peace, no war, befall thy parting soul!</LINE>
<LINE>In prison hast thou spent a pilgrimage,</LINE>
<LINE>And like a hermit overpass&#8217;d thy days.</LINE>
<LINE>Well, I will lock his counsel in my breast,</LINE>
<LINE>And what I do imagine, let that rest.</LINE>
<LINE>Keepers, convey him hence, and I myself</LINE>
<LINE>Will see his burial better than his life.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt Keepers, bearing out the body of Mortimer.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Here dies the dusky torch of Mortimer,</LINE>
<LINE>Chok&#8217;d with ambition of the meaner sort;</LINE>
<LINE>And for those wrongs, those bitter injuries,</LINE>
<LINE>Which Somerset hath offer&#8217;d to my house,</LINE>
<LINE>I doubt not but with honor to redress.</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore haste I to the parliament,</LINE>

<LINE>Dismay not, princes, at this accident,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor grieve that Roan is so recovered:</LINE>
<LINE>Care is no cure, but rather corrosive,</LINE>
<LINE>For things that are not to be remedied.</LINE>
<LINE>Let frantic Talbot triumph for a while,</LINE>

<LINE>We&#8217;ll pull his plumes and take away his train,</LINE>
<LINE>If Dauphin and the rest will be but rul&#8217;d.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then thus it must be, this doth Joan devise:</LINE>
<LINE>By fair persuasions, mix&#8217;d with sug&#8217;red words,</LINE>
<LINE>We will entice the Duke of Burgundy</LINE>
<LINE>To leave the Talbot and to follow us.</LINE>

<LINE>Ay, marry, sweeting, if we could do that,</LINE>
<LINE>France were no place for Henry&#8217;s warriors,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor should that nation boast it so with us,</LINE>

<LINE>For ever should they be expuls&#8217;d from France,</LINE>

<LINE>Speak on, but be not over-tedious.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Look on thy country, look on fertile France,</LINE>

<LINE>As looks the mother on her lowly babe</LINE>
<LINE>When death doth close his tender-dying eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>See, see the pining malady of France!</LINE>
<LINE>Behold the wounds, the most unnatural wounds,</LINE>
<LINE>Which thou thyself hast given her woeful breast.</LINE>
<LINE>O, turn the edged sword another way,</LINE>
<LINE>Strike those that hurt, and hurt not those that help.</LINE>
<LINE>One drop of blood drawn from thy country&#8217;s bosom</LINE>
<LINE>Should grieve thee more than streams of foreign gore.</LINE>
<LINE>Return thee therefore with a flood of tears,</LINE>
<LINE>And wash away thy country&#8217;s stained spots.</LINE>

<LINE>Besides, all French and France exclaims on thee,</LINE>

<LINE>Who join&#8217;st thou with, but with a lordly nation</LINE>
<LINE>That will not trust thee but for profit&#8217;s sake?</LINE>
<LINE>When Talbot hath set footing once in France</LINE>
<LINE>And fashion&#8217;d thee that instrument of ill,</LINE>
<LINE>Who then but English Henry will be lord,</LINE>
<LINE>And thou be thrust out like a fugitive?</LINE>
<LINE>Call we to mind, and mark but this for proof:</LINE>
<LINE>Was not the Duke of Orleance thy foe?</LINE>
<LINE>And was he not in England prisoner?</LINE>
<LINE>But when they heard he was thine enemy,</LINE>
<LINE>They set him free without his ransom paid,</LINE>
<LINE>In spite of Burgundy and all his friends.</LINE>
<LINE>See then, thou fight&#8217;st against thy countrymen</LINE>
<LINE>And join&#8217;st with them will be thy slaughter-men.</LINE>
<LINE>Come, come, return; return, thou wandering lord!</LINE>
<LINE>Charles and the rest will take thee in their arms.</LINE>

<LINE>My gracious sovereign, as I rode from Callice,</LINE>

<LINE>A letter was deliver&#8217;d to my hands,</LINE>
<LINE>Writ to your Grace from th&#8217; Duke of Burgundy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Presents it.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Shame to the Duke of Burgundy and thee!</LINE>
<LINE>I vow&#8217;d, base knight, when I did meet thee next,</LINE>
<LINE>To tear the Garter from thy craven&#8217;s leg,</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Plucking it off.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Which I have done, because (unworthily)</LINE>
<LINE>Thou wast installed in that high degree.</LINE>
<LINE>Pardon me, princely Henry, and the rest.</LINE>
<LINE>This dastard, at the battle of Poictiers,</LINE>
<LINE>When (but in all) I was six thousand strong</LINE>
<LINE>And that the French were almost ten to one,</LINE>
<LINE>Before we met, or that a stroke was given,</LINE>
<LINE>Like to a trusty squire did run away;</LINE>
<LINE>In which assault we lost twelve hundred men;</LINE>
<LINE>Myself and divers gentlemen beside</LINE>
<LINE>Were there surpris&#8217;d and taken prisoners.</LINE>
<LINE>Then judge, great lords, if I have done amiss;</LINE>
<LINE>Or whether that such cowards ought to wear</LINE>
<LINE>This ornament of knighthood, yea or no?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To say the truth, this fact was infamous</LINE>
<LINE>And ill beseeming any common man,</LINE>
<LINE>Much more a knight, a captain, and a leader.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>When first this order was ordain&#8217;d, my lords,</LINE>
<LINE>Knights of the Garter were of noble birth,</LINE>
<LINE>Valiant and virtuous, full of haughty courage,</LINE>
<LINE>Such as were grown to credit by the wars;</LINE>
<LINE>Not fearing death, nor shrinking for distress,</LINE>
<LINE>But always resolute in most extremes.</LINE>
<LINE>He then, that is not furnish&#8217;d in this sort,</LINE>
<LINE>Doth but usurp the sacred name of knight,</LINE>
<LINE>Profaning this most honorable order,</LINE>
<LINE>And should (if I were worthy to be judge)</LINE>
<LINE>Be quite degraded, like a hedge-born swain</LINE>
<LINE>That doth presume to boast of gentle blood.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Stain to thy countrymen, thou hear&#8217;st thy doom!</LINE>
<LINE>Be packing therefore, thou that wast a knight;</LINE>
<LINE>Henceforth we banish thee, on pain of death.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exit Falstaff.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>And now, Lord Protector, view the letter</LINE>
<LINE>Sent from our uncle Duke of Burgundy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What means his Grace, that he hath chang&#8217;d his style?</LINE>
<LINE>No more but plain and bluntly &#8220;To the King&#8221;?</LINE>
<LINE>Hath he forgot he is his sovereign?</LINE>
<LINE>Or doth this churlish superscription</LINE>
<LINE>Pretend some alteration in good will?</LINE>
<LINE>What&#8217;s here?</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Reads.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>&#8220;I have, upon especial cause,</LINE>
<LINE>Mov&#8217;d with compassion of my country&#8217;s wrack,</LINE>
<LINE>Together with the pitiful complaints</LINE>
<LINE>Of such as your oppression feeds upon,</LINE>
<LINE>Forsaken your pernicious faction</LINE>
<LINE>And join&#8217;d with Charles, the rightful King of France.&#8221;</LINE>
<LINE>O monstrous treachery! Can this be so?</LINE>
<LINE>That in alliance, amity, and oaths,</LINE>
<LINE>There should be found such false dissembling guile?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What? Doth my uncle Burgundy revolt?</LINE>

<SPEAKER>GLOU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is the worst, and all, my lord, he writes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why then Lord Talbot there shall talk with him,</LINE>
<LINE>And give him chastisement for this abuse.</LINE>
<LINE>How say you, my lord? Are you not content?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Content, my liege? Yes. But that I am prevented,</LINE>
<LINE>I should have begg&#8217;d I might have been employ&#8217;d.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then gather strength and march unto him straight.</LINE>

<LINE>Say, gentlemen, what makes you thus exclaim?</LINE>
<LINE>And wherefore crave you combat? Or with whom?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>With him, my lord, for he hath done me wrong.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And I with him, for he hath done me wrong.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What is that wrong whereof you both complain?</LINE>
<LINE>First let me know, and then I&#8217;ll answer you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Crossing the sea from England into France,</LINE>
<LINE>This fellow here, with envious carping tongue,</LINE>
<LINE>Upbraided me about the rose I wear,</LINE>
<LINE>Saying the sanguine color of the leaves</LINE>
<LINE>Did represent my master&#8217;s blushing cheeks,</LINE>
<LINE>When stubbornly he did repugn the truth</LINE>
<LINE>About a certain question in the law</LINE>
<LINE>Argu&#8217;d betwixt the Duke of York and him;</LINE>
<LINE>With other vile and ignominious terms:</LINE>
<LINE>In confutation of which rude reproach,</LINE>
<LINE>And in defense of my lord&#8217;s worthiness,</LINE>
<LINE>I crave the benefit of law of arms.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And that is my petition, noble lord.</LINE>
<LINE>For though he seem with forged quaint conceit</LINE>
<LINE>To set a gloss upon his bold intent,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet know, my lord, I was provok&#8217;d by him,</LINE>
<LINE>And he first took exceptions at this badge,</LINE>
<LINE>Pronouncing that the paleness of this flower</LINE>
<LINE>Bewray&#8217;d the faintness of my master&#8217;s heart.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Will not this malice, Somerset, be left?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SOM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your private grudge, my Lord of York, will out,</LINE>
<LINE>Though ne&#8217;er so cunningly you smother it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good Lord, what madness rules in brain-sick men,</LINE>
<LINE>When for so slight and frivolous a cause</LINE>
<LINE>Such factious emulations shall arise!</LINE>
<LINE>Good cousins both, of York and Somerset,</LINE>
<LINE>Quiet yourselves, I pray, and be at peace.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let this dissension first be tried by fight,</LINE>
<LINE>And then your Highness shall command a peace.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SOM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The quarrel toucheth none but us alone,</LINE>
<LINE>Betwixt ourselves let us decide it then.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There is my pledge, accept it, Somerset.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, let it rest where it began at first.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Confirm it so, mine honorable lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Confirm it so? Confounded be your strife,</LINE>
<LINE>And perish ye, with your audacious prate!</LINE>
<LINE>Presumptuous vassals, are you not asham&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>With this immodest clamorous outrage</LINE>
<LINE>To trouble and disturb the King and us?</LINE>
<LINE>And you, my lords, methinks you do not well</LINE>
<LINE>To bear with their perverse objections;</LINE>
<LINE>Much less to take occasion from their mouths</LINE>
<LINE>To raise a mutiny betwixt yourselves.</LINE>
<LINE>Let me persuade you take a better course.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EXE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It grieves his Highness. Good my lords, be friends.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come hither, you that would be combatants:</LINE>
<LINE>Henceforth I charge you, as you love our favor,</LINE>
<LINE>Quite to forget this quarrel, and the cause.</LINE>
<LINE>And you, my lords: remember where we are&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>In France, amongst a fickle, wavering nation.</LINE>
<LINE>If they perceive dissension in our looks,</LINE>
<LINE>And that within ourselves we disagree,</LINE>
<LINE>How will their grudging stomachs be provok&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>To willful disobedience, and rebel!</LINE>
<LINE>Beside, what infamy will there arise,</LINE>
<LINE>When foreign princes shall be certified</LINE>
<LINE>That for a toy, a thing of no regard,</LINE>
<LINE>King Henry&#8217;s peers and chief nobility</LINE>
<LINE>Destroy&#8217;d themselves, and lost the realm of France!</LINE>
<LINE>O, think upon the conquest of my father,</LINE>
<LINE>My tender years, and let us not forgo</LINE>
<LINE>That for a trifle that was bought with blood!</LINE>
<LINE>Let me be umpeer in this doubtful strife.</LINE>
<LINE>I see no reason, if I wear this rose,</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Putting on a red rose.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>That any one should therefore be suspicious</LINE>
<LINE>I more incline to Somerset than York:</LINE>
<LINE>Both are my kinsmen, and I love them both.</LINE>
<LINE>As well they may upbraid me with my crown,</LINE>
<LINE>Because, forsooth, the King of Scots is crown&#8217;d.</LINE>
<LINE>But your discretions better can persuade</LINE>
<LINE>Than I am able to instruct or teach;</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore, as we hither came in peace,</LINE>
<LINE>So let us still continue peace, and love.</LINE>
<LINE>Cousin of York, we institute your Grace</LINE>
<LINE>To be our regent in these parts of France;</LINE>
<LINE>And, good my Lord of Somerset, unite</LINE>
<LINE>Your troops of horsemen with his bands of foot,</LINE>
<LINE>And like true subjects, sons of your progenitors,</LINE>
<LINE>Go cheerfully together and digest</LINE>
<LINE>Your angry choler on your enemies.</LINE>
<LINE>Ourself, my Lord Protector, and the rest,</LINE>
<LINE>After some respite, will return to Callice;</LINE>
<LINE>From thence to England, where I hope ere long</LINE>
<LINE>To be presented, by your victories,</LINE>

<LINE>You, his false hopes, the trust of England&#8217;s honor,</LINE>

<LINE>Let not your private discord keep away</LINE>

<LINE>Upon my death the French can little boast;</LINE>
<LINE>In yours they will, in you all hopes are lost.</LINE>
<LINE>Flight cannot stain the honor you have won,</LINE>
<LINE>But mine it will, that no exploit have done.</LINE>
<LINE>You fled for vantage, every one will swear;</LINE>
<LINE>But if I bow, they&#8217;ll say it was for fear.</LINE>
<LINE>There is no hope that ever I will stay,</LINE>
<LINE>If the first hour I shrink and run away.</LINE>
<LINE>Here on my knee I beg mortality,</LINE>
<LINE>Rather than life preserv&#8217;d with infamy.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Had York and Somerset brought rescue in,</LINE>
<LINE>We should have found a bloody day of this.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How the young whelp of Talbot&#8217;s, raging wood,</LINE>
<LINE>Did flesh his puny sword in Frenchmen&#8217;s blood!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Once I encount&#8217;red him, and thus I said:</LINE>
<LINE>&#8220;Thou maiden youth, be vanquish&#8217;d by a maid!&#8221;</LINE>
<LINE>But with a proud majestical high scorn</LINE>
<LINE>He answer&#8217;d thus: &#8220;Young Talbot was not born</LINE>
<LINE>To be the pillage of a giglot wench.&#8221;</LINE>
<LINE>So rushing in the bowels of the French,</LINE>
<LINE>He left me proudly, as unworthy fight.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BUR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Doubtless he would have made a noble knight.</LINE>
<LINE>See where he lies inhearsed in the arms</LINE>
<LINE>Of the most bloody nurser of his harms!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hew them to pieces, hack their bones asunder,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose life was England&#8217;s glory, Gallia&#8217;s wonder.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O no, forbear! For that which we have fled</LINE>
<LINE>During the life, let us not wrong it dead.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Lucy attended, Herald of the French preceding.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Herald, conduct me to the Dauphin&#8217;s tent,</LINE>
<LINE>To know who hath obtain&#8217;d the glory of the day.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>On what submissive message art thou sent?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Submission, Dauphin? &#8217;tis a mere French word;</LINE>
<LINE>We English warriors wot not what it means.</LINE>
<LINE>I come to know what prisoners thou hast ta&#8217;en,</LINE>
<LINE>And to survey the bodies of the dead.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For prisoners ask&#8217;st thou? Hell our prison is.</LINE>
<LINE>But tell me whom thou seek&#8217;st.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But where&#8217;s the great Alcides of the field,</LINE>
<LINE>Valiant Lord Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury,</LINE>
<LINE>Created, for his rare success in arms,</LINE>
<LINE>Great Earl of Washford, Waterford, and Valence,</LINE>
<LINE>Lord Talbot of Goodrig and Urchinfield,</LINE>
<LINE>Lord Strange of Blackmere, Lord Verdon of Alton,</LINE>
<LINE>Lord Cromwell of Wingfield, Lord Furnival of Sheffield,</LINE>
<LINE>The thrice-victorious Lord of Falconbridge,</LINE>
<LINE>Knight of the noble Order of Saint George,</LINE>
<LINE>Worthy Saint Michael, and the Golden Fleece,</LINE>
<LINE>Great marshal to Henry the Sixth</LINE>
<LINE>Of all his wars within the realm of France?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here&#8217;s a silly stately style indeed!</LINE>
<LINE>The Turk, that two and fifty kingdoms hath,</LINE>
<LINE>Writes not so tedious a style as this.</LINE>
<LINE>Him that thou magnifi&#8217;st with all these titles</LINE>
<LINE>Stinking and fly-blown lies here at our feet.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is Talbot slain, the Frenchmen&#8217;s only scourge,</LINE>
<LINE>Your kingdom&#8217;s terror and black Nemesis?</LINE>
<LINE>O, were mine eyeballs into bullets turn&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>That I in rage might shoot them at your faces!</LINE>
<LINE>O, that I could but call these dead to life,</LINE>
<LINE>It were enough to fright the realm of France!</LINE>
<LINE>Were but his picture left amongst you here,</LINE>
<LINE>It would amaze the proudest of you all.</LINE>
<LINE>Give me their bodies, that I may bear them hence</LINE>
<LINE>And give them burial as beseems their worth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I think this upstart is old Talbot&#8217;s ghost,</LINE>
<LINE>He speaks with such a proud commanding spirit.</LINE>
<LINE>For God&#8217;s sake let him have &#8217;em; to keep them here,</LINE>
<LINE>They would but stink, and putrefy the air.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go take their bodies hence.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll bear them hence; but from their ashes shall be rear&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>A phoenix that shall make all France afeard.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So we be rid of them, do with &#8217;em what thou wilt.</LINE>
<LINE>And now to Paris in this conquering vein,</LINE>
<LINE>All will be ours, now bloody Talbot&#8217;s slain.</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, marry, uncle, for I always thought</LINE>
<LINE>It was both impious and unnatural</LINE>
<LINE>That such immanity and bloody strife</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marriage, uncle? Alas, my years are young;</LINE>

<LINE>What, is my Lord of Winchester install&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>And call&#8217;d unto a cardinal&#8217;s degree?</LINE>
<LINE>Then I perceive that will be verified</LINE>
<LINE>Henry the Fifth did sometime prophesy:</LINE>
<LINE>&#8220;If once he come to be a cardinal,</LINE>
<LINE>He&#8217;ll make his cap co-equal with the crown.&#8221;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lords ambassadors, your several suits</LINE>

<LINE>He doth intend she shall be England&#8217;s queen.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In argument and proof of which contract,</LINE>
<LINE>Bear her this jewel, pledge of my affection.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>WIN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now Winchester will not submit, I trow,</LINE>

<LINE>Humphrey of Gloucester, thou shalt well perceive</LINE>
<LINE>That neither in birth, or for authority,</LINE>

<LINE>Now, ye familiar spirits, that are cull&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>Out of the powerful regions under earth,</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>They walk, and speak not.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>O, hold me not with silence over-long!</LINE>
<LINE>Where I was wont to feed you with my blood,</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll lop a member off and give it you</LINE>
<LINE>In earnest of a further benefit,</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>They hang their heads.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>No hope to have redress? My body shall</LINE>
<LINE>Pay recompense, if you will grant my suit.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>They shake their heads.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Cannot my body nor blood-sacrifice</LINE>
<LINE>Entreat you to your wonted furtherance?</LINE>
<LINE>Then take my soul&#8212;my body, soul, and all,</LINE>
<LINE>Before that England give the French the foil.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>They depart.</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>O fairest beauty, do not fear nor fly,</LINE>

<LINE>Be not offended, nature&#8217;s miracle,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou art allotted to be ta&#8217;en by me;</LINE>
<LINE>So doth the swan her downy cygnets save,</LINE>
<LINE>Keeping them prisoner underneath her wings.</LINE>
<LINE>Yet, if this servile usage once offend,</LINE>
<LINE>Go, and be free again, as Suffolk&#8217;s friend.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>She is going.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>O, stay!</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Aside.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE offset="2">I have no power to let her pass,</LINE>
<LINE>My hand would free her, but my heart says no.</LINE>
<LINE>As plays the sun upon the glassy streams,</LINE>
<LINE>Twinkling another counterfeited beam,</LINE>
<LINE>So seems this gorgeous beauty to mine eyes.</LINE>
<LINE>Fain would I woo her, yet I dare not speak:</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll call for pen and ink, and write my mind.</LINE>
<LINE>Fie, De la Pole, disable not thyself.</LINE>
<LINE>Hast not a tongue? Is she not here?</LINE>
<LINE>Wilt thou be daunted at a woman&#8217;s sight?</LINE>
<LINE>Ay; beauty&#8217;s princely majesty is such,</LINE>

<LINE>She&#8217;s beautiful; and therefore to be wooed:</LINE>

<LINE>And yet a dispensation may be had.</LINE>

<LINE>And yet I would that you would answer me.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUF.</SPEAKER>

<LINE>I&#8217;ll win this Lady Margaret. For whom?</LINE>
<LINE>Why, for my king. Tush, that&#8217;s a wooden thing!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He talks of wood; it is some carpenter.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUF.</SPEAKER>
<STAGEDIR>Aside.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Yet so my fancy may be satisfied,</LINE>
<LINE>And peace established between these realms.</LINE>
<LINE>But there remains a scruple in that too;</LINE>
<LINE>For though her father be the King of Naples,</LINE>
<LINE>Duke of Anjou and Maine, yet is he poor,</LINE>
<LINE>And our nobility will scorn the match.</LINE>

<LINE>Lady, vouchsafe to listen what I say.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<STAGEDIR>Aside.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Perhaps I shall be rescu&#8217;d by the French,</LINE>
<LINE>And then I need not crave his courtesy.</LINE>

<LINE>I cry you mercy, &#8217;tis but quid for quo.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Say, gentle Princess, would you not suppose</LINE>
<LINE>Your bondage happy, to be made a queen?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To be a queen in bondage is more vile</LINE>
<LINE>Than is a slave in base servility;</LINE>
<LINE>For princes should be free.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">And so shall you,</LINE>
<LINE>If happy England&#8217;s royal king be free.</LINE>

<LINE>Why, what concerns his freedom unto me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll undertake to make thee Henry&#8217;s queen,</LINE>
<LINE>To put a golden sceptre in thy hand,</LINE>

<LINE>If thou wilt condescend to be my&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">What?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>His love.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am unworthy to be Henry&#8217;s wife.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, gentle madam, I unworthy am</LINE>
<LINE>To woo so fair a dame to be his wife</LINE>
<LINE>And have no portion in the choice myself.</LINE>
<LINE>How say you, madam, are ye so content?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And if my father please, I am content.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then call our captains and our colors forth,</LINE>

<LINE>I am a soldier, and unapt to weep,</LINE>
<LINE>Or to exclaim on fortune&#8217;s fickleness.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, there is remedy enough, my lord.</LINE>
<LINE>Consent, and for thy honor give consent,</LINE>
<LINE>Thy daughter shall be wedded to my king,</LINE>
<LINE>Whom I with pain have wooed and won thereto;</LINE>
<LINE>And this her easy-held imprisonment</LINE>
<LINE>Hath gain&#8217;d thy daughter princely liberty.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REIG.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Speaks Suffolk as he thinks?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">Fair Margaret knows</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REIG.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Upon thy princely warrant, I descend</LINE>
<LINE>To give thee answer of thy just demand.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit from the walls.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REIG.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Welcome, brave Earl, into our territories!</LINE>
<LINE>Command in Anjou what your honor pleases.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thanks, Reignier, happy for so sweet a child,</LINE>
<LINE>Fit to be made companion with a king.</LINE>
<LINE>What answer makes your Grace unto my suit?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REIG.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Since thou dost deign to woo her little worth</LINE>
<LINE>To be the princely bride of such a lord,</LINE>
<LINE>Upon condition I may quietly</LINE>
<LINE>Enjoy mine own, the country Maine and Anjou,</LINE>
<LINE>Free from oppression or the stroke of war,</LINE>
<LINE>My daughter shall be Henry&#8217;s, if he please.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That is her ransom; I deliver her,</LINE>
<LINE>And those two counties I will undertake</LINE>
<LINE>Your Grace shall well and quietly enjoy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REIG.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And I again, in Henry&#8217;s royal name,</LINE>
<LINE>As deputy unto that gracious king,</LINE>
<LINE>Give thee her hand, for sign of plighted faith.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Reignier of France, I give thee kingly thanks,</LINE>
<LINE>Because this is in traffic of a king.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Aside.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>And yet methinks I could be well content</LINE>
<LINE>To be mine own attorney in this case.&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll over then to England with this news,</LINE>
<LINE>And make this marriage to be solemniz&#8217;d.</LINE>
<LINE>So farewell, Reignier! Set this diamond safe</LINE>
<LINE>In golden palaces, as it becomes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>REIG.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do embrace thee, as I would embrace</LINE>
<LINE>The Christian prince, King Henry, were he here.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Farewell, my lord! Good wishes, praise, and prayers</LINE>
<LINE>Shall Suffolk ever have of Margaret.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>She is going.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Farewell, sweet madam! But hark you, Margaret,</LINE>
<LINE>No princely commendations to my king?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Such commendations as becomes a maid,</LINE>
<LINE>A virgin, and his servant, say to him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Words sweetly plac&#8217;d and modestly directed.</LINE>
<LINE>But, madam, I must trouble you again,</LINE>
<LINE>No loving token to his Majesty?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, my good lord, a pure unspotted heart,</LINE>
<LINE>Never yet taint with love, I send the King.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Kiss her.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>That for thyself; I will not so presume</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt Reignier and Margaret.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, wert thou for myself! But, Suffolk, stay,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou mayest not wander in that labyrinth,</LINE>
<LINE>There Minotaurs and ugly treasons lurk.</LINE>
<LINE>Solicit Henry with her wondrous praise;</LINE>
<LINE>Bethink thee on her virtues that surmount,</LINE>
<LINE>And natural graces that extinguish art;</LINE>
<LINE>Repeat their semblance often on the seas,</LINE>
<LINE>That, when thou com&#8217;st to kneel at Henry&#8217;s feet,</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>First let me tell you whom you have condemn&#8217;d:</LINE>
<LINE>Not me begotten of a shepherd swain,</LINE>
<LINE>But issued from the progeny of kings;</LINE>
<LINE>Virtuous and holy, chosen from above,</LINE>
<LINE>By inspiration of celestial grace,</LINE>
<LINE>To work exceeding miracles on earth.</LINE>
<LINE>I never had to do with wicked spirits.</LINE>
<LINE>But you, that are polluted with your lusts,</LINE>
<LINE>Stain&#8217;d with the guiltless blood of innocents,</LINE>
<LINE>Corrupt and tainted with a thousand vices,</LINE>
<LINE>Because you want the grace that others have,</LINE>
<LINE>You judge it straight a thing impossible</LINE>
<LINE>To compass wonders but by help of devils.</LINE>
<LINE>No, misconceived! Joan of Aire hath been</LINE>
<LINE>A virgin from her tender infancy,</LINE>
<LINE>Chaste, and immaculate in very thought,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose maiden blood, thus rigorously effus&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Will cry for vengeance at the gates of heaven.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Ay, ay; away with her to execution!</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Lord Regent, I do greet your Excellence</LINE>
<LINE>With letters of commission from the King.</LINE>
<LINE>For know, my lords, the states of Christendom,</LINE>
<LINE>Mov&#8217;d with remorse of these outrageous broils,</LINE>
<LINE>Have earnestly implor&#8217;d a general peace</LINE>
<LINE>Betwixt our nation and the aspiring French;</LINE>
<LINE>And here at hand the Dauphin and his train</LINE>
<LINE>Approacheth, to confer about some matter.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is all our travail turn&#8217;d to this effect?</LINE>
<LINE>After the slaughter of so many peers,</LINE>
<LINE>So many captains, gentlemen, and soldiers,</LINE>
<LINE>That in this quarrel have been overthrown</LINE>
<LINE>And sold their bodies for their country&#8217;s benefit,</LINE>
<LINE>Shall we at last conclude effeminate peace?</LINE>
<LINE>Have we not lost most part of all the towns,</LINE>
<LINE>By treason, falsehood, and by treachery,</LINE>
<LINE>Our great progenitors had conquered?</LINE>
<LINE>O Warwick, Warwick, I foresee with grief</LINE>
<LINE>The utter loss of all the realm of France.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Be patient, York. If we conclude a peace,</LINE>
<LINE>It shall be with such strict and severe covenants,</LINE>
<LINE>As little shall the Frenchmen gain thereby.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Charles, Alanson, Bastard, Reignier, and others.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Since, lords of England, it is thus agreed</LINE>
<LINE>That peaceful truce shall be proclaim&#8217;d in France,</LINE>
<LINE>We come to be informed by yourselves</LINE>
<LINE>What the conditions of that league must be.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Speak, Winchester, for boiling choler chokes</LINE>
<LINE>The hollow passage of my poison&#8217;d voice,</LINE>
<LINE>By sight of these our baleful enemies.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Charles, and the rest, it is enacted thus:</LINE>
<LINE>That, in regard King Henry gives consent,</LINE>
<LINE>Of mere compassion and of lenity,</LINE>
<LINE>To ease your country of distressful war</LINE>
<LINE>And suffer you to breathe in fruitful peace,</LINE>
<LINE>You shall become true liegemen to his crown.</LINE>
<LINE>And, Charles, upon condition thou wilt swear</LINE>
<LINE>To pay him tribute and submit thyself,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou shalt be plac&#8217;d as viceroy under him,</LINE>
<LINE>And still enjoy thy regal dignity.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Must he be then as shadow of himself?</LINE>
<LINE>Adorn his temples with a coronet,</LINE>
<LINE>And yet, in substance and authority,</LINE>
<LINE>Retain but privilege of a private man?</LINE>
<LINE>This proffer is absurd and reasonless.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CHAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis known already that I am possess&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>With more than half the Gallian territories,</LINE>
<LINE>And therein reverenc&#8217;d for their lawful king.</LINE>
<LINE>Shall I, for lucre of the rest unvanquish&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Detract so much from that prerogative</LINE>
<LINE>As to be call&#8217;d but viceroy of the whole?</LINE>
<LINE>No, lord ambassador, I&#8217;ll rather keep</LINE>
<LINE>That which I have than, coveting for more,</LINE>
<LINE>Be cast from possibility of all.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Insulting Charles, hast thou by secret means</LINE>
<LINE>Us&#8217;d intercession to obtain a league,</LINE>
<LINE>And, now the matter grows to compremise,</LINE>
<LINE>Stand&#8217;st thou aloof upon comparison?</LINE>
<LINE>Either accept the title thou usurp&#8217;st,</LINE>
<LINE>Of benefit proceeding from our king,</LINE>
<LINE>And not of any challenge of desert,</LINE>
<LINE>Or we will plague thee with incessant wars.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Aside to Charles.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>My lord, you do not well in obstinacy</LINE>

<LINE>If once it be neglected, ten to one</LINE>
<LINE>We shall not find like opportunity.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALAN.</SPEAKER>
<STAGEDIR>Aside to Charles.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>To say the truth, it is your policy</LINE>
<LINE>To save your subjects from such massacre</LINE>
<LINE>And ruthless slaughters as are daily seen</LINE>
<LINE>By our proceeding in hostility,</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore take this compact of a truce,</LINE>
<LINE>Although you break it when your pleasure serves.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How say&#8217;st thou, Charles? Shall our condition stand?</LINE>

<LINE>Only reserv&#8217;d, you claim no interest</LINE>
<LINE>In any of our towns of garrison.</LINE>

<LINE>Then swear allegiance to his Majesty,</LINE>
<LINE>As thou art knight, never to disobey</LINE>
<LINE>Nor be rebellious to the crown of England.</LINE>
<LINE>Thou, nor thy nobles, to the crown of England.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Charles and his party give tokens of fealty.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>So, now dismiss your army when ye please;</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Suffolk in conference with the King, Gloucester, and Exeter.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your wondrous rare description, noble Earl,</LINE>
<LINE>Of beauteous Margaret hath astonish&#8217;d me.</LINE>
<LINE>Her virtues, graced with external gifts,</LINE>
<LINE>Do breed love&#8217;s settled passions in my heart,</LINE>
<LINE>And like as rigor of tempestuous gusts</LINE>
<LINE>Provokes the mightiest hulk against the tide,</LINE>
<LINE>So am I driven by breath of her renown,</LINE>
<LINE>Either to suffer shipwrack, or arrive</LINE>
<LINE>Where I may have fruition of her love.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tush, my good lord, this superficial tale</LINE>
<LINE>Is but a preface of her worthy praise.</LINE>
<LINE>The chief perfections of that lovely dame</LINE>
<LINE>(Had I sufficient skill to utter them)</LINE>
<LINE>Would make a volume of enticing lines,</LINE>
<LINE>Able to ravish any dull conceit;</LINE>
<LINE>And, which is more, she is not so divine,</LINE>
<LINE>So full replete with choice of all delights,</LINE>
<LINE>But with as humble lowliness of mind</LINE>
<LINE>She is content to be at your command&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Command, I mean, of virtuous chaste intents,</LINE>
<LINE>To love and honor Henry as her lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And otherwise will Henry ne&#8217;er presume.</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore, my Lord Protector, give consent</LINE>
<LINE>That Marg&#8217;ret may be England&#8217;s royal queen.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So should I give consent to flatter sin.</LINE>
<LINE>You know, my lord, your Highness is betroth&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>Unto another lady of esteem.</LINE>
<LINE>How shall we then dispense with that contract,</LINE>
<LINE>And not deface your honor with reproach?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As doth a ruler with unlawful oaths,</LINE>
<LINE>Or one that at a triumph, having vow&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>To try his strength, forsaketh yet the lists</LINE>
<LINE>By reason of his adversary&#8217;s odds.</LINE>
<LINE>A poor earl&#8217;s daughter is unequal odds,</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore may be broke without offense.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, what, I pray, is Margaret more than that?</LINE>
<LINE>Her father is no better than an earl,</LINE>
<LINE>Although in glorious titles he excel.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, my lord, her father is a king,</LINE>
<LINE>The King of Naples and Jerusalem,</LINE>
<LINE>And of such great authority in France</LINE>
<LINE>As his alliance will confirm our peace,</LINE>
<LINE>And keep the Frenchmen in allegiance.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And so the Earl of Armagnac may do,</LINE>
<LINE>Because he is near kinsman unto Charles.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EXE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Beside, his wealth doth warrant a liberal dower,</LINE>
<LINE>Where Reignier sooner will receive than give.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A dow&#8217;r, my lords? Disgrace not so your king,</LINE>
<LINE>That he should be so abject, base, and poor,</LINE>
<LINE>To choose for wealth and not for perfect love.</LINE>
<LINE>Henry is able to enrich his queen,</LINE>
<LINE>And not to seek a queen to make him rich:</LINE>
<LINE>So worthless peasants bargain for their wives,</LINE>
<LINE>As market men for oxen, sheep, or horse.</LINE>
<LINE>Marriage is a matter of more worth</LINE>
<LINE>Than to be dealt in by attorneyship.</LINE>
<LINE>Not whom we will, but whom his Grace affects,</LINE>
<LINE>Must be companion of his nuptial bed.</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore, lords, since he affects her most,</LINE>
<LINE>Most of all these reasons bindeth us</LINE>
<LINE>In our opinions she should be preferr&#8217;d.</LINE>
<LINE>For what is wedlock forced, but a hell,</LINE>
<LINE>An age of discord and continual strife?</LINE>
<LINE>Whereas the contrary bringeth bliss,</LINE>
<LINE>And is a pattern of celestial peace.</LINE>
<LINE>Whom should we match with Henry, being a king,</LINE>
<LINE>But Margaret, that is daughter to a king?</LINE>
<LINE>Her peerless feature, joined with her birth,</LINE>
<LINE>Approves her fit for none but for a king.</LINE>
<LINE>Her valiant courage and undaunted spirit</LINE>
<LINE>(More than in women commonly is seen)</LINE>
<LINE>Will answer our hope in issue of a king;</LINE>
<LINE>For Henry, son unto a conqueror,</LINE>
<LINE>Is likely to beget more conquerors,</LINE>
<LINE>If with a lady of so high resolve</LINE>
<LINE>(As is fair Margaret) he be link&#8217;d in love.</LINE>
<LINE>Then yield, my lords, and here conclude with me</LINE>
<LINE>That Margaret shall be Queen, and none but she.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Whether it be through force of your report,</LINE>
<LINE>My noble Lord of Suffolk, or for that</LINE>
<LINE>My tender youth was never yet attaint</LINE>
<LINE>With any passion of inflaming love,</LINE>
<LINE>I cannot tell; but this I am assur&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>I feel such sharp dissension in my breast,</LINE>
<LINE>Such fierce alarums both of hope and fear,</LINE>
<LINE>As I am sick with working of my thoughts.</LINE>
<LINE>Take therefore shipping, post, my lord, to France,</LINE>
<LINE>Agree to any covenants, and procure</LINE>
<LINE>That Lady Margaret do vouchsafe to come</LINE>
<LINE>To cross the seas to England and be crown&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>King Henry&#8217;s faithful and anointed queen.</LINE>
<LINE>For your expenses and sufficient charge,</LINE>
<LINE>Among the people gather up a tenth.</LINE>
<LINE>Be gone, I say, for till you do return,</LINE>
<LINE>I rest perplexed with a thousand cares.</LINE>
<LINE>And you, good uncle, banish all offense.</LINE>
<LINE>If you do censure me by what you were,</LINE>
<LINE>Not what you are, I know it will excuse</LINE>
<LINE>This sudden execution of my will.</LINE>
<LINE>And so conduct me where, from company,</LINE>
<LINE>I may revolve and ruminate my grief.</LINE>

<LINE>But I will rule both her, the King, and realm.</LINE>
