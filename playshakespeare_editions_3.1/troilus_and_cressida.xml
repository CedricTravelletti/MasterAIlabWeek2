<SPEAKER>THE PROLOGUE</SPEAKER>
<LINE> In Troy, there lies the scene. From isles of Greece</LINE>
<LINE>The princes orgulous, their high blood chaf&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Have to the port of Athens sent their ships</LINE>
<LINE>Fraught with the ministers and instruments</LINE>
<LINE>Of cruel war. Sixty and nine, that wore</LINE>
<LINE>Their crownets regal, from th&#8217; Athenian bay</LINE>
<LINE>Put forth toward Phrygia, and their vow is made</LINE>
<LINE>To ransack Troy, within whose strong immures</LINE>
<LINE>The ravish&#8217;d Helen, Menelaus&#8217; queen,</LINE>
<LINE>With wanton Paris sleeps&#8212;and that&#8217;s the quarrel.</LINE>
<LINE>To Tenedos they come,</LINE>
<LINE>And the deep-drawing barks do there disgorge</LINE>
<LINE>Their warlike fraughtage. Now on Dardan plains</LINE>
<LINE>The fresh and yet unbruised Greeks do pitch</LINE>
<LINE>Their brave pavilions. Priam&#8217;s six-gated city,</LINE>
<LINE>Dardan and Timbria, Helias, Chetas, Troien,</LINE>
<LINE>And Antenorides, with massy staples</LINE>
<LINE>And corresponsive and fulfilling bolts</LINE>
<LINE>Sperr up the sons of Troy.</LINE>
<LINE>Now expectation, tickling skittish spirits,</LINE>
<LINE>On one and other side, Troyan and Greek,</LINE>
<LINE>Sets all on hazard&#8212;and hither am I come,</LINE>
<LINE>A prologue arm&#8217;d, but not in confidence</LINE>
<LINE>Of author&#8217;s pen or actor&#8217;s voice, but suited</LINE>
<LINE>In like conditions as our argument,</LINE>
<LINE>To tell you, fair beholders, that our play</LINE>
<LINE>Leaps o&#8217;er the vaunt and firstlings of those broils,</LINE>
<LINE>Beginning in the middle; starting thence away</LINE>
<LINE>To what may be digested in a play.</LINE>
<LINE>Like or find fault, do as your pleasures are,</LINE>
<LINE>Now good or bad, &#8217;tis but the chance of war.</LINE>

<SCENELOCATION>Troy. Before Priam&#8217;s palace.</SCENELOCATION>
<SCENEPERSONAE>(Pandarus, Troilus, Aeneas)</SCENEPERSONAE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Pandarus and Troilus.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Call here my varlet, I&#8217;ll unarm again.</LINE>
<LINE>Why should I war without the walls of Troy,</LINE>
<LINE>That find such cruel battle here within?</LINE>
<LINE>Each Troyan that is master of his heart,</LINE>
<LINE>Let him to field, Troilus, alas, hath none.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Will this gear ne&#8217;er be mended?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The Greeks are strong, and skillful to their strength,</LINE>
<LINE>Fierce to their skill, and to their fierceness valiant,</LINE>
<LINE>But I am weaker than a woman&#8217;s tear,</LINE>
<LINE>Tamer than sleep, fonder than ignorance,</LINE>
<LINE>Less valiant than the virgin in the night,</LINE>
<LINE>And skilless as unpractic&#8217;d infancy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, I have told you enough of this. For my part, I&#8217;ll not meddle nor make no farther. He that will have a cake out of the wheat must tarry the grinding.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Have I not tarried?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, the grinding; but you must tarry the bolting.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Have I not tarried?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, the bolting; but you must tarry the leavening.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Still have I tarried.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, to the leavening, but here&#8217;s yet in the word &#8220;hereafter&#8221; the kneading, the making of the cake, the heating the oven, and the baking; nay, you must stay the cooling too, or ye may chance burn your lips.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Patience herself, what goddess e&#8217;er she be,</LINE>
<LINE>Doth lesser blench at suff&#8217;rance than I do.</LINE>
<LINE>At Priam&#8217;s royal table do I sit,</LINE>
<LINE>And when fair Cressid comes into my thoughts&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>So, traitor, then she comes when she is thence.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, she look&#8217;d yesternight fairer than ever</LINE>
<LINE>I saw her look, or any woman else.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I was about to tell thee&#8212;when my heart,</LINE>
<LINE>As wedged with a sigh, would rive in twain,</LINE>
<LINE>Lest Hector or my father should perceive me,</LINE>
<LINE>I have (as when the sun doth light a-scorn)</LINE>
<LINE>Buried this sigh in wrinkle of a smile,</LINE>
<LINE>But sorrow that is couch&#8217;d in seeming gladness</LINE>
<LINE>Is like that mirth fate turns to sudden sadness.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And her hair were not somewhat darker than Helen&#8217;s&#8212;well, go to!&#8212;there were no more comparison between the women! But for my part, she is my kinswoman; I would not, as they term it, praise her, but I would somebody had heard her talk yesterday as I did. I will not dispraise your sister Cassandra&#8217;s wit, but&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O Pandarus! I tell thee, Pandarus&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>When I do tell thee there my hopes lie drown&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Reply not in how many fathoms deep</LINE>
<LINE>They lie indrench&#8217;d. I tell thee I am mad</LINE>
<LINE>In Cressid&#8217;s love; thou answer&#8217;st she is fair,</LINE>
<LINE>Pourest in the open ulcer of my heart</LINE>
<LINE>Her eyes, her hair, her cheek, her gait, her voice,</LINE>
<LINE>Handiest in thy discourse, O, that her hand,</LINE>
<LINE>In whose comparison all whites are ink</LINE>
<LINE>Writing their own reproach; to whose soft seizure</LINE>
<LINE>The cygnet&#8217;s down is harsh, and spirit of sense</LINE>
<LINE>Hard as the palm of ploughman. This thou tell&#8217;st me,</LINE>
<LINE>As true thou tell&#8217;st me, when I say I love her,</LINE>
<LINE>But saying thus, in stead of oil and balm,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou lay&#8217;st in every gash that love hath given me</LINE>
<LINE>The knife that made it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I speak no more than truth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou dost not speak so much.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Faith, I&#8217;ll not meddle in it, let her be as she is; if she be fair, &#8217;tis the better for her; and she be not, she has the mends in her own hands.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good Pandarus! How now, Pandarus?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have had my labor for my travail; ill thought on of her, and ill thought on of you; gone between and between, but small thanks for my labor.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, art thou angry, Pandarus? What, with me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Because she&#8217;s kin to me, therefore she&#8217;s not so fair as Helen. And she were not kin to me, she would be as fair a&#8217; Friday as Helen is on Sunday. But what care I? I care not and she were a blackamoor, &#8217;tis all one to me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Say I she is not fair?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do not care whether you do or no. She&#8217;s a fool to stay behind her father, let her to the Greeks; and so I&#8217;ll tell her the next time I see her. For my part, I&#8217;ll meddle nor make no more i&#8217; th&#8217; matter.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pandarus&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not I.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sweet Pandarus&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pray you speak no more to me, I will leave all as I found it, and there an end.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit. Sound alarum.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Peace, you ungracious clamors! Peace, rude sounds!</LINE>
<LINE>Fools on both sides, Helen must needs be fair,</LINE>
<LINE>When with your blood you daily paint her thus.</LINE>
<LINE>I cannot fight upon this argument;</LINE>
<LINE>It is too starv&#8217;d a subject for my sword.</LINE>
<LINE>But Pandarus&#8212;O gods! How do you plague me!</LINE>
<LINE>I cannot come to Cressid but by Pandar,</LINE>
<LINE>And he&#8217;s as teachy to be woo&#8217;d to woo,</LINE>
<LINE>As she is stubborn-chaste against all suit.</LINE>
<LINE>Tell me, Apollo, for thy Daphne&#8217;s love,</LINE>
<LINE>What Cressid is, what Pandar, and what we:</LINE>
<LINE>Her bed is India, there she lies, a pearl;</LINE>
<LINE>Between our Ilium and where she resides,</LINE>
<LINE>Let it be call&#8217;d the wild and wand&#8217;ring flood,</LINE>
<LINE>Ourself the merchant, and this sailing Pandar</LINE>
<LINE>Our doubtful hope, our convoy, and our bark.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Alarum. Enter Aeneas.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How now, Prince Troilus, wherefore not a-field?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Because not there. This woman&#8217;s answer sorts,</LINE>
<LINE>For womanish it is to be from thence.</LINE>
<LINE>What news, Aeneas, from the field today?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That Paris is returned home and hurt.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEAKER>AENE.</SPEAKER>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Let Paris bleed, &#8217;tis but a scar to scorn;</LINE>
<LINE>Paris is gor&#8217;d with Menelaus&#8217; horn.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hark what good sport is out of town today.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Better at home, if &#8220;would I might&#8221; were &#8220;may.&#8221;</LINE>
<LINE>But to the sport abroad&#8212;are you bound thither?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>In all swift haste.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Cressid and her man Alexander.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CRES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who were those went by?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALEX.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Queen Hecuba and Helen.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CRES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And whither go they?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALEX.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Up to the eastern tower,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose height commands as subject all the vale,</LINE>
<LINE>To see the battle. Hector, whose patience</LINE>
<LINE>Is as a virtue fix&#8217;d, today was mov&#8217;d:</LINE>
<LINE>He chid Andromache and strook his armorer,</LINE>
<LINE>And like as there were husbandry in war,</LINE>
<LINE>Before the sun rose he was harness&#8217;d light,</LINE>
<LINE>And to the field goes he; where every flower</LINE>
<LINE>Did as a prophet weep what it foresaw</LINE>
<LINE>In Hector&#8217;s wrath.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CRES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">What was his cause of anger?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALEX.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The noise goes, this: there is among the Greeks</LINE>
<LINE>A lord of Troyan blood, nephew to Hector,</LINE>
<LINE>They call him Ajax.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CRES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Good; and what of him?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALEX.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>They say he is a very man per se and stands alone.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CRES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So do all men, unless th&#8217; are drunk, sick, or have no legs.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALEX.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This man, lady, hath robb&#8217;d many beasts of their particular additions: he is as valiant as the lion, churlish as the bear, slow as the elephant; a man into whom nature hath so crowded humors that his valor is crush&#8217;d into folly, his folly sauc&#8217;d with discretion. There is no man hath a virtue that he hath not a glimpse of, nor any man an attaint but he carries some stain of it. He is melancholy without cause, and merry against the hair; he hath the joints of every thing, but every thing so out of joint that he is a gouty Briareus, many hands and no use, or purblind Argus, all eyes and no sight.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CRES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But how should this man, that makes me smile, make Hector angry?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALEX.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>They say he yesterday cop&#8217;d Hector in the battle and strook him down, the disdain and shame whereof hath ever since kept Hector fasting and waking.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Pandarus.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CRES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who comes here?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALEX.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Madam, your uncle Pandarus.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CRES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hector&#8217;s a gallant man.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALEX.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As may be in the world, lady.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What&#8217;s that? What&#8217;s that?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CRES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good morrow, uncle Pandarus.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good morrow, cousin Cressid. What do you talk of? Good morrow, Alexander. How do you, cousin? When were you at Ilium?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CRES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This morning, uncle.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What were you talking of when I came? Was Hector arm&#8217;d and gone ere ye came to Ilium? Helen was not up, was she?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CRES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hector was gone, but Helen was not up.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>E&#8217;en so; Hector was stirring early.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CRES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That were we talking of, and of his anger.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Was he angry?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CRES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So he says here.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>True, he was so; I know the cause too. He&#8217;ll lay about him today, I can tell them that, and there&#8217;s Troilus will not come far behind him. Let them take heed of Troilus; I can tell them that too.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CRES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, is he angry too?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who, Troilus? Troilus is the better man of the two.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CRES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O Jupiter, there&#8217;s no comparison.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, not between Troilus and Hector? Do you know a man if you see him?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CRES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, if I ever saw him before and knew him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, I say Troilus is Troilus.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CRES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then you say as I say, for I am sure he is not Hector.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, nor Hector is not Troilus in some degrees.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CRES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis just to each of them; he is himself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Himself? Alas, poor Troilus, I would he were!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CRES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So he is.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Condition I had gone barefoot to India.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CRES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He is not Hector.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Himself? No! He&#8217;s not himself. Would &#8217;a were himself! Well, the gods are above, time must friend or end. Well, Troilus, well, I would my heart were in her body. No, Hector is not a better man than Troilus.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CRES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Excuse me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He is elder.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CRES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pardon me, pardon me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Th&#8217; other&#8217;s not come to&#8217;t. You shall tell me another tale when th&#8217; other&#8217;s come to&#8217;t. Hector shall not have his wit this year.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CRES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He shall not need it if he have his own.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nor his qualities.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CRES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No matter.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nor his beauty.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CRES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;Twould not become him, his own&#8217;s better.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You have no judgment, niece. Helen herself swore th&#8217; other day that Troilus, for a brown favor (for so &#8217;tis, I must confess)&#8212;not brown neither&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CRES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, but brown.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Faith, to say truth, brown and not brown.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CRES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To say the truth, true and not true.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She prais&#8217;d his complexion above Paris.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CRES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, Paris hath color enough.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So he has.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CRES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then Troilus should have too much: if she prais&#8217;d him above, his complexion is higher than his. He having color enough, and the other higher, is too flaming a praise for a good complexion. I had as lieve Helen&#8217;s golden tongue had commended Troilus for a copper nose.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I swear to you, I think Helen loves him better than Paris.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CRES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then she&#8217;s a merry Greek indeed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, I am sure she does. She came to him th&#8217; other day into the compass&#8217;d window&#8212;and you know he has not past three or four hairs on his chin&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>But more in Troilus thousandfold I see</LINE>
<LINE>Than in the glass of Pandar&#8217;s praise may be;</LINE>
<LINE>Yet hold I off. Women are angels, wooing:</LINE>
<LINE>Things won are done, joy&#8217;s soul lies in the doing.</LINE>
<LINE>That she belov&#8217;d knows nought that knows not this:</LINE>
<LINE>Men prize the thing ungain&#8217;d more than it is.</LINE>
<LINE>That she was never yet that ever knew</LINE>
<LINE>Love got so sweet as when desire did sue.</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore this maxim out of love I teach:</LINE>

<LINE>Bias and thwart, not answering the aim</LINE>
<LINE>And that unbodied figure of the thought</LINE>

<LINE>And call them shames which are indeed nought else</LINE>
<LINE>But the protractive trials of great Jove</LINE>

<LINE>Troy, yet upon his bases, had been down,</LINE>
<LINE>And the great Hector&#8217;s sword had lack&#8217;d a master,</LINE>
<LINE>But for these instances:</LINE>
<LINE>The specialty of rule hath been neglected,</LINE>
<LINE>And look how many Grecian tents do stand</LINE>
<LINE>Hollow upon this plain, so many hollow factions.</LINE>
<LINE>When that the general is not like the hive</LINE>
<LINE>To whom the foragers shall all repair,</LINE>
<LINE>What honey is expected? Degree being vizarded,</LINE>
<LINE>Th&#8217; unworthiest shows as fairly in the mask.</LINE>
<LINE>The heavens themselves, the planets, and this centre</LINE>
<LINE>Observe degree, priority, and place,</LINE>
<LINE>Insisture, course, proportion, season, form,</LINE>
<LINE>Office, and custom, in all line of order;</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore is the glorious planet Sol</LINE>
<LINE>In noble eminence enthron&#8217;d and spher&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>Amidst the other; whose med&#8217;cinable eye</LINE>
<LINE>Corrects the ill aspects of planets evil,</LINE>
<LINE>And posts like the commandment of a king,</LINE>
<LINE>Sans check, to good and bad. But when the planets</LINE>
<LINE>In evil mixture to disorder wander,</LINE>
<LINE>What plagues and what portents, what mutiny!</LINE>
<LINE>What raging of the sea, shaking of earth!</LINE>
<LINE>Commotion in the winds!, frights, changes, horrors</LINE>
<LINE>Divert and crack, rend and deracinate</LINE>
<LINE>The unity and married calm of states</LINE>
<LINE>Quite from their fixure! O, when degree is shak&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Which is the ladder of all high designs,</LINE>
<LINE>The enterprise is sick. How could communities,</LINE>
<LINE>Degrees in schools, and brotherhoods in cities,</LINE>
<LINE>Peaceful commerce from dividable shores,</LINE>
<LINE>The primogenity and due of birth,</LINE>
<LINE>Prerogative of age, crowns, sceptres, laurels,</LINE>
<LINE>But by degree stand in authentic place?</LINE>
<LINE>Take but degree away, untune that string,</LINE>
<LINE>And hark what discord follows. Each thing meets</LINE>
<LINE>In mere oppugnancy: the bounded waters</LINE>
<LINE>Should lift their bosoms higher than the shores,</LINE>
<LINE>And make a sop of all this solid globe;</LINE>
<LINE>Strength should be lord of imbecility,</LINE>
<LINE>And the rude son should strike his father dead;</LINE>
<LINE>Force should be right, or rather, right and wrong</LINE>
<LINE>(Between whose endless jar justice resides)</LINE>
<LINE>Should lose their names, and so should justice too!</LINE>
<LINE>Then every thing include itself in power,</LINE>
<LINE>Power into will, will into appetite,</LINE>
<LINE>And appetite, an universal wolf</LINE>

<LINE>The sinow and the forehand of our host,</LINE>
<LINE>Having his ear full of his airy fame,</LINE>
<LINE>Grows dainty of his worth, and in his tent</LINE>
<LINE>Lies mocking our designs. With him Patroclus</LINE>
<LINE>Upon a lazy bed the livelong day</LINE>
<LINE>Breaks scurril jests,</LINE>
<LINE>And with ridiculous and awkward action,</LINE>
<LINE>Which, slanderer, he imitation calls,</LINE>
<LINE>He pageants us. Sometime, great Agamemnon,</LINE>
<LINE>Thy topless deputation he puts on,</LINE>
<LINE>And like a strutting player, whose conceit</LINE>
<LINE>Lies in his hamstring, and doth think it rich</LINE>
<LINE>To hear the wooden dialogue and sound</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Twixt his stretch&#8217;d footing and the scaffoldage,</LINE>
<LINE>Such to-be-pitied and o&#8217;er-wrested seeming</LINE>
<LINE>He acts thy greatness in; and when he speaks,</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis like a chime a-mending, with terms unsquar&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Which from the tongue of roaring Typhon dropp&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>Would seem hyperboles. At this fusty stuff</LINE>
<LINE>The large Achilles, on his press&#8217;d bed lolling,</LINE>
<LINE>From his deep chest laughs out a loud applause,</LINE>
<LINE>Cries, &#8220;Excellent! &#8217;tis Agamemnon right!</LINE>
<LINE>Now play me Nestor, hem, and stroke thy beard,</LINE>
<LINE>As he being dress&#8217;d to some oration.&#8221;</LINE>
<LINE>That&#8217;s done, as near as the extremest ends</LINE>
<LINE>Of parallels, as like as Vulcan and his wife;</LINE>
<LINE>Yet god Achilles still cries, &#8220;Excellent!</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis Nestor right. Now play him me, Patroclus,</LINE>
<LINE>Arming to answer in a night alarm.&#8221;</LINE>
<LINE>And then forsooth the faint defects of age</LINE>
<LINE>Must be the scene of mirth; to cough and spit,</LINE>
<LINE>And with a palsy fumbling on his gorget,</LINE>
<LINE>Shake in and out the rivet; and at this sport</LINE>
<LINE>Sir Valor dies; cries, &#8220;O, enough, Patroclus,</LINE>
<LINE>Or give me ribs of steel! I shall split all</LINE>
<LINE>In pleasure of my spleen.&#8221; And in this fashion,</LINE>
<LINE>All our abilities, gifts, natures, shapes,</LINE>
<LINE>Severals and generals of grace exact,</LINE>
<LINE>Achievements, plots, orders, preventions,</LINE>
<LINE>Excitements to the field, or speech for truce,</LINE>
<LINE>Success or loss, what is or is not, serves</LINE>
<LINE>As stuff for these two to make paradoxes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NEST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And in the imitation of these twain&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Who, as Ulysses says, opinion crowns</LINE>
<LINE>With an imperial voice&#8212;many are infect.</LINE>
<LINE>Ajax is grown self-will&#8217;d, and bears his head</LINE>
<LINE>In such a rein, in full as proud a place</LINE>
<LINE>As broad Achilles; keeps his tent like him,</LINE>
<LINE>Makes factious feasts, rails on our state of war,</LINE>
<LINE>Bold as an oracle, and sets Thersites,</LINE>
<LINE>A slave whose gall coins slanders like a mint,</LINE>
<LINE>To match us in comparisons with dirt,</LINE>
<LINE>To weaken or discredit our exposure,</LINE>
<LINE>How rank soever rounded in with danger.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ULYSS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>They tax our policy, and call it cowardice,</LINE>
<LINE>Count wisdom as no member of the war,</LINE>
<LINE>Forestall prescience, and esteem no act</LINE>
<LINE>But that of hand. The still and mental parts,</LINE>
<LINE>That do contrive how many hands shall strike</LINE>
<LINE>When fitness calls them on, and know by measure</LINE>
<LINE>Of their observant toil the enemies&#8217; weight&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Why, this hath not a finger&#8217;s dignity.</LINE>
<LINE>They call this bed-work, mapp&#8217;ry, closet-war,</LINE>
<LINE>So that the ram that batters down the wall,</LINE>
<LINE>For the great swinge and rudeness of his poise,</LINE>
<LINE>They place before his hand that made the engine,</LINE>
<LINE>Or those that with the fineness of their souls</LINE>
<LINE>By reason guide his execution.</LINE>

<LINE offset="8">How?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay,</LINE>
<LINE>I ask, that I might waken reverence,</LINE>
<LINE>And bid the cheek be ready with a blush</LINE>
<LINE>Modest as morning when she coldly eyes</LINE>
<LINE>The youthful Phoebus.</LINE>
<LINE>Which is that god in office, guiding men?</LINE>
<LINE>Which is the high and mighty Agamemnon?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AGAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This Troyan scorns us, or the men of Troy</LINE>
<LINE>Are ceremonious courtiers.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Courtiers as free, as debonair, unarm&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>As bending angels; that&#8217;s their fame in peace.</LINE>
<LINE>But when they would seem soldiers, they have galls,</LINE>
<LINE>Good arms, strong joints, true swords, and, great Jove&#8217;s accord,</LINE>
<LINE>Nothing so full of heart. But peace, Aeneas,</LINE>
<LINE>Peace, Troyan, lay thy finger on thy lips!</LINE>
<LINE>The worthiness of praise distains his worth,</LINE>
<LINE>If that the prais&#8217;d himself bring the praise forth;</LINE>
<LINE>But what the repining enemy commends,</LINE>
<LINE>That breath fame blows, that praise, sole pure, transcends.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AGAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, you of Troy, call you yourself Aeneas?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, Greek, that is my name.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>He hears nought privately that comes from Troy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nor I from Troy come not to whisper with him.</LINE>
<LINE>I bring a trumpet to awake his ear,</LINE>
<LINE>To set his sense on the attentive bent,</LINE>
<LINE>And then to speak.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AGAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Speak frankly as the wind,</LINE>
<LINE>It is not Agamemnon&#8217;s sleeping hour.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Sound trumpet.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>We have, great Agamemnon, here in Troy</LINE>
<LINE>A prince call&#8217;d Hector&#8212;Priam is his father&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Who in this dull and long-continued truce</LINE>
<LINE>Is resty grown. He bade me take a trumpet,</LINE>
<LINE>And to this purpose speak: kings, princes, lords!</LINE>
<LINE>If there be one among the fair&#8217;st of Greece</LINE>
<LINE>That holds his honor higher than his ease,</LINE>
<LINE>And seeks his praise more than he fears his peril,</LINE>
<LINE>That knows his valor, and knows not his fear,</LINE>
<LINE>That loves his mistress more than in confession</LINE>
<LINE>With truant vows to her own lips he loves,</LINE>
<LINE>And dare avow her beauty and her worth</LINE>
<LINE>In other arms than hers&#8212;to him this challenge!</LINE>
<LINE>Hector, in view of Troyans and of Greeks,</LINE>
<LINE>Shall make it good, or do his best to do it:</LINE>
<LINE>He hath a lady, wiser, fairer, truer,</LINE>
<LINE>Than ever Greek did couple in his arms,</LINE>
<LINE>And will tomorrow with his trumpet call,</LINE>
<LINE>Midway between your tents and walls of Troy,</LINE>
<LINE>To rouse a Grecian that is true in love.</LINE>
<LINE>If any come, Hector shall honor him;</LINE>
<LINE>If none, he&#8217;ll say in Troy when he retires,</LINE>
<LINE>The Grecian dames are sunburnt, and not worth</LINE>
<LINE>The splinter of a lance. Even so much.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AGAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This shall be told our lovers, Lord Aeneas.</LINE>
<LINE>If none of them have soul in such a kind,</LINE>
<LINE>We left them all at home. But we are soldiers,</LINE>
<LINE>And may that soldier a mere recreant prove,</LINE>
<LINE>That means not, hath not, or is not in love!</LINE>
<LINE>If then one is, or hath, or means to be,</LINE>
<LINE>That one meets Hector; if none else, I am he.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NEST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tell him of Nestor, one that was a man</LINE>
<LINE>When Hector&#8217;s grandsire suck&#8217;d. He is old now,</LINE>
<LINE>But if there be not in our Grecian mould</LINE>
<LINE>A noble man that hath no spark of fire</LINE>
<LINE>To answer for his love, tell him from me</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll hide my silver beard in a gold beaver,</LINE>
<LINE>And in my vambrace put my withered brawns,</LINE>
<LINE>And meeting him will tell him that my lady</LINE>
<LINE>Was fairer than his grandam, and as chaste</LINE>
<LINE>As may be in the world. His youth in flood,</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll prove this troth with my three drops of blood.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Fair Lord Aeneas, let me touch your hand;</LINE>
<LINE>To our pavilion shall I lead you, sir,</LINE>
<LINE>Achilles shall have word of this intent,</LINE>
<LINE>So shall each lord of Greece, from tent to tent.</LINE>
<LINE>Yourself shall feast with us before you go,</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt. Manent Ulysses and Nestor.</STAGEDIR>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NEST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What says Ulysses?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ULYSS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have a young conception in my brain,</LINE>
<LINE>Be you my time to bring it to some shape.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NEST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What is&#8217;t?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ULYSS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This &#8217;tis:</LINE>
<LINE>Blunt wedges rive hard knots; the seeded pride</LINE>
<LINE>That hath to this maturity blown up</LINE>
<LINE>In rank Achilles must or now be cropp&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Or shedding, breed a nursery of like evil,</LINE>
<LINE>To overbulk us all.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NEST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Well, and how?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ULYSS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This challenge that the gallant Hector sends,</LINE>
<LINE>However it is spread in general name,</LINE>
<LINE>Relates in purpose only to Achilles.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NEST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>True, the purpose is perspicuous as substance,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose grossness little characters sum up;</LINE>
<LINE>And in the publication make no strain</LINE>
<LINE>But that Achilles, were his brain as barren</LINE>
<LINE>As banks of Libya (though, Apollo knows,</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis dry enough), will with great speed of judgment,</LINE>
<LINE>Ay, with celerity, find Hector&#8217;s purpose</LINE>
<LINE>Pointing on him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ULYSS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And wake him to the answer, think you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NEST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, &#8217;tis most meet; who may you else oppose</LINE>
<LINE>That can from Hector bring those honors off,</LINE>
<LINE>If not Achilles? Though&#8217;t be a sportful combat,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet in the trial much opinion dwells;</LINE>
<LINE>For here the Troyans taste our dear&#8217;st repute</LINE>
<LINE>With their fin&#8217;st palate; and trust to me, Ulysses,</LINE>
<LINE>Our imputation shall be oddly pois&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>In this vild action, for the success,</LINE>
<LINE>Although particular, shall give a scantling</LINE>
<LINE>Of good or bad unto the general,</LINE>
<LINE>And in such indexes (although small pricks</LINE>
<LINE>To their subsequent volumes) there is seen</LINE>
<LINE>The baby figure of the giant mass</LINE>
<LINE>Of things to come at large. It is suppos&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>He that meets Hector issues from our choice,</LINE>
<LINE>And choice (being mutual act of all our souls)</LINE>
<LINE>Makes merit her election, and doth boil</LINE>
<LINE>(As &#8217;twere from forth us all) a man distill&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>Out of our virtues, who miscarrying,</LINE>
<LINE>What heart receives from hence a conquering part</LINE>
<LINE>To steel a strong opinion to themselves?</LINE>
<LINE>Which entertain&#8217;d, limbs are his instruments,</LINE>
<LINE>In no less working than are swords and bows</LINE>
<LINE>Directive by the limbs.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ULYSS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Give pardon to my speech:</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore &#8217;tis meet Achilles meet not Hector.</LINE>
<LINE>Let us like merchants first show foul wares,</LINE>
<LINE>And think perchance they&#8217;ll sell; if not,</LINE>
<LINE>The lustre of the better shall exceed</LINE>
<LINE>By showing the worse first. Do not consent</LINE>
<LINE>That ever Hector and Achilles meet,</LINE>
<LINE>For both our honor and our shame in this</LINE>
<LINE>Are dogg&#8217;d with two strange followers.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NEST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I see them not with my old eyes, what are they?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ULYSS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What glory our Achilles shares from Hector,</LINE>
<LINE>Were he not proud, we all should share with him.</LINE>
<LINE>But he already is too insolent;</LINE>
<LINE>And it were better parch in Afric sun</LINE>
<LINE>Than in the pride and salt scorn of his eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>Should he scape Hector fair. If he were foil&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Why then we do our main opinion crush</LINE>
<LINE>In taint of our best man. No, make a lott&#8217;ry,</LINE>
<LINE>And by device let blockish Ajax draw</LINE>
<LINE>The sort to fight with Hector; among ourselves</LINE>
<LINE>Give him allowance for the better man,</LINE>
<LINE>For that will physic the great Myrmidon,</LINE>
<LINE>Who broils in loud applause, and make him fall</LINE>
<LINE>His crest that prouder than blue Iris bends.</LINE>
<LINE>If the dull brainless Ajax come safe off,</LINE>
<LINE>We&#8217;ll dress him up in voices; if he fail,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet go we under our opinion still</LINE>
<LINE>That we have better men. But hit or miss,</LINE>
<LINE>Our project&#8217;s life this shape of sense assumes:</LINE>
<LINE>Ajax employ&#8217;d plucks down Achilles&#8217; plumes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NEST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, Ulysses, I begin to relish thy advice,</LINE>
<LINE>And I will give a taste thereof forthwith</LINE>
<LINE>To Agamemnon. Go we to him straight.</LINE>
<LINE>Two curs shall tame each other; pride alone</LINE>
<LINE>Must tarre the mastiffs on, as &#8217;twere a bone.</LINE>

<LINE>You know an enemy intends you harm;</LINE>
<LINE>You know a sword employ&#8217;d is perilous,</LINE>

<LINE>Who marvels then, when Helenus beholds</LINE>

<LINE>And fly like chidden Mercury from Jove,</LINE>

<LINE>Paris should do some vengeance on the Greeks.</LINE>
<LINE>Your breath with full consent bellied his sails;</LINE>
<LINE>The seas and winds, old wranglers, took a truce,</LINE>
<LINE>And did him service; he touch&#8217;d the ports desir&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>And for an old aunt whom the Greeks held captive,</LINE>

<LINE>Disgrace to your great worths, and shame to me,</LINE>
<LINE>Now to deliver her possession up</LINE>
<LINE>On terms of base compulsion! Can it be</LINE>
<LINE>That so degenerate a strain as this</LINE>
<LINE>Should once set footing in your generous bosoms?</LINE>
<LINE>There&#8217;s not the meanest spirit on our party</LINE>

<LINE>Paris and Troilus, you have both said well,</LINE>
<LINE>And on the cause and question now in hand</LINE>
<LINE>Have gloz&#8217;d, but superficially, not much</LINE>
<LINE>Unlike young men, whom Aristotle thought</LINE>
<LINE>Unfit to hear moral philosophy.</LINE>
<LINE>The reasons you allege do more conduce</LINE>
<LINE>To the hot passion of distemp&#8217;red blood</LINE>
<LINE>Than to make up a free determination</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Twixt right and wrong; for pleasure and revenge</LINE>
<LINE>Have ears more deaf than adders to the voice</LINE>
<LINE>Of any true decision. Nature craves</LINE>
<LINE>All dues be rend&#8217;red to their owners: now,</LINE>
<LINE>What nearer debt in all humanity</LINE>
<LINE>Than wife is to the husband? If this law</LINE>
<LINE>Of nature be corrupted through affection,</LINE>
<LINE>And that great minds, of partial indulgence</LINE>
<LINE>To their benumbed wills, resist the same,</LINE>
<LINE>There is a law in each well-order&#8217;d nation</LINE>
<LINE>To curb those raging appetites that are</LINE>
<LINE>Most disobedient and refractory.</LINE>
<LINE>If Helen then be wife to Sparta&#8217;s king,</LINE>
<LINE>As it is known she is, these moral laws</LINE>
<LINE>Of nature and of nations speak aloud</LINE>
<LINE>To have her back return&#8217;d. Thus to persist</LINE>
<LINE>In doing wrong extenuates not wrong,</LINE>
<LINE>But makes it much more heavy. Hector&#8217;s opinion</LINE>
<LINE>Is this in way of truth; yet ne&#8217;er the less,</LINE>
<LINE>My spritely brethren, I propend to you</LINE>
<LINE>In resolution to keep Helen still,</LINE>

<LINE>I would not wish a drop of Troyan blood</LINE>

<LINE>She is a theme of honor and renown,</LINE>
<LINE>A spur to valiant and magnanimous deeds,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose present courage may beat down our foes,</LINE>

Then there&#8217;s Achilles, a rare enginer! If Troy be not taken till these two undermine it, the walls will stand till they fall of themselves. O thou great thunder-darter of Olympus, forget that thou art Jove, the king of gods, and, Mercury, lose all the serpentine craft of thy caduceus, if ye take not that little little less than little wit from them that they have, which short-arm&#8217;d ignorance itself knows is so abundant scarce, it will not in circumvention deliver a fly from a spider, without drawing their massy irons and cutting the web!

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here is such patchery, such juggling, and such knavery! All the argument is a whore and a cuckold, a good quarrel to draw emulous factions and bleed to death upon. Now the dry suppeago on the subject, and war and lechery confound all!</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exit.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AGAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Where is Achilles?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PATR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Within his tent, but ill dispos&#8217;d, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AGAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let it be known to him that we are here.</LINE>
<LINE>He shent our messengers, and we lay by</LINE>
<LINE>Our appertainings, visiting of him.</LINE>
<LINE>Let him be told so, lest perchance he think</LINE>
<LINE>We dare not move the question of our place,</LINE>
<LINE>Or know not what we are.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE offset="5">I shall say so to him.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ULYSS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We saw him at the opening of his tent,</LINE>
<LINE>He is not sick.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AJAX.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, lion-sick, sick of proud heart. You may call it melancholy, if you will favor the man; but by my head, &#8217;tis pride. But why, why? Let him show us a cause. A word, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Takes Agamemnon aside.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NEST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What moves Ajax thus to bay at him?</LINE>

<LINE>Who, Thersites?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ULYSS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NEST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then will Ajax lack matter, if he have lost his argument.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ULYSS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, you see he is his argument that has his argument, Achilles.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NEST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>All the better, their fraction is more our wish than their faction. But it was a strong composure a fool could disunite.</LINE>

<LINE>The amity that wisdom knits not, folly may easily untie.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Patroclus.</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>No Achilles with him.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>ULYSS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The elephant hath joints, but none for courtesy; his legs are legs for necessity, not for flexure.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PATR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Achilles bids me say he is much sorry,</LINE>
<LINE>If any thing more than your sport and pleasure</LINE>
<LINE>Did move your greatness and this noble state</LINE>
<LINE>To call upon him. He hopes it is no other</LINE>
<LINE>But for your health and your disgestion sake,</LINE>
<LINE>An after-dinner&#8217;s breath.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AGAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Hear you, Patroclus:</LINE>
<LINE>We are too well acquainted with these answers,</LINE>
<LINE>But his evasion, wing&#8217;d thus swift with scorn,</LINE>
<LINE>Cannot outfly our apprehensions.</LINE>
<LINE>Much attribute he hath, and much the reason</LINE>
<LINE>Why we ascribe it to him; yet all his virtues,</LINE>
<LINE>Not virtuously on his own part beheld,</LINE>
<LINE>Do in our eyes begin to lose their gloss,</LINE>
<LINE>Yea, like fair fruit in an unwholesome dish,</LINE>
<LINE>Are like to rot untasted. Go and tell him</LINE>
<LINE>We come to speak with him, and you shall not sin</LINE>
<LINE>If you do say we think him over-proud</LINE>
<LINE>And under-honest, in self-assumption greater</LINE>
<LINE>Than in the note of judgment; and worthier than himself</LINE>
<LINE>Here tend the savage strangeness he puts on,</LINE>
<LINE>Disguise the holy strength of their command,</LINE>
<LINE>And underwrite in an observing kind</LINE>
<LINE>His humorous predominance; yea, watch</LINE>
<LINE>His pettish lines, his ebbs, his flows, as if</LINE>
<LINE>The passage and whole carriage of this action</LINE>
<LINE>Rode on his tide. Go tell him this, and add,</LINE>
<LINE>That if he overhold his price so much,</LINE>
<LINE>We&#8217;ll none of him; but let him, like an engine</LINE>
<LINE>Not portable, lie under this report:</LINE>

<LINE>A stirring dwarf we do allowance give</LINE>

<LINE>In second voice we&#8217;ll not be satisfied,</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exit Ulysses.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AJAX.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What is he more than another?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AGAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No more than what he thinks he is.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AJAX.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is he so much? Do you not think he thinks himself a better man than I am?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AGAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No question.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AJAX.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Will you subscribe his thought, and say he is?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AGAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, noble Ajax, you are as strong, as valiant, as wise, no less noble, much more gentle, and altogether more tractable.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AJAX.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why should a man be proud? How doth pride grow? I know not what pride is.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AGAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your mind is the clearer, Ajax, and your virtues the fairer. He that is proud eats up himself. Pride is his own glass, his own trumpet, his own chronicle, and whatever praises itself but in the deed, devours the deed in the praise.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Ulysses.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AJAX.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do hate a proud man, as I do hate the engend&#8217;ring of toads.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NEST.</SPEAKER>
<STAGEDIR>Aside.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE> And yet he loves himself. Is&#8217;t not strange?</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ULYSS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Achilles will not to the field tomorrow.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AGAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What&#8217;s his excuse?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ULYSS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">He doth rely on none,</LINE>
<LINE>But carries on the stream of his dispose</LINE>
<LINE>Without observance or respect of any,</LINE>
<LINE>In will peculiar and in self-admission.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AGAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why will he not upon our fair request</LINE>
<LINE>Untent his person and share th&#8217; air with us?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ULYSS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Things small as nothing, for request&#8217;s sake only,</LINE>
<LINE>He makes important. Possess&#8217;d he is with greatness,</LINE>
<LINE>And speaks not to himself but with a pride</LINE>
<LINE>That quarrels at self-breath. Imagin&#8217;d worth</LINE>
<LINE>Holds in his blood such swoll&#8217;n and hot discourse</LINE>
<LINE>That &#8217;twixt his mental and his active parts</LINE>
<LINE>Kingdom&#8217;d Achilles in commotion rages,</LINE>
<LINE>And batters down himself. What should I say?</LINE>
<LINE>He is so plaguy proud that the death-tokens of it</LINE>
<LINE>Cry &#8220;No recovery.&#8221;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AGAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Let Ajax go to him.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>ULYSS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O Agamemnon, let it not be so!</LINE>
<LINE>We&#8217;ll consecrate the steps that Ajax makes</LINE>
<LINE>When they go from Achilles. Shall the proud lord</LINE>
<LINE>That bastes his arrogance with his own seam,</LINE>
<LINE>And never suffers matter of the world</LINE>
<LINE>Enter his thoughts, save such as doth revolve</LINE>
<LINE>And ruminate himself, shall he be worshipp&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>Of that we hold an idol more than he?</LINE>
<LINE>No! This thrice worthy and right valiant lord</LINE>
<LINE>Shall not so stale his palm, nobly acquir&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor, by my will, assubjugate his merit,</LINE>
<LINE>As amply titled as Achilles&#8217; is,</LINE>
<LINE>By going to Achilles.</LINE>
<LINE>That were to enlard his fat-already pride,</LINE>
<LINE>And add more coals to Cancer when he burns</LINE>
<LINE>With entertaining great Hyperion.</LINE>
<LINE>This lord go to him! Jupiter forbid,</LINE>

<LINE>Not for the worth that hangs upon our quarrel.</LINE>

<LINE>Let Mars divide eternity in twain,</LINE>

<LINE>Bull-bearing Milo his addition yield</LINE>
<LINE>To sinowy Ajax. I will not praise thy wisdom,</LINE>

<LINE>When that the wat&#8217;ry palates taste indeed</LINE>
<LINE>Love&#8217;s thrice-repured nectar? Death, I fear me,</LINE>
<LINE>Sounding destruction, or some joy too fine,</LINE>
<LINE>Too subtle, potent, tun&#8217;d too sharp in sweetness</LINE>
<LINE>For the capacity of my ruder powers.</LINE>

<LINE>She&#8217;s making her ready, she&#8217;ll come straight. You must be witty now: she does so blush, and fetches her wind so short, as if she were fray&#8217;d with a spirit. I&#8217;ll fetch her. It is the prettiest villain, she fetches her breath as short as a new-ta&#8217;en sparrow.</LINE>

Why do you not speak to her? Come, draw this curtain, and let&#8217;s see your picture. Alas the day, how loath you are to offend daylight! And &#8217;twere dark you&#8217;d close sooner. So, so, rub on and kiss the mistress. How now, a kiss in fee-farm? Build there, carpenter, the air is sweet. Nay, you shall fight your hearts out ere I part you&#8212;the falcon as the tercel, for all the ducks i&#8217; th&#8217; river. Go to, go to.</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CRES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nor nothing monstrous neither?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nothing but our undertakings, when we vow to weep seas, live in fire, eat rocks, tame tigers; thinking it harder for our mistress to devise imposition enough than for us to undergo any difficulty impos&#8217;d. This is the monstruosity in love, lady, that the will is infinite and the execution confin&#8217;d, that the desire is boundless and the act a slave to limit.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CRES.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>They say all lovers swear more performance than they are able, and yet reserve an ability that they never perform; vowing more than the perfection of ten, and discharging less than the tenth part of one. They that have the voice of lions and the act of hares, are they not monsters?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Are there such? Such are not we. Praise us as we are tasted, allow us as we prove. Our head shall go bare till merit crown it. No perfection in reversion shall have a praise in present; we will not name desert before his birth, and being born, his addition shall be humble. Few words to fair faith. Troilus shall be such to Cressid as what envy can say worst shall be a mock for his truth, and what truth can speak truest not truer than Troilus.</LINE>

<LINE>With the first glance that ever&#8212;pardon me,</LINE>
<LINE>If I confess much, you will play the tyrant.</LINE>
<LINE>I love you now, but till now not so much</LINE>
<LINE>But I might master it. In faith I lie,</LINE>
<LINE>My thoughts were like unbridled children grown</LINE>
<LINE>Too headstrong for their mother. See, we fools!</LINE>
<LINE>Why have I blabb&#8217;d? Who shall be true to us,</LINE>
<LINE>When we are so unsecret to ourselves?</LINE>
<LINE>But though I lov&#8217;d you well, I woo&#8217;d you not,</LINE>
<LINE>And yet, good faith, I wish&#8217;d myself a man,</LINE>
<LINE>Or that we women had men&#8217;s privilege</LINE>
<LINE>Of speaking first. Sweet, bid me hold my tongue,</LINE>
<LINE>For in this rapture I shall surely speak</LINE>
<LINE>The thing I shall repent. See, see, your silence,</LINE>
<LINE>Cunning in dumbness, from my weakness draws</LINE>
<LINE>My very soul of counsel! Stop my mouth.</LINE>

<LINE>To keep her constancy in plight and youth,</LINE>
<LINE>Outliving beauties outward, with a mind</LINE>
<LINE>That doth renew swifter than blood decays!</LINE>
<LINE>Or that persuasion could but thus convince me</LINE>
<LINE>That my integrity and truth to you</LINE>
<LINE>Might be affronted with the match and weight</LINE>
<LINE>Of such a winnowed purity in love!</LINE>
<LINE>How were I then uplifted! But alas,</LINE>

<LINE>Achilles stands i&#8217; th&#8217; entrance of his tent.</LINE>
<LINE>Please it our general pass strangely by him,</LINE>
<LINE>As if he were forgot, and, princes all,</LINE>
<LINE>Lay negligent and loose regard upon him.</LINE>
<LINE>I will come last; &#8217;tis like he&#8217;ll question me</LINE>
<LINE>Why such unplausive eyes are bent, why turn&#8217;d on him?</LINE>
<LINE>If so, I have derision medicinable</LINE>
<LINE>To use between your strangeness and his pride,</LINE>
<LINE>Which his own will shall have desire to drink.</LINE>
<LINE>It may do good, pride hath no other glass</LINE>
<LINE>To show itself but pride; for supple knees</LINE>
<LINE>Feed arrogance and are the proud man&#8217;s fees.</LINE>

<LINE>We&#8217;ll execute your purpose, and put on</LINE>

<LINE>So do each lord, and either greet him not,</LINE>
<LINE>Or else disdainfully, which shall shake him more</LINE>
<LINE>Than if not look&#8217;d on. I will lead the way.</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PATR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>They pass by strangely. They were us&#8217;d to bend,</LINE>
<LINE>To send their smiles before them to Achilles,</LINE>
<LINE>To come as humbly as they us&#8217;d to creep</LINE>
<LINE>To holy altars.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ACHIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="3">What, am I poor of late?</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis certain, greatness, once fall&#8217;n out with fortune,</LINE>
<LINE>Must fall out with men too. What the declin&#8217;d is,</LINE>
<LINE>He shall as soon read in the eyes of others</LINE>
<LINE>As feel in his own fall; for men, like butterflies,</LINE>
<LINE>Show not their mealy wings but to the summer,</LINE>
<LINE>And not a man, for being simply man,</LINE>
<LINE>Hath any honor, but honor for those honors</LINE>
<LINE>That are without him, as place, riches, and favor&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Prizes of accident as oft as merit,</LINE>
<LINE>Which when they fall, as being slippery standers,</LINE>
<LINE>The love that lean&#8217;d on them as slippery too,</LINE>
<LINE>Doth one pluck down another, and together</LINE>
<LINE>Die in the fall. But &#8217;tis not so with me,</LINE>
<LINE>Fortune and I are friends. I do enjoy</LINE>
<LINE>At ample point all that I did possess,</LINE>
<LINE>Save these men&#8217;s looks, who do methinks find out</LINE>
<LINE>Some thing not worth in me such rich beholding</LINE>
<LINE>As they have often given. Here is Ulysses,</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll interrupt his reading.</LINE>
<LINE>How now, Ulysses?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ULYSS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Now, great Thetis&#8217; son!</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ACHIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What are you reading?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ULYSS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">A strange fellow here</LINE>
<LINE>Writes me that man, how dearly ever parted,</LINE>
<LINE>How much in having, or without or in,</LINE>
<LINE>Cannot make boast to have that which he hath,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor feels not what he owes, but by reflection;</LINE>
<LINE>As when his virtues, aiming upon others,</LINE>
<LINE>Heat them, and they retort that heat again</LINE>
<LINE>To the first giver.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ACHIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">This is not strange, Ulysses.</LINE>
<LINE>The beauty that is borne here in the face</LINE>
<LINE>The bearer knows not, but commends itself</LINE>
<LINE>To others&#8217; eyes; nor doth the eye itself,</LINE>
<LINE>That most pure spirit of sense, behold itself,</LINE>
<LINE>Not going from itself; but eye to eye opposed,</LINE>
<LINE>Salutes each other with each other&#8217;s form;</LINE>
<LINE>For speculation turns not to itself,</LINE>
<LINE>Till it hath travell&#8217;d and is mirror&#8217;d there</LINE>
<LINE>Where it may see itself. This is not strange at all.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ULYSS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do not strain at the position&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>It is familiar&#8212;but at the author&#8217;s drift,</LINE>
<LINE>Who in his circumstance expressly proves</LINE>
<LINE>That no man is the lord of any thing,</LINE>
<LINE>Though in and of him there be much consisting,</LINE>
<LINE>Till he communicate his parts to others;</LINE>
<LINE>Nor doth he of himself know them for aught,</LINE>
<LINE>Till he behold them formed in th&#8217; applause</LINE>
<LINE>Where th&#8217; are extended; who like an arch reverb&#8217;rate</LINE>
<LINE>The voice again, or like a gate of steel,</LINE>
<LINE>Fronting the sun, receives and renders back</LINE>
<LINE>His figure and his heat. I was much rapt in this,</LINE>
<LINE>And apprehended here immediately</LINE>
<LINE>Th&#8217; unknown Ajax.</LINE>
<LINE>Heavens, what a man is there! A very horse,</LINE>
<LINE>That has he knows not what. Nature, what things there are</LINE>
<LINE>Most abject in regard, and dear in use!</LINE>
<LINE>What things again most dear in the esteem,</LINE>
<LINE>And poor in worth! Now shall we see tomorrow&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>An act that very chance doth throw upon him&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Ajax renown&#8217;d! O heavens, what some men do,</LINE>
<LINE>While some men leave to do!</LINE>
<LINE>How some men creep in skittish Fortune&#8217;s hall,</LINE>
<LINE>Whiles others play the idiots in her eyes!</LINE>
<LINE>How one man eats into another&#8217;s pride,</LINE>
<LINE>While pride is fasting in his wantonness!</LINE>
<LINE>To see these Grecian lords!&#8212;why, even already</LINE>
<LINE>They clap the lubber Ajax on the shoulder,</LINE>
<LINE>As if his foot were on brave Hector&#8217;s breast,</LINE>
<LINE>And great Troy shriking.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ACHIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do believe it, for they pass&#8217;d by me</LINE>
<LINE>As misers do by beggars, neither gave to me</LINE>
<LINE>Good word nor look. What, are my deeds forgot?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ULYSS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Time hath, my lord, a wallet at his back,</LINE>
<LINE>Wherein he puts alms for oblivion,</LINE>
<LINE>A great-siz&#8217;d monster of ingratitudes.</LINE>
<LINE>Those scraps are good deeds past, which are devour&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>As fast as they are made, forgot as soon</LINE>
<LINE>As done. Perseverance, dear my lord,</LINE>
<LINE>Keeps honor bright; to have done is to hang</LINE>
<LINE>Quite out of fashion, like a rusty mail</LINE>
<LINE>In monumental mock&#8217;ry. Take the instant way,</LINE>
<LINE>For honor travels in a strait so narrow,</LINE>
<LINE>Where one but goes abreast. Keep then the path,</LINE>
<LINE>For emulation hath a thousand sons</LINE>
<LINE>That one by one pursue. If you give way,</LINE>
<LINE>Or hedge aside from the direct forthright,</LINE>
<LINE>Like to an ent&#8217;red tide, they all rush by</LINE>
<LINE>And leave you hindmost;</LINE>
<LINE>Or like a gallant horse fall&#8217;n in first rank,</LINE>
<LINE>Lie there for pavement to the abject rear,</LINE>
<LINE>O&#8217;errun and trampled on. Then what they do in present,</LINE>
<LINE>Though less than yours in past, must o&#8217;ertop yours;</LINE>
<LINE>For Time is like a fashionable host</LINE>
<LINE>That slightly shakes his parting guest by th&#8217; hand,</LINE>
<LINE>And with his arms outstretch&#8217;d as he would fly,</LINE>
<LINE>Grasps in the comer. The welcome ever smiles,</LINE>
<LINE>And farewell goes out sighing. Let not virtue seek</LINE>
<LINE>Remuneration for the thing it was;</LINE>
<LINE>For beauty, wit,</LINE>
<LINE>High birth, vigor of bone, desert in service,</LINE>
<LINE>Love, friendship, charity, are subjects all</LINE>
<LINE>To envious and calumniating Time.</LINE>
<LINE>One touch of nature makes the whole world kin,</LINE>
<LINE>That all with one consent praise new-born gawds,</LINE>
<LINE>Though they are made and moulded of things past,</LINE>
<LINE>And give to dust, that is a little gilt,</LINE>
<LINE>More laud than gilt o&#8217;erdusted.</LINE>
<LINE>The present eye praises the present object.</LINE>
<LINE>Then marvel not, thou great and complete man,</LINE>
<LINE>That all the Greeks begin to worship Ajax;</LINE>
<LINE>Since things in motion sooner catch the eye</LINE>
<LINE>Than what stirs not. The cry went once on thee,</LINE>
<LINE>And still it might, and yet it may again,</LINE>
<LINE>If thou wouldst not entomb thyself alive</LINE>
<LINE>And case thy reputation in thy tent,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose glorious deeds but in these fields of late</LINE>
<LINE>Made emulous missions &#8217;mongst the gods themselves,</LINE>
<LINE>And drave great Mars to faction.</LINE>

<LINE offset="7">Of this my privacy</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEAKER>ULYSS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">But &#8217;gainst your privacy</LINE>
<LINE>The reasons are more potent and heroical.</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis known, Achilles, that you are in love</LINE>
<LINE>With one of Priam&#8217;s daughters.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ACHIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">Ha? Known?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ULYSS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is that a wonder?</LINE>
<LINE>The providence that&#8217;s in a watchful state</LINE>
<LINE>Knows almost every grain of Pluto&#8217;s gold,</LINE>
<LINE>Finds bottom in th&#8217; uncomprehensive depth,</LINE>
<LINE>Keeps place with thought and almost, like the gods,</LINE>
<LINE>Do thoughts unveil in their dumb cradles.</LINE>
<LINE>There is a mystery (with whom relation</LINE>
<LINE>Durst never meddle) in the soul of state,</LINE>
<LINE>Which hath an operation more divine</LINE>
<LINE>Than breath or pen can give expressure to.</LINE>
<LINE>All the commerce that you have had with Troy</LINE>
<LINE>As perfectly is ours as yours, my lord,</LINE>
<LINE>And better would it fit Achilles much</LINE>
<LINE>To throw down Hector than Polyxena.</LINE>
<LINE>But it must grieve young Pyrrhus now at home,</LINE>
<LINE>When fame shall in our islands sound her trump,</LINE>
<LINE>And all the Greekish girls shall tripping sing,</LINE>
<LINE>&#8220;Great Hector&#8217;s sister did Achilles win,</LINE>
<LINE>But our great Ajax bravely beat down him.&#8221;</LINE>
<LINE>Farewell, my lord; I as your lover speak:</LINE>
<LINE>The fool slides o&#8217;er the ice that you should break.</LINE>

<LINE>In time of action. I stand condemn&#8217;d for this;</LINE>
<LINE>They think my little stomach to the war,</LINE>
<LINE>And your great love to me, restrains you thus.</LINE>
<LINE>Sweet, rouse yourself, and the weak wanton Cupid</LINE>
<LINE>Shall from your neck unloose his amorous fold,</LINE>

<LINE>My fame is shrowdly gor&#8217;d.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>PATR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">O then beware!</LINE>
<LINE>Those wounds heal ill that men do give themselves.</LINE>
<LINE>Omission to do what is necessary</LINE>
<LINE>Seals a commission to a blank of danger,</LINE>
<LINE>And danger like an ague subtly taints</LINE>
<LINE>Even then when they sit idly in the sun.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ACHIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go call Thersites hither, sweet Patroclus.</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll send the fool to Ajax and desire him</LINE>
<LINE>T&#8217; invite the Troyan lords after the combat</LINE>
<LINE>To see us here unarm&#8217;d. I have a woman&#8217;s longing,</LINE>
<LINE>An appetite that I am sick withal,</LINE>
<LINE>To see great Hector in his weeds of peace,</LINE>
<LINE>To talk with him, and to behold his visage,</LINE>
<LINE>Even to my full of view.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Thersites.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE offset="5">A labor sav&#8217;d!</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ACHIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ajax goes up and down the field, asking for himself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ACHIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How so?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He must fight singly tomorrow with Hector, and is so prophetically proud of an heroical cudgelling that he raves in saying nothing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ACHIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How can that be?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, &#8217;a stalks up and down like a peacock&#8212;a stride and a stand; ruminates like an hostess that hath no arithmetic but her brain to set down her reckoning; bites his lip with a politic regard, as who should say there were wit in this head and &#8217;twould out&#8212;and so there is; but it lies as coldly in him as fire in a flint, which will not show without knocking. The man&#8217;s undone forever, for if Hector break not his neck i&#8217; th&#8217; combat, he&#8217;ll break&#8217;t himself in vainglory. He knows not me. I said, &#8220;Good morrow, Ajax&#8221;; and he replies, &#8220;Thanks, Agamemnon.&#8221; What think you of this man that takes me for the general? He&#8217;s grown a very land-fish, languageless, a monster. A plague of opinion! A man may wear it on both sides, like a leather jerkin.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ACHIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou must be my ambassador to him, Thersites.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who, I? Why, he&#8217;ll answer nobody; he professes not answering. Speaking is for beggars; he wears his tongue in &#8217;s arms. I will put on his presence, let Patroclus make demands to me; you shall see the pageant of Ajax.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ACHIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To him, Patroclus. Tell him I humbly desire the valiant Ajax to invite the most valorous Hector to come unarm&#8217;d to my tent, and to procure safe-conduct for his person of the magnanimous and most illustrious six-or-seven-times-honor&#8217;d captain-general of the army, Agamemnon, et cetera.

<LINE>No; but he&#8217;s out of tune thus. What music will be in him when Hector has knock&#8217;d out his brains, I know not; but I am sure none, unless the fiddler Apollo get his sinews to make catlings on.</LINE>

<LINE>Grecian, thou dost not use me courteously,</LINE>

<LINE>O, these encounterers, so glib of tongue,</LINE>
<LINE>That give a coasting welcome ere it comes,</LINE>
<LINE>And wide unclasp the tables of their thoughts</LINE>

<LINE>The Troyans&#8217; trumpet.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter all of Troy: Hector armed, Paris, Aeneas, Helenus, Troilus, and Attendants.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AGAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Yonder comes the troop.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hail, all the state of Greece! What shall be done</LINE>
<LINE>To him that victory commands? Or do you purpose</LINE>
<LINE>A victor shall be known? Will you the knights</LINE>
<LINE>Shall to the edge of all extremity</LINE>
<LINE>Pursue each other, or shall they be divided</LINE>
<LINE>By any voice or order of the field?</LINE>
<LINE>Hector bade ask.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AGAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="3">Which way would Hector have it?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He cares not, he&#8217;ll obey conditions.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AGAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis done like Hector.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ACHIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">But securely done,</LINE>
<LINE>A little proudly, and great deal misprising</LINE>
<LINE>The knight oppos&#8217;d.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">If not Achilles, sir,</LINE>
<LINE>What is your name?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ACHIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">If not Achilles, nothing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Therefore Achilles, but what e&#8217;er, know this:</LINE>
<LINE>In the extremity of great and little,</LINE>
<LINE>Valor and pride excel themselves in Hector,</LINE>
<LINE>The one almost as infinite as all,</LINE>
<LINE>The other blank as nothing. Weigh him well,</LINE>
<LINE>And that which looks like pride is courtesy.</LINE>
<LINE>This Ajax is half made of Hector&#8217;s blood,</LINE>
<LINE>In love whereof, half Hector stays at home;</LINE>
<LINE>Half heart, half hand, half Hector comes to seek</LINE>
<LINE>This blended knight, half Troyan and half Greek.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ACHIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A maiden battle then? O, I perceive you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Diomedes.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AGAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here is Sir Diomed. Go, gentle knight,</LINE>
<LINE>Stand by our Ajax. As you and Lord Aeneas</LINE>
<LINE>Consent upon the order of their fight,</LINE>
<LINE>So be it, either to the uttermost,</LINE>
<LINE>Or else a breath. The combatants being kin</LINE>
<LINE>Half stints their strife before their strokes begin.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Ajax and Hector enter the lists.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ULYSS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>They are oppos&#8217;d already.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AGAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What Troyan is that same that looks so heavy?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ULYSS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The youngest son of Priam, a true knight,</LINE>
<LINE>Not yet mature, yet matchless, firm of word,</LINE>
<LINE>Speaking in deeds, and deedless in his tongue,</LINE>
<LINE>Not soon provok&#8217;d, nor being provok&#8217;d soon calm&#8217;d;</LINE>
<LINE>His heart and hand both open and both free,</LINE>
<LINE>For what he has he gives, what thinks he shows,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet gives he not till judgment guide his bounty,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor dignifies an impare thought with breath;</LINE>
<LINE>Manly as Hector, but more dangerous,</LINE>
<LINE>For Hector in his blaze of wrath subscribes</LINE>
<LINE>To tender objects, but he in heat of action</LINE>
<LINE>Is more vindicative than jealous love.</LINE>
<LINE>They call him Troilus, and on him erect</LINE>
<LINE>A second hope, as fairly built as Hector.</LINE>
<LINE>Thus says Aeneas, one that knows the youth</LINE>
<LINE>Even to his inches, and with private soul</LINE>
<LINE>Did in great Ilion thus translate him to me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Alarum. Hector and Ajax fight.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AGAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>They are in action.</LINE>

<LINE>Awake thee!</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>His blows are well dispos&#8217;d. There, Ajax!</LINE>

<LINE>You must no more.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DIO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As Hector pleases.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HECT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Why then will I no more.</LINE>
<LINE>Thou art, great lord, my father&#8217;s sister&#8217;s son,</LINE>
<LINE>A cousin-german to great Priam&#8217;s seed;</LINE>
<LINE>The obligation of our blood forbids</LINE>
<LINE>A gory emulation &#8217;twixt us twain.</LINE>
<LINE>Were thy commixtion Greek and Troyan so</LINE>
<LINE>That thou couldst say, &#8220;This hand is Grecian all,</LINE>
<LINE>And this is Troyan; the sinews of this leg</LINE>
<LINE>All Greek, and this all Troy; my mother&#8217;s blood</LINE>
<LINE>Runs on the dexter cheek, and this sinister</LINE>
<LINE>Bounds in my father&#8217;s&#8221; : by Jove multipotent,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou shouldst not bear from me a Greekish member</LINE>
<LINE>Wherein my sword had not impressure made</LINE>
<LINE>Of our rank feud; but the just gods gainsay</LINE>
<LINE>That any drop thou borrow&#8217;dst from thy mother,</LINE>
<LINE>My sacred aunt, should by my mortal sword</LINE>
<LINE>Be drained! Let me embrace thee, Ajax.</LINE>
<LINE>By him that thunders, thou hast lusty arms!</LINE>
<LINE>Hector would have them fall upon him thus.</LINE>
<LINE>Cousin, all honor to thee!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AJAX.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">I thank thee, Hector.</LINE>
<LINE>Thou art too gentle and too free a man.</LINE>
<LINE>I came to kill thee, cousin, and bear hence</LINE>
<LINE>A great addition earned in thy death.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HECT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not Neoptolemus so mirable,</LINE>
<LINE>On whose bright crest Fame with her loud&#8217;st Oyes</LINE>
<LINE>Cries, &#8220;This is he,&#8221; could promise to himself</LINE>
<LINE>A thought of added honor torn from Hector.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There is expectance here from both the sides,</LINE>
<LINE>What further you will do.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HECT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">We&#8217;ll answer it:</LINE>
<LINE>The issue is embracement. Ajax, farewell.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AJAX.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If I might in entreaties find success,</LINE>
<LINE>As seld I have the chance, I would desire</LINE>
<LINE>My famous cousin to our Grecian tents.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DIO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis Agamemnon&#8217;s wish, and great Achilles</LINE>
<LINE>Doth long to see unarm&#8217;d the valiant Hector.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HECT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Aeneas, call my brother Troilus to me,</LINE>
<LINE>And signify this loving interview</LINE>
<LINE>To the expecters of our Troyan part;</LINE>
<LINE>Desire them home. Give me thy hand, my cousin.</LINE>
<LINE>I will go eat with thee and see your knights.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Agamemnon and the rest come forward.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Great Agamemnon comes to meet us here.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HECT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The worthiest of them tell me name by name;</LINE>
<LINE>But for Achilles, my own searching eyes</LINE>
<LINE>Shall find him by his large and portly size.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AGAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Worthy all arms! As welcome as to one</LINE>
<LINE>That would be rid of such an enemy.</LINE>
<LINE>But that&#8217;s no welcome. Understand more clear,</LINE>
<LINE>What&#8217;s past and what&#8217;s to come is strew&#8217;d with husks</LINE>
<LINE>And formless ruin of oblivion;</LINE>
<LINE>But in this extant moment, faith and troth,</LINE>
<LINE>Strain&#8217;d purely from all hollow bias-drawing,</LINE>
<LINE>Bids thee, with most divine integrity,</LINE>
<LINE>From heart of very heart, great Hector, welcome.</LINE>

<LINE>You brace of warlike brothers, welcome hither.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HECT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who must we answer?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">The noble Menelaus.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HECT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, you, my lord? By Mars his gauntlet, thanks!</LINE>
<LINE>Mock not that I affect th&#8217; untraded oath,</LINE>
<LINE>Your quondam wife swears still by Venus&#8217; glove.</LINE>
<LINE>She&#8217;s well, but bade me not commend her to you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Name her not now, sir, she&#8217;s a deadly theme.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HECT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, pardon, I offend.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NEST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have, thou gallant Troyan, seen thee oft,</LINE>
<LINE>Laboring for destiny, make cruel way</LINE>
<LINE>Through ranks of Greekish youth, and I have seen thee,</LINE>
<LINE>As hot as Perseus, spur thy Phrygian steed,</LINE>
<LINE>Despising many forfeits and subduements,</LINE>
<LINE>When thou hast hung thy advanced sword i&#8217; th&#8217; air,</LINE>
<LINE>Not letting it decline on the declined,</LINE>
<LINE>That I have said to some my standers-by</LINE>
<LINE>&#8220;Lo Jupiter is yonder, dealing life!&#8221;</LINE>
<LINE>And I have seen thee pause and take thy breath,</LINE>
<LINE>When that a ring of Greeks have hemm&#8217;d thee in,</LINE>
<LINE>Like an Olympian wrastling. This have I seen,</LINE>
<LINE>But this thy countenance, still lock&#8217;d in steel,</LINE>
<LINE>I never saw till now. I knew thy grandsire,</LINE>
<LINE>And once fought with him. He was a soldier good,</LINE>
<LINE>But, by great Mars, the captain of us all,</LINE>
<LINE>Never like thee. O, let an old man embrace thee,</LINE>
<LINE>And, worthy warrior, welcome to our tents.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AENE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis the old Nestor.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HECT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let me embrace thee, good old chronicle,</LINE>
<LINE>That hast so long walk&#8217;d hand in hand with time.</LINE>
<LINE>Most reverend Nestor, I am glad to clasp thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NEST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would my arms could match thee in contention,</LINE>

<LINE>I would they could.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NEST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ha!</LINE>
<LINE>By this white beard, I&#8217;d fight with thee tomorrow.</LINE>
<LINE>Well, welcome, welcome!&#8212;I have seen the time.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ULYSS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I wonder now how yonder city stands</LINE>
<LINE>When we have here her base and pillar by us.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HECT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know your favor, Lord Ulysses, well.</LINE>
<LINE>Ah, sir, there&#8217;s many a Greek and Troyan dead</LINE>
<LINE>Since first I saw yourself and Diomed</LINE>
<LINE>In Ilion, on your Greekish embassy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ULYSS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, I foretold you then what would ensue.</LINE>
<LINE>My prophecy is but half his journey yet,</LINE>
<LINE>For yonder walls that pertly front your town,</LINE>
<LINE>Yon towers, whose wanton tops do buss the clouds,</LINE>
<LINE>Must kiss their own feet.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HECT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">I must not believe you.</LINE>
<LINE>There they stand yet, and modestly I think</LINE>
<LINE>The fall of every Phrygian stone will cost</LINE>
<LINE>A drop of Grecian blood. The end crowns all,</LINE>
<LINE>And that old common arbitrator, Time,</LINE>
<LINE>Will one day end it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>With too much blood and too little brain, these two may run mad, but, if with too much brain and too little blood they do, I&#8217;ll be a curer of madmen. Here&#8217;s Agamemnon, an honest fellow enough, and one that loves quails, but he has not so much brain as ear-wax; and the goodly transformation of Jupiter there, his brother, the bull, the primitive statue and oblique memorial of cuckolds, a thrifty shoeing-horn in a chain, hanging at his brother&#8217;s leg&#8212;to what form but that he is, should wit larded with malice, and malice fac&#8217;d with wit, turn him to? To an ass, were nothing, he is both ass and ox; to an ox, were nothing, he is both ox and ass. To be a dog, a moile, a cat, a fitchook, a toad, a lezard, an owl, a puttock, or a herring without a roe, I would not care; but to be Menelaus, I would conspire against destiny. Ask me not what I would be if I were not Thersites, for I care not to be the louse of a lazar, so I were not Menelaus. Hey-day! Sprites and fires!</LINE>

I will rather leave to see Hector than not to dog him. They say he keeps a Troyan drab, and uses the traitor Calchas&#8217; tent. I&#8217;ll after&#8212;nothing but lechery!
