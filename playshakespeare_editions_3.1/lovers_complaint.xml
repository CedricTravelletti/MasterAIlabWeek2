<TITLESHORT>A Lover&#8217;s Complaint</TITLESHORT>
<PLAYWRIGHT>William Shakespeare</PLAYWRIGHT>

<POEMBODY>

<STANZA>
<LINE>From off a hill whose concave womb reworded</LINE>
<LINE>A plaintful story from a sist&#8217;ring vale,</LINE>
<LINE>My spirits t&#8217; attend this double voice accorded,</LINE>
<LINE>And down I laid to list the sad-tun&#8217;d tale,</LINE>
<LINE>Ere long espied a fickle maid full pale</LINE>
<LINE>Tearing of papers, breaking rings a-twain,</LINE>
<LINE>Storming her world with sorrow&#8217;s wind and rain.</LINE>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Upon her head a platted hive of straw,</LINE>
<LINE>Which fortified her visage from the sun,</LINE>
<LINE>Whereon the thought might think sometime it saw</LINE>
<LINE>The carcass of a beauty spent and done.</LINE>
<LINE>Time had not scythed all that youth begun,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor youth all quit, but spite of heaven&#8217;s fell rage,</LINE>
<LINE>Some beauty peep&#8217;d through lettice of sear&#8217;d age.</LINE>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Oft did she heave her napkin to her eyne,</LINE>
<LINE>Which on it had conceited characters,</LINE>
<LINE>Laund&#8217;ring the silken figures in the brine</LINE>
<LINE>That seasoned woe had pelleted in tears,</LINE>
<LINE>And often reading what contents it bears;</LINE>
<LINE>As often shriking undistinguish&#8217;d woe,</LINE>
<LINE>In clamors of all size, both high and low.</LINE>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Sometimes her levell&#8217;d eyes their carriage ride,</LINE>
<LINE>As they did batt&#8217;ry to the spheres intend;</LINE>
<LINE>Sometime diverted their poor balls are tied</LINE>
<LINE>To th&#8217; orbed earth; sometimes they do extend</LINE>
<LINE>Their view right on; anon their gazes lend</LINE>
<LINE>To every place at once, and no where fix&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>The mind and sight distractedly commix&#8217;d.</LINE>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Her hair, nor loose nor tied in formal plat,</LINE>
<LINE>Proclaim&#8217;d in her a careless hand of pride;</LINE>
<LINE>For some untuck&#8217;d descended her sheav&#8217;d hat,</LINE>
<LINE>Hanging her pale and pined cheek beside;</LINE>
<LINE>Some in her threaden fillet still did bide,</LINE>
<LINE>And true to bondage would not break from thence,</LINE>
<LINE>Though slackly braided in loose negligence.</LINE>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>A thousand favors from a maund she drew,</LINE>
<LINE>Of amber, crystal, and of beaded jet,</LINE>
<LINE>Which one by one she in a river threw,</LINE>
<LINE>Upon whose weeping margent she was set,</LINE>
<LINE>Like usury applying wet to wet,</LINE>
<LINE>Or monarch&#8217;s hands that lets not bounty fall</LINE>
<LINE>Where want cries some, but where excess begs all.</LINE>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>Of folded schedules had she many a one,</LINE>
<LINE>Which she perus&#8217;d, sigh&#8217;d, tore, and gave the flood,</LINE>
<LINE>Crack&#8217;d many a ring of posied gold and bone,</LINE>
<LINE>Bidding them find their sepulchres in mud,</LINE>
<LINE>Found yet more letters sadly penn&#8217;d in blood,</LINE>
<LINE>With sleided silk feat and affectedly</LINE>
<LINE>Enswath&#8217;d and seal&#8217;d to curious secrecy.</LINE>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>These often bath&#8217;d she in her fluxive eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>And often kiss&#8217;d, and often gan to tear;</LINE>
<LINE>Cried, &#8220;O false blood, thou register of lies,</LINE>
<LINE>What unapproved witness dost thou bear!</LINE>
<LINE>Ink would have seem&#8217;d more black and damned here!&#8221;</LINE>
<LINE>This said, in top of rage the lines she rents,</LINE>
<LINE>Big discontent so breaking their contents.</LINE>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>A reverend man that graz&#8217;d his cattle nigh,</LINE>
<LINE>Sometime a blusterer that the ruffle knew</LINE>
<LINE>Of court, of city, and had let go by</LINE>
<LINE>The swiftest hours, observed as they flew,</LINE>
<LINE>Towards this afflicted fancy fastly drew,</LINE>
<LINE>And privileg&#8217;d by age desires to know</LINE>
<LINE>In brief the grounds and motives of her woe.</LINE>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>So slides he down upon his grained bat,</LINE>
<LINE>And comely distant sits he by her side,</LINE>
<LINE>When he again desires her, being sat,</LINE>
<LINE>Her grievance with his hearing to divide:</LINE>
<LINE>If that from him there may be aught applied</LINE>
<LINE>Which may her suffering ecstasy assuage,</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis promis&#8217;d in the charity of age.</LINE>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>&#8220;Father,&#8221; she says, &#8220;though in me you behold</LINE>
<LINE>The injury of many a blasting hour,</LINE>
<LINE>Let it not tell your judgment I am old,</LINE>
<LINE>Not age, but sorrow, over me hath power;</LINE>
<LINE>I might as yet have been a spreading flower,</LINE>
<LINE>Fresh to myself, if I had self-applied</LINE>
<LINE>Love to myself, and to no love beside.</LINE>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>&#8220;But woe is me, too early I attended</LINE>
<LINE>A youthful suitâ€”it was to gain my grace;</LINE>
<LINE>O, one by nature&#8217;s outwards so commended</LINE>
<LINE>That maidens&#8217; eyes stuck over all his face.</LINE>
<LINE>Love lack&#8217;d a dwelling and made him her place;</LINE>
<LINE>And when in his fair parts she did abide,</LINE>
<LINE>She was new lodg&#8217;d and newly deified.</LINE>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>&#8220;His browny locks did hang in crooked curls,</LINE>
<LINE>And every light occasion of the wind</LINE>
<LINE>Upon his lips their silken parcels hurls.</LINE>
<LINE>What&#8217;s sweet to do, to do will aptly find:</LINE>
<LINE>Each eye that saw him did enchant the mind,</LINE>
<LINE>For on his visage was in little drawn</LINE>
<LINE>What largeness thinks in Paradise was sawn.</LINE>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>&#8220;Small show of man was yet upon his chin,</LINE>
<LINE>His phoenix down began but to appear</LINE>
<LINE>Like unshorn velvet on that termless skin,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose bare outbragg&#8217;d the web it seem&#8217;d to wear;</LINE>
<LINE>Yet showed his visage by that cost more dear,</LINE>
<LINE>And nice affections wavering stood in doubt</LINE>
<LINE>If best were as it was, or best without.</LINE>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>&#8220;His qualities were beauteous as his form,</LINE>
<LINE>For maiden-tongu&#8217;d he was, and thereof free;</LINE>
<LINE>Yet if men mov&#8217;d him, was he such a storm</LINE>
<LINE>As oft &#8217;twixt May and April is to see,</LINE>
<LINE>When winds breathe sweet, unruly though they be.</LINE>
<LINE>His rudeness so with his authoriz&#8217;d youth</LINE>
<LINE>Did livery falseness in a pride of truth.</LINE>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>&#8220;Well could he ride, and often men would say,</LINE>
<LINE>&#8216;That horse his mettle from his rider takes;</LINE>
<LINE>Proud of subjection, noble by the sway,</LINE>
<LINE>What rounds, what bounds, what course, what stop he makes!&#8217;</LINE>
<LINE>And controversy hence a question takes,</LINE>
<LINE>Whether the horse by him became his deed,</LINE>
<LINE>Or he his manage by th&#8217; well-doing steed.</LINE>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>&#8220;But quickly on this side the verdict went:</LINE>
<LINE>His real habitude gave life and grace</LINE>
<LINE>To appertainings and to ornament,</LINE>
<LINE>Accomplish&#8217;d in himself, not in his case;</LINE>
<LINE>All aids, themselves made fairer by their place,</LINE>
<LINE>Came for additions, yet their purpos&#8217;d trim</LINE>
<LINE>Piec&#8217;d not his grace but were all grac&#8217;d by him.</LINE>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>&#8220;So on the tip of his subduing tongue</LINE>
<LINE>All kind of arguments and question deep,</LINE>
<LINE>All replication prompt and reason strong,</LINE>
<LINE>For his advantage still did wake and sleep.</LINE>
<LINE>To make the weeper laugh, the laugher weep,</LINE>
<LINE>He had the dialect and different skill,</LINE>
<LINE>Catching all passions in his craft of will,</LINE>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>&#8220;That he did in the general bosom reign</LINE>
<LINE>Of young, of old, and sexes both enchanted,</LINE>
<LINE>To dwell with him in thoughts, or to remain</LINE>
<LINE>In personal duty, following where he haunted.</LINE>
<LINE>Consents bewitch&#8217;d, ere he desire, have granted,</LINE>
<LINE>And dialogu&#8217;d for him what he would say,</LINE>
<LINE>Ask&#8217;d their own wills and made their wills obey.</LINE>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>&#8220;Many there were that did his picture get</LINE>
<LINE>To serve their eyes, and in it put their mind,</LINE>
<LINE>Like fools that in th&#8217; imagination set</LINE>
<LINE>The goodly objects which abroad they find</LINE>
<LINE>Of lands and mansions, theirs in thought assign&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>And laboring in more pleasures to bestow them</LINE>
<LINE>Than the true gouty landlord which doth owe them.</LINE>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>&#8220;So many have that never touch&#8217;d his hand</LINE>
<LINE>Sweetly suppos&#8217;d them mistress of his heart.</LINE>
<LINE>My woeful self that did in freedom stand,</LINE>
<LINE>And was my own fee-simple (not in part),</LINE>
<LINE>What with his art in youth and youth in art,</LINE>
<LINE>Threw my affections in his charmed power,</LINE>
<LINE>Reserv&#8217;d the stalk and gave him all my flower.</LINE>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>&#8220;Yet did I not as some my equals did</LINE>
<LINE>Demand of him, nor being desired yielded;</LINE>
<LINE>Finding myself in honor so forbid,</LINE>
<LINE>With safest distance I mine honor shielded.</LINE>
<LINE>Experience for me many bulwarks builded</LINE>
<LINE>Of proofs new-bleeding which remain&#8217;d the foil</LINE>
<LINE>Of this false jewel, and his amorous spoil.</LINE>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>&#8220;But ah, who ever shunn&#8217;d by precedent</LINE>
<LINE>The destin&#8217;d ill she must herself assay,</LINE>
<LINE>Or forc&#8217;d examples &#8217;gainst her own content</LINE>
<LINE>To put the by-past perils in her way?</LINE>
<LINE>Counsel may stop a while what will not stay;</LINE>
<LINE>For when we rage, advice is often seen</LINE>
<LINE>By blunting us to make our wits more keen.</LINE>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>&#8220;Nor gives it satisfaction to our blood</LINE>
<LINE>That we must curb it upon others&#8217; proof,</LINE>
<LINE>To be forbod the sweets that seems so good</LINE>
<LINE>For fear of harms that preach in our behoof.</LINE>
<LINE>O appetite, from judgment stand aloof!</LINE>
<LINE>The one a palate hath that needs will taste,</LINE>
<LINE>Though Reason weep and cry, &#8216;It is thy last.&#8217;</LINE>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>&#8220;For further I could say this man&#8217;s untrue,</LINE>
<LINE>And knew the patterns of his foul beguiling,</LINE>
<LINE>Heard where his plants in others&#8217; orchards grew,</LINE>
<LINE>Saw how deceits were gilded in his smiling,</LINE>
<LINE>Knew vows were ever brokers to defiling,</LINE>
<LINE>Thought characters and words merely but art,</LINE>
<LINE>And bastards of his foul adulterate heart.</LINE>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>&#8220;And long upon these terms I held my city,</LINE>
<LINE>Till thus he gan besiege me: &#8216;Gentle maid,</LINE>
<LINE>Have of my suffering youth some feeling pity</LINE>
<LINE>And be not of my holy vows afraid.</LINE>
<LINE>That&#8217;s to ye sworn to none was ever said,</LINE>
<LINE>For feasts of love I have been call&#8217;d unto,</LINE>
<LINE>Till now did ne&#8217;er invite nor never vow.</LINE>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>&#8220;&#8216;All my offenses that abroad you see</LINE>
<LINE>Are errors of the blood, none of the mind;</LINE>
<LINE>Love made them not, with acture they may be,</LINE>
<LINE>Where neither party is nor true nor kind:</LINE>
<LINE>They sought their shame that so their shame did find,</LINE>
<LINE>And so much less of shame in me remains</LINE>
<LINE>By how much of me their reproach contains.</LINE>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>&#8220;&#8216;Among the many that mine eyes have seen,</LINE>
<LINE>Not one whose flame my heart so much as warmed,</LINE>
<LINE>Or my affection put to th&#8217; smallest teen,</LINE>
<LINE>Or any of my leisures ever charmed.</LINE>
<LINE>Harm have I done to them but ne&#8217;er was harmed,</LINE>
<LINE>Kept hearts in liveries, but mine own was free,</LINE>
<LINE>And reign&#8217;d commanding in his monarchy.</LINE>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>&#8220;&#8216;Look here what tributes wounded fancies sent me,</LINE>
<LINE>Of pallid pearls and rubies red as blood:</LINE>
<LINE>Figuring that they their passions likewise lent me</LINE>
<LINE>Of grief and blushes, aptly understood</LINE>
<LINE>In bloodless white and the encrimson&#8217;d mood,</LINE>
<LINE>Effects of terror and dear modesty,</LINE>
<LINE>Encamp&#8217;d in hearts but fighting outwardly.</LINE>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>&#8220;&#8216;And lo behold these talents of their hair,</LINE>
<LINE>With twisted metal amorously impleach&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>I have receiv&#8217;d from many a several fair,</LINE>
<LINE>Their kind acceptance weepingly beseech&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>With th&#8217; annexions of fair gems enrich&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>And deep-brain&#8217;d sonnets that did amplify</LINE>
<LINE>Each stone&#8217;s dear nature, worth, and quality.</LINE>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>&#8220;&#8216;The diamond? why, &#8217;twas beautiful and hard,</LINE>
<LINE>Whereto his invis&#8217;d properties did tend;</LINE>
<LINE>The deep-green em&#8217;rald, in whose fresh regard</LINE>
<LINE>Weak sights their sickly radiance do amend;</LINE>
<LINE>The heaven-hu&#8217;d sapphire and the opal blend</LINE>
<LINE>With objects manifold: each several stone,</LINE>
<LINE>With wit well blazon&#8217;d, smil&#8217;d or made some moan.</LINE>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>&#8220;&#8216;Lo all these trophies of affections hot,</LINE>
<LINE>Of pensiv&#8217;d and subdu&#8217;d desires the tender,</LINE>
<LINE>Nature hath charg&#8217;d me that I hoard them not,</LINE>
<LINE>But yield them up where I myself must render:</LINE>
<LINE>That is to you, my origin and ender;</LINE>
<LINE>For these of force must your oblations be,</LINE>
<LINE>Since I their altar, you enpatron me.</LINE>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>&#8220;&#8216;O then advance (of yours) that phraseless hand,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose white weighs down the airy scale of praise,</LINE>
<LINE>Take all these similes to your own command,</LINE>
<LINE>Hallowed with sighs that burning lungs did raise;</LINE>
<LINE>What me, your minister, for you obeys,</LINE>
<LINE>Works under you, and to your audit comes</LINE>
<LINE>Their distract parcels in combined sums.</LINE>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>&#8220;&#8216;Lo this device was sent me from a nun,</LINE>
<LINE>Or sister sanctified, of holiest note,</LINE>
<LINE>Which late her noble suit in court did shun,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose rarest havings made the blossoms dote,</LINE>
<LINE>For she was sought by spirits of richest coat,</LINE>
<LINE>But kept cold distance, and did thence remove</LINE>
<LINE>To spend her living in eternal love.</LINE>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>&#8220;&#8216;But, O my sweet, what labor is&#8217;t to leave</LINE>
<LINE>The thing we have not, mast&#8217;ring what not strives,</LINE>
<LINE>Playing the place which did no form receive,</LINE>
<LINE>Playing patient sports in unconstrained gyves?</LINE>
<LINE>She that her fame so to herself contrives,</LINE>
<LINE>The scars of battle scapeth by the flight,</LINE>
<LINE>And makes her absence valiant, not her might.</LINE>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>&#8220;&#8216;O, pardon me, in that my boast is true:</LINE>
<LINE>The accident which brought me to her eye</LINE>
<LINE>Upon the moment did her force subdue,</LINE>
<LINE>And now she would the caged cloister fly:</LINE>
<LINE>Religious love put out religion&#8217;s eye.</LINE>
<LINE>Not to be tempted would she be enur&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>And now to tempt all liberty procur&#8217;d.</LINE>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>&#8220;&#8216;How mighty then you are, O, hear me tell!</LINE>
<LINE>The broken bosoms that to me belong</LINE>
<LINE>Have emptied all their fountains in my well,</LINE>
<LINE>And mine I pour your ocean all among:</LINE>
<LINE>I strong o&#8217;er them, and you o&#8217;er me being strong,</LINE>
<LINE>Must for your victory us all congest,</LINE>
<LINE>As compound love to physic your cold breast.</LINE>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>&#8220;&#8216;My parts had pow&#8217;r to charm a sacred nun,</LINE>
<LINE>Who disciplin&#8217;d, ay, dieted in grace,</LINE>
<LINE>Believ&#8217;d her eyes when they t&#8217; assail begun,</LINE>
<LINE>All vows and consecrations giving place.</LINE>
<LINE>O most potential love! vow, bond, nor space</LINE>
<LINE>In thee hath neither sting, knot, nor confine,</LINE>
<LINE>For thou art all, and all things else are thine.</LINE>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>&#8220;&#8216;When thou impressest, what are precepts worth</LINE>
<LINE>Of stale example? When thou wilt inflame,</LINE>
<LINE>How coldly those impediments stand forth</LINE>
<LINE>Of wealth, of filial fear, law, kindred, fame!</LINE>
<LINE>Love&#8217;s arms are peace, &#8217;gainst rule, &#8217;gainst sense, &#8217;gainst shame,</LINE>
<LINE>And sweetens, in the suff&#8217;ring pangs it bears,</LINE>
<LINE>The aloes of all forces, shocks, and fears.</LINE>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>&#8220;&#8216;Now all these hearts that do on mine depend,</LINE>
<LINE>Feeling it break, with bleeding groans they pine,</LINE>
<LINE>And supplicant their sighs to you extend</LINE>
<LINE>To leave the batt&#8217;ry that you make &#8217;gainst mine,</LINE>
<LINE>Lending soft audience to my sweet design,</LINE>
<LINE>And credent soul to that strong-bonded oath</LINE>
<LINE>That shall prefer and undertake my troth.&#8217;</LINE>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>&#8220;This said, his wat&#8217;ry eyes he did dismount,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose sights till then were levell&#8217;d on my face,</LINE>
<LINE>Each cheek a river running from a fount</LINE>
<LINE>With brinish current downward flow&#8217;d apace:</LINE>
<LINE>O how the channel to the stream gave grace!</LINE>
<LINE>Who glaz&#8217;d with crystal gate the glowing roses</LINE>
<LINE>That flame through water which their hue encloses.</LINE>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>&#8220;O father, what a hell of witchcraft lies</LINE>
<LINE>In the small orb of one particular tear!</LINE>
<LINE>But with the inundation of the eyes</LINE>
<LINE>What rocky heart to water will not wear?</LINE>
<LINE>What breast so cold that is not warmed here?</LINE>
<LINE>O cleft effect! cold modesty, hot wrath,</LINE>
<LINE>Both fire from hence and chill extincture hath.</LINE>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>&#8220;For lo his passion, but an art of craft,</LINE>
<LINE>Even there resolv&#8217;d my reason into tears,</LINE>
<LINE>There my white stole of chastity I daff&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Shook off my sober guards and civil fears;</LINE>
<LINE>Appear to him as he to me appears,</LINE>
<LINE>All melting, though our drops this diff&#8217;rence bore:</LINE>
<LINE>His poison&#8217;d me, and mine did him restore.</LINE>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>&#8220;In him a plenitude of subtle matter,</LINE>
<LINE>Applied to cautels, all strange forms receives,</LINE>
<LINE>Of burning blushes, or of weeping water,</LINE>
<LINE>Or sounding paleness; and he takes and leaves,</LINE>
<LINE>In either&#8217;s aptness as it best deceives,</LINE>
<LINE>To blush at speeches rank, to weep at woes,</LINE>
<LINE>Or to turn white and sound at tragic shows;</LINE>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>&#8220;That not a heart which in his level came</LINE>
<LINE>Could scape the hail of his all-hurting aim,</LINE>
<LINE>Showing fair nature is both kind and tame;</LINE>
<LINE>And veil&#8217;d in them did win whom he would maim.</LINE>
<LINE>Against the thing he sought he would exclaim:</LINE>
<LINE>When he most burnt in heart-wish&#8217;d luxury,</LINE>
<LINE>He preach&#8217;d pure maid, and prais&#8217;d cold chastity.</LINE>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>&#8220;Thus merely with the garment of a Grace</LINE>
<LINE>The naked and concealed fiend he cover&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>That th&#8217; unexperient gave the tempter place,</LINE>
<LINE>Which like a cherubin above them hover&#8217;d.</LINE>
<LINE>Who, young and simple, would not be so lover&#8217;d?</LINE>
<LINE>Ay me, I fell, and yet do question make</LINE>
<LINE>What I should do again for such a sake.</LINE>
</STANZA>

<STANZA>
<LINE>&#8220;O, that infected moisture of his eye,</LINE>
<LINE>O, that false fire which in his cheek so glowed,</LINE>
<LINE>O, that forc&#8217;d thunder from his heart did fly,</LINE>
<LINE>O, that sad breath his spungy lungs bestowed,</LINE>
<LINE>O, all that borrowed motion seeming owed,</LINE>
<LINE>Would yet again betray the fore-betray&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>And new pervert a reconciled maid!&#8221;</LINE>
</STANZA>
