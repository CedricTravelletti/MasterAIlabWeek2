<title short="A Lover&#8217;s Complaint">A Lover&#8217;s Complaint</title>
<playwright>William Shakespeare</playwright>

<poembody>

<stanza>
<line>From off a hill whose concave womb reworded</line>
<line>A plaintful story from a sist&#8217;ring vale,</line>
<line>My spirits t&#8217; attend this double voice accorded,</line>
<line>And down I laid to list the sad-tun&#8217;d tale,</line>
<line>Ere long espied a fickle maid full pale</line>
<line>Tearing of papers, breaking rings a-twain,</line>
<line>Storming her world with sorrow&#8217;s wind and rain.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Upon her head a platted hive of straw,</line>
<line>Which fortified her visage from the sun,</line>
<line>Whereon the thought might think sometime it saw</line>
<line>The carcass of a beauty spent and done.</line>
<line>Time had not scythed all that youth begun,</line>
<line>Nor youth all quit, but spite of heaven&#8217;s fell rage,</line>
<line>Some beauty peep&#8217;d through lettice of sear&#8217;d age.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Oft did she heave her napkin to her eyne,</line>
<line>Which on it had conceited characters,</line>
<line>Laund&#8217;ring the silken figures in the brine</line>
<line>That seasoned woe had pelleted in tears,</line>
<line>And often reading what contents it bears;</line>
<line>As often shriking undistinguish&#8217;d woe,</line>
<line>In clamors of all size, both high and low.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Sometimes her levell&#8217;d eyes their carriage ride,</line>
<line>As they did batt&#8217;ry to the spheres intend;</line>
<line>Sometime diverted their poor balls are tied</line>
<line>To th&#8217; orbed earth; sometimes they do extend</line>
<line>Their view right on; anon their gazes lend</line>
<line>To every place at once, and no where fix&#8217;d,</line>
<line>The mind and sight distractedly commix&#8217;d.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Her hair, nor loose nor tied in formal plat,</line>
<line>Proclaim&#8217;d in her a careless hand of pride;</line>
<line>For some untuck&#8217;d descended her sheav&#8217;d hat,</line>
<line>Hanging her pale and pined cheek beside;</line>
<line>Some in her threaden fillet still did bide,</line>
<line>And true to bondage would not break from thence,</line>
<line>Though slackly braided in loose negligence.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>A thousand favors from a maund she drew,</line>
<line>Of amber, crystal, and of beaded jet,</line>
<line>Which one by one she in a river threw,</line>
<line>Upon whose weeping margent she was set,</line>
<line>Like usury applying wet to wet,</line>
<line>Or monarch&#8217;s hands that lets not bounty fall</line>
<line>Where want cries some, but where excess begs all.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Of folded schedules had she many a one,</line>
<line>Which she perus&#8217;d, sigh&#8217;d, tore, and gave the flood,</line>
<line>Crack&#8217;d many a ring of posied gold and bone,</line>
<line>Bidding them find their sepulchres in mud,</line>
<line>Found yet more letters sadly penn&#8217;d in blood,</line>
<line>With sleided silk feat and affectedly</line>
<line>Enswath&#8217;d and seal&#8217;d to curious secrecy.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>These often bath&#8217;d she in her fluxive eyes,</line>
<line>And often kiss&#8217;d, and often gan to tear;</line>
<line>Cried, &#8220;O false blood, thou register of lies,</line>
<line>What unapproved witness dost thou bear!</line>
<line>Ink would have seem&#8217;d more black and damned here!&#8221;</line>
<line>This said, in top of rage the lines she rents,</line>
<line>Big discontent so breaking their contents.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>A reverend man that graz&#8217;d his cattle nigh,</line>
<line>Sometime a blusterer that the ruffle knew</line>
<line>Of court, of city, and had let go by</line>
<line>The swiftest hours, observed as they flew,</line>
<line>Towards this afflicted fancy fastly drew,</line>
<line>And privileg&#8217;d by age desires to know</line>
<line>In brief the grounds and motives of her woe.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>So slides he down upon his grained bat,</line>
<line>And comely distant sits he by her side,</line>
<line>When he again desires her, being sat,</line>
<line>Her grievance with his hearing to divide:</line>
<line>If that from him there may be aught applied</line>
<line>Which may her suffering ecstasy assuage,</line>
<line>&#8217;Tis promis&#8217;d in the charity of age.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>&#8220;Father,&#8221; she says, &#8220;though in me you behold</line>
<line>The injury of many a blasting hour,</line>
<line>Let it not tell your judgment I am old,</line>
<line>Not age, but sorrow, over me hath power;</line>
<line>I might as yet have been a spreading flower,</line>
<line>Fresh to myself, if I had self-applied</line>
<line>Love to myself, and to no love beside.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>&#8220;But woe is me, too early I attended</line>
<line>A youthful suitâ€”it was to gain my grace;</line>
<line>O, one by nature&#8217;s outwards so commended</line>
<line>That maidens&#8217; eyes stuck over all his face.</line>
<line>Love lack&#8217;d a dwelling and made him her place;</line>
<line>And when in his fair parts she did abide,</line>
<line>She was new lodg&#8217;d and newly deified.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>&#8220;His browny locks did hang in crooked curls,</line>
<line>And every light occasion of the wind</line>
<line>Upon his lips their silken parcels hurls.</line>
<line>What&#8217;s sweet to do, to do will aptly find:</line>
<line>Each eye that saw him did enchant the mind,</line>
<line>For on his visage was in little drawn</line>
<line>What largeness thinks in Paradise was sawn.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>&#8220;Small show of man was yet upon his chin,</line>
<line>His phoenix down began but to appear</line>
<line>Like unshorn velvet on that termless skin,</line>
<line>Whose bare outbragg&#8217;d the web it seem&#8217;d to wear;</line>
<line>Yet showed his visage by that cost more dear,</line>
<line>And nice affections wavering stood in doubt</line>
<line>If best were as it was, or best without.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>&#8220;His qualities were beauteous as his form,</line>
<line>For maiden-tongu&#8217;d he was, and thereof free;</line>
<line>Yet if men mov&#8217;d him, was he such a storm</line>
<line>As oft &#8217;twixt May and April is to see,</line>
<line>When winds breathe sweet, unruly though they be.</line>
<line>His rudeness so with his authoriz&#8217;d youth</line>
<line>Did livery falseness in a pride of truth.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>&#8220;Well could he ride, and often men would say,</line>
<line>&#8216;That horse his mettle from his rider takes;</line>
<line>Proud of subjection, noble by the sway,</line>
<line>What rounds, what bounds, what course, what stop he makes!&#8217;</line>
<line>And controversy hence a question takes,</line>
<line>Whether the horse by him became his deed,</line>
<line>Or he his manage by th&#8217; well-doing steed.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>&#8220;But quickly on this side the verdict went:</line>
<line>His real habitude gave life and grace</line>
<line>To appertainings and to ornament,</line>
<line>Accomplish&#8217;d in himself, not in his case;</line>
<line>All aids, themselves made fairer by their place,</line>
<line>Came for additions, yet their purpos&#8217;d trim</line>
<line>Piec&#8217;d not his grace but were all grac&#8217;d by him.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>&#8220;So on the tip of his subduing tongue</line>
<line>All kind of arguments and question deep,</line>
<line>All replication prompt and reason strong,</line>
<line>For his advantage still did wake and sleep.</line>
<line>To make the weeper laugh, the laugher weep,</line>
<line>He had the dialect and different skill,</line>
<line>Catching all passions in his craft of will,</line>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>&#8220;That he did in the general bosom reign</line>
<line>Of young, of old, and sexes both enchanted,</line>
<line>To dwell with him in thoughts, or to remain</line>
<line>In personal duty, following where he haunted.</line>
<line>Consents bewitch&#8217;d, ere he desire, have granted,</line>
<line>And dialogu&#8217;d for him what he would say,</line>
<line>Ask&#8217;d their own wills and made their wills obey.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>&#8220;Many there were that did his picture get</line>
<line>To serve their eyes, and in it put their mind,</line>
<line>Like fools that in th&#8217; imagination set</line>
<line>The goodly objects which abroad they find</line>
<line>Of lands and mansions, theirs in thought assign&#8217;d,</line>
<line>And laboring in more pleasures to bestow them</line>
<line>Than the true gouty landlord which doth owe them.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>&#8220;So many have that never touch&#8217;d his hand</line>
<line>Sweetly suppos&#8217;d them mistress of his heart.</line>
<line>My woeful self that did in freedom stand,</line>
<line>And was my own fee-simple (not in part),</line>
<line>What with his art in youth and youth in art,</line>
<line>Threw my affections in his charmed power,</line>
<line>Reserv&#8217;d the stalk and gave him all my flower.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>&#8220;Yet did I not as some my equals did</line>
<line>Demand of him, nor being desired yielded;</line>
<line>Finding myself in honor so forbid,</line>
<line>With safest distance I mine honor shielded.</line>
<line>Experience for me many bulwarks builded</line>
<line>Of proofs new-bleeding which remain&#8217;d the foil</line>
<line>Of this false jewel, and his amorous spoil.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>&#8220;But ah, who ever shunn&#8217;d by precedent</line>
<line>The destin&#8217;d ill she must herself assay,</line>
<line>Or forc&#8217;d examples &#8217;gainst her own content</line>
<line>To put the by-past perils in her way?</line>
<line>Counsel may stop a while what will not stay;</line>
<line>For when we rage, advice is often seen</line>
<line>By blunting us to make our wits more keen.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>&#8220;Nor gives it satisfaction to our blood</line>
<line>That we must curb it upon others&#8217; proof,</line>
<line>To be forbod the sweets that seems so good</line>
<line>For fear of harms that preach in our behoof.</line>
<line>O appetite, from judgment stand aloof!</line>
<line>The one a palate hath that needs will taste,</line>
<line>Though Reason weep and cry, &#8216;It is thy last.&#8217;</line>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>&#8220;For further I could say this man&#8217;s untrue,</line>
<line>And knew the patterns of his foul beguiling,</line>
<line>Heard where his plants in others&#8217; orchards grew,</line>
<line>Saw how deceits were gilded in his smiling,</line>
<line>Knew vows were ever brokers to defiling,</line>
<line>Thought characters and words merely but art,</line>
<line>And bastards of his foul adulterate heart.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>&#8220;And long upon these terms I held my city,</line>
<line>Till thus he gan besiege me: &#8216;Gentle maid,</line>
<line>Have of my suffering youth some feeling pity</line>
<line>And be not of my holy vows afraid.</line>
<line>That&#8217;s to ye sworn to none was ever said,</line>
<line>For feasts of love I have been call&#8217;d unto,</line>
<line>Till now did ne&#8217;er invite nor never vow.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>&#8220;&#8216;All my offenses that abroad you see</line>
<line>Are errors of the blood, none of the mind;</line>
<line>Love made them not, with acture they may be,</line>
<line>Where neither party is nor true nor kind:</line>
<line>They sought their shame that so their shame did find,</line>
<line>And so much less of shame in me remains</line>
<line>By how much of me their reproach contains.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>&#8220;&#8216;Among the many that mine eyes have seen,</line>
<line>Not one whose flame my heart so much as warmed,</line>
<line>Or my affection put to th&#8217; smallest teen,</line>
<line>Or any of my leisures ever charmed.</line>
<line>Harm have I done to them but ne&#8217;er was harmed,</line>
<line>Kept hearts in liveries, but mine own was free,</line>
<line>And reign&#8217;d commanding in his monarchy.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>&#8220;&#8216;Look here what tributes wounded fancies sent me,</line>
<line>Of pallid pearls and rubies red as blood:</line>
<line>Figuring that they their passions likewise lent me</line>
<line>Of grief and blushes, aptly understood</line>
<line>In bloodless white and the encrimson&#8217;d mood,</line>
<line>Effects of terror and dear modesty,</line>
<line>Encamp&#8217;d in hearts but fighting outwardly.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>&#8220;&#8216;And lo behold these talents of their hair,</line>
<line>With twisted metal amorously impleach&#8217;d,</line>
<line>I have receiv&#8217;d from many a several fair,</line>
<line>Their kind acceptance weepingly beseech&#8217;d,</line>
<line>With th&#8217; annexions of fair gems enrich&#8217;d,</line>
<line>And deep-brain&#8217;d sonnets that did amplify</line>
<line>Each stone&#8217;s dear nature, worth, and quality.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>&#8220;&#8216;The diamond? Why, &#8217;twas beautiful and hard,</line>
<line>Whereto his invis&#8217;d properties did tend;</line>
<line>The deep-green em&#8217;rald, in whose fresh regard</line>
<line>Weak sights their sickly radiance do amend;</line>
<line>The heaven-hu&#8217;d sapphire and the opal blend</line>
<line>With objects manifold: each several stone,</line>
<line>With wit well blazon&#8217;d, smil&#8217;d or made some moan.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>&#8220;&#8216;Lo all these trophies of affections hot,</line>
<line>Of pensiv&#8217;d and subdu&#8217;d desires the tender,</line>
<line>Nature hath charg&#8217;d me that I hoard them not,</line>
<line>But yield them up where I myself must render:</line>
<line>That is to you, my origin and ender;</line>
<line>For these of force must your oblations be,</line>
<line>Since I their altar, you enpatron me.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>&#8220;&#8216;O then advance (of yours) that phraseless hand,</line>
<line>Whose white weighs down the airy scale of praise,</line>
<line>Take all these similes to your own command,</line>
<line>Hallowed with sighs that burning lungs did raise;</line>
<line>What me, your minister, for you obeys,</line>
<line>Works under you, and to your audit comes</line>
<line>Their distract parcels in combined sums.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>&#8220;&#8216;Lo this device was sent me from a nun,</line>
<line>Or sister sanctified, of holiest note,</line>
<line>Which late her noble suit in court did shun,</line>
<line>Whose rarest havings made the blossoms dote,</line>
<line>For she was sought by spirits of richest coat,</line>
<line>But kept cold distance, and did thence remove</line>
<line>To spend her living in eternal love.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>&#8220;&#8216;But, O my sweet, what labor is&#8217;t to leave</line>
<line>The thing we have not, mast&#8217;ring what not strives,</line>
<line>Playing the place which did no form receive,</line>
<line>Playing patient sports in unconstrained gyves?</line>
<line>She that her fame so to herself contrives,</line>
<line>The scars of battle scapeth by the flight,</line>
<line>And makes her absence valiant, not her might.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>&#8220;&#8216;O, pardon me, in that my boast is true:</line>
<line>The accident which brought me to her eye</line>
<line>Upon the moment did her force subdue,</line>
<line>And now she would the caged cloister fly:</line>
<line>Religious love put out religion&#8217;s eye.</line>
<line>Not to be tempted would she be enur&#8217;d,</line>
<line>And now to tempt all liberty procur&#8217;d.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>&#8220;&#8216;How mighty then you are, O, hear me tell!</line>
<line>The broken bosoms that to me belong</line>
<line>Have emptied all their fountains in my well,</line>
<line>And mine I pour your ocean all among:</line>
<line>I strong o&#8217;er them, and you o&#8217;er me being strong,</line>
<line>Must for your victory us all congest,</line>
<line>As compound love to physic your cold breast.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>&#8220;&#8216;My parts had pow&#8217;r to charm a sacred nun,</line>
<line>Who disciplin&#8217;d, ay, dieted in grace,</line>
<line>Believ&#8217;d her eyes when they t&#8217; assail begun,</line>
<line>All vows and consecrations giving place.</line>
<line>O most potential love! Vow, bond, nor space</line>
<line>In thee hath neither sting, knot, nor confine,</line>
<line>For thou art all, and all things else are thine.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>&#8220;&#8216;When thou impressest, what are precepts worth</line>
<line>Of stale example? When thou wilt inflame,</line>
<line>How coldly those impediments stand forth</line>
<line>Of wealth, of filial fear, law, kindred, fame!</line>
<line>Love&#8217;s arms are peace, &#8217;gainst rule, &#8217;gainst sense, &#8217;gainst shame,</line>
<line>And sweetens, in the suff&#8217;ring pangs it bears,</line>
<line>The aloes of all forces, shocks, and fears.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>&#8220;&#8216;Now all these hearts that do on mine depend,</line>
<line>Feeling it break, with bleeding groans they pine,</line>
<line>And supplicant their sighs to you extend</line>
<line>To leave the batt&#8217;ry that you make &#8217;gainst mine,</line>
<line>Lending soft audience to my sweet design,</line>
<line>And credent soul to that strong-bonded oath</line>
<line>That shall prefer and undertake my troth.&#8217;</line>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>&#8220;This said, his wat&#8217;ry eyes he did dismount,</line>
<line>Whose sights till then were levell&#8217;d on my face,</line>
<line>Each cheek a river running from a fount</line>
<line>With brinish current downward flow&#8217;d apace:</line>
<line>O how the channel to the stream gave grace!</line>
<line>Who glaz&#8217;d with crystal gate the glowing roses</line>
<line>That flame through water which their hue encloses.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>&#8220;O father, what a hell of witchcraft lies</line>
<line>In the small orb of one particular tear!</line>
<line>But with the inundation of the eyes</line>
<line>What rocky heart to water will not wear?</line>
<line>What breast so cold that is not warmed here?</line>
<line>O cleft effect! Cold modesty, hot wrath,</line>
<line>Both fire from hence and chill extincture hath.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>&#8220;For lo his passion, but an art of craft,</line>
<line>Even there resolv&#8217;d my reason into tears,</line>
<line>There my white stole of chastity I daff&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Shook off my sober guards and civil fears;</line>
<line>Appear to him as he to me appears,</line>
<line>All melting, though our drops this diff&#8217;rence bore:</line>
<line>His poison&#8217;d me, and mine did him restore.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>&#8220;In him a plenitude of subtle matter,</line>
<line>Applied to cautels, all strange forms receives,</line>
<line>Of burning blushes, or of weeping water,</line>
<line>Or sounding paleness; and he takes and leaves,</line>
<line>In either&#8217;s aptness as it best deceives,</line>
<line>To blush at speeches rank, to weep at woes,</line>
<line>Or to turn white and sound at tragic shows;</line>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>&#8220;That not a heart which in his level came</line>
<line>Could scape the hail of his all-hurting aim,</line>
<line>Showing fair nature is both kind and tame;</line>
<line>And veil&#8217;d in them did win whom he would maim.</line>
<line>Against the thing he sought he would exclaim:</line>
<line>When he most burnt in heart-wish&#8217;d luxury,</line>
<line>He preach&#8217;d pure maid, and prais&#8217;d cold chastity.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>&#8220;Thus merely with the garment of a Grace</line>
<line>The naked and concealed fiend he cover&#8217;d,</line>
<line>That th&#8217; unexperient gave the tempter place,</line>
<line>Which like a cherubin above them hover&#8217;d.</line>
<line>Who, young and simple, would not be so lover&#8217;d?</line>
<line>Ay me, I fell, and yet do question make</line>
<line>What I should do again for such a sake.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>&#8220;O, that infected moisture of his eye,</line>
<line>O, that false fire which in his cheek so glowed,</line>
<line>O, that forc&#8217;d thunder from his heart did fly,</line>
<line>O, that sad breath his spungy lungs bestowed,</line>
<line>O, all that borrowed motion seeming owed,</line>
<line>Would yet again betray the fore-betray&#8217;d,</line>
<line>And new pervert a reconciled maid!&#8221;</line>
</stanza>
