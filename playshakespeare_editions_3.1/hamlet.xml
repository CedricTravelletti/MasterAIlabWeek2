<title short="Hamlet">The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark</title>
<playwright>William Shakespeare</playwright>

<personae playtitle="Hamlet">

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="KING.">Claudius, King of Denmark</persname>
<persdescription>Claudius is Old Hamlet&#8217;s brother, uncle to Hamlet, and the present King of Denmark. He murdered the latter out of love or lust for Gertrude and the crown. Where his brother was a warrior, Claudius prefers diplomacy to resolve international situations, just as he prefers poison to the sword. He is voluble and his language seductive and convincing. He also knows how to delegate, whether it be having Norway restrain Fortinbras, England execute Hamlet, or Laertes murder the prince when England fails. He and his chief minister spy a great deal, and his personal guards are mercenaries. His conscience is guilt-stricken by his brother&#8217;s murder, but he cannot bring himself to genuine repentance due to his unwillingness to give up all the things it brought him. He drinks a great deal and engages in many public displays of affection with Gertrude. He is not over-loved by the people, for fear of whom he dare not publically move against Hamlet, and who are easily roused to rebellion by Laertes. He pities Ophelia and likes Polonius, and is besotted with his queen. He orders that Ophelia be buried with ceremony instead of as a suicide. Though at first convinced of Hamlet&#8217;s madness, he is soon suspicious of the young man, realizes that the prince is somehow aware of his guilt, and begins to plot his death.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="GHOST.">Ghost of Hamlet&#8217;s Father</persname>
<persdescription>The Ghost of Old Hamlet haunts the castle of Elsinore. Having been murdered by his brother, he wanders the night, waiting for a chance to speak with his son. As he was unable to confess to his sins before death, he lives in Purgatory during the day. He charges Hamlet to revenge his murder, and when the prince takes too long about it reappears to spur him on. In life, he was an excellent warrior. A physically impressive specimen in life, he is very pale, bearded, his hair graying, and wears the armor he was wearing at his greatest victory, carrying a truncheon. He is at times suspected of being an evil spirit who has taken on Old Hamlet&#8217;s shape to wreak havoc on Denmark.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="female">
<persname short="OPH.">Ophelia</persname>
<persdescription>Ophelia is Polonius&#8217;s daughter. In love with Hamlet, she is obedient to her father and listens to her brother, though she is spirited enough to accuse him of potential hypocrisy. She obeys Polonius&#8217;s order to refuse to receive any more mail from Hamlet and not to see him, and turns over to her father what letters she does receive. She truly believes in Hamlet&#8217;s love, and though she agrees to trick him when commanded to by Claudius and Polonius, she is devastated when Hamlet turns on her, and believes in his madness. Nevertheless, she is able to banter somewhat with him at the play. Her father&#8217;s death at Hamlet&#8217;s hand drives her mad, in which state she undoes her hair and sings songs while accompanying herself on a lute. Her ravings touch on her father and her betrayal by Hamlet. Playing with flowers, she falls into the river and drowns, though whether this was intentional or not is uncertain.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="female">
<persname short="QUEEN.">Getrude, Queen of Denmark</persname>
<persdescription>Gertrude is the widow of Old Hamlet and the present wife of Claudius, Hamlet&#8217;s mother, and the Queen. She is not a native Dane. She married her brother-in-law quickly after her husband&#8217;s death, but has mostly repressed whatever feelings of guilt she has for doing so. She loves her son deeply, insisting on keeping him by her, though she is not as well-aware of his friendships as she thinks. Like Hamlet, she finds Polonius&#8217;s orotund speeches tedious. She is convinced that Hamlet is mad, and hopes to cure him, but can find no way to do so. Despite what Hamlet considers her great age (she is at least 44), she still enjoys the physical pleasures of marriage. She is brave, willing to physically restrain Laertes from attacking Claudius, but cannot fight back against Hamlet&#8217;s verbal assaults. She does not at first know Ophelia, and is frightened of her madness, but is devastated by her death, since she had hoped the girl might marry Hamlet once she heard of her son&#8217;s love for her. She does not think much of her subjects, and worries that Ophelia&#8217;s madness may make them suspicious. She recognizes that she has been poisoned by her last drink.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="FORT.">Fortinbras</persname>
<persdescription>Fortinbras is the Prince of Norway, a warlike young man with energy to spend. He intends to revenge his father, Old Fortinbras, who was killed in a duel with Old Hamlet and thereby lost some Norwegian lands to Denmark. Restrained from doing so by his uncle the king of Norway, he invades Poland instead, to capture a useless little plot of land. This greatly impresses Hamlet. On his return, he passes through Denmark, and happens to arrive just as everyone dies. Since the entire royal family of Denmark is dead, he claims the throne on the basis of some old connection, Hamlet having already spoken in his favor.</persdescription>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="FRAN.">Francisco</persname>
<persdescription>Francisco is a guard at Elsinore. He is slightly depressed, or at least unhappy about having to work cold nights.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="BAR.">Barnardo</persname>
<persaliases>
	<persname short="BOTH MAR. AND BAR.">Both Barnardo and Marcellus</persname>
	<persname short="HOR., MAR. AND BAR.">Horatio, Marcellus, and Barnardo</persname>
</persaliases>
<persdescription>Barnardo is a guard at Elsinore, charged with the midnight round. On two separate nights he has seen the ghost of Old Hamlet while standing guard. With Marcellus, he tells the tale to the skeptical Horatio; when the latter witnesses the apparition, he cannot resist a little dig at the scholar&#8217;s disbelief. He suspects that the ghost appears in warning about the possible coming war.</persdescription>

<persaliases>
	<persname short="BOTH MAR. AND BAR.">Both Barnardo and Marcellus</persname>
	<persname short="HOR., MAR. AND BAR.">Horatio, Marcellus, and Barnardo</persname>
</persaliases>
<persdescription>Marcellus is a guard at Elsinore, Barnardo&#8217;s companion on the midnight round. With him, he witnesses the apparition of the ghost. He convinces Horatio to join them for the watch on the third night. He knows more about ghosts than Barnardo, and known to Hamlet. He risks physically restraining the latter from following the ghost, but later swears himself to silence over the whole matter of the haunting. He is concerned about the warlike preparations going on in Denmark, and feels that something is wrong in the world.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="HOR.">Horatio</persname>
<persaliases>
	<persname short="HOR., MAR. AND BAR.">Horatio, Marcellus, and Barnardo</persname>
</persaliases>
<persdescription>Horatio is a friend of Hamlet&#8217;s, a fellow student at Wittenberg University. He is well-known enough in Elsinore for Marcellus and Barnardo to go to him for advice about the ghost they have seen. He is both learned and skeptical, not entirely willing to believe in every legend about the supernatural but knowing the habitual reasons why ghosts return from the grave. Though Hamlet has not seen him since he came from Wittenberg for Old Hamlet&#8217;s funeral, he soon becomes the prince&#8217;s one confidant. He is cautious about the ghost, afraid of its intentions, but accepts Hamlet&#8217;s vouching of its good faith. He does not give in much to emotion. He watches Claudius throughout the performance of the play and is convinced of his guilt. He is the first witness of Ophelia&#8217;s madness and convinces Gertrude to accept to see her. He goes to greet Hamlet on his secret return to Denmark. Hamlet considers him his best friend; he contemplates suicide at the catastrophic outcome of the duel, though insisting that he does so in a stoical manner rather than out of passion. Hamlet convinces him to live so as to tell the world the story, which he will do.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="POL.">Polonius</persname>
<persdescription>Polonius is Claudius&#8217;s long-bearded chief counselor. An old and respected man, he is opinionated, never uses one word when ten will do, speaks as a minor literary critic, is occasionally forgetful, and enjoys reminiscing about his days at university, where he took part in amateur dramatics and had a taste for the ladies. He is careful not to appear ambitious, and considers his daughter too lowly a bride for a prince. He expects full obedience from his daughter, and offers wise moral precepts to his son, while thinking nothing of having him spied on and using Ophelia as bait for Hamlet. He spies a great deal on everybody, and insists that matters of state come before more private ones, even the madness of the heir to the throne.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="HAM.">Hamlet</persname>
<persdescription>Hamlet is the Prince of Denmark. Devastated by his father&#8217;s death, he had nevertheless hoped to succeed him, only to see his uncle Claudius both be chosen as king and marry his mother. This does nothing for his depression. Beloved by the people, he is thirty years old, a superlative fencer, a student at the university in Wittenberg, introspective, and suspicious. He is in love with Ophelia, or at least has been courting her. He keeps on his mourning clothes despite the royal wedding and wishes to return to Wittenberg to escape this new Denmark. Virtually suicidal, he is roused to action by the news that his father&#8217;s ghost has been seen, though he is skeptical enough to double-check the claims of the ones who have seen it. This lack of concern for his life is strong enough, however, that he does not care what danger the ghost may lead him to. The ghost&#8217;s revelation that he was murdered by Claudius gives Hamlet a reason for his hatred of his uncle. He decides to mimic madness to avert suspicion, and may at times actually slip into genuine madness. He uses his madness as a license to speak his genuine feeling about Polonius. Highly intelligent, he catches on to Rosencrantz and Guildenstern&#8217;s mission within a few sentences, and runs rings around their attempts to diagnose him. He has a great love of theatre, knowing the players personally and having heard them perform plays almost never performed, as well as knowing exactly what play exists to trap Claudius, writing lines to be added to it, and having a great deal of advice on how to act for the professionals. His loathing of his uncle is visceral, and he also spits out detestation for himself, women, makeup, and his traitorous friends. He is disgusted at the idea of his mother having sex, much less enjoying it, believing that middle-aged ladies do not feel desire. His hatred for Claudius leads him to forgo an excellent opportunity to kill him, out of concern that his uncle might end up in heaven instead of hell. Discovering that Claudius intended him to be executed as soon as he set foot in England, he has no compunction about having this done to Rosencrantz and Guildenstern instead. This new ruthlessness follows him when he returns to Denmark after having been captured by pirates. His conscience clear, he is determined to bring the matter to an end. Distressed by Ophelia&#8217;s death, he does not take his first opportunity. He accepts the duel with Laertes with a sense of fatalism, though claiming that all the injuries he did to his opponent were done in madness. Hearing that he has been poisoned, he finally kills Claudius, refuses to give a valedictory speech, prevents Horatio from killing himself and asking him to tell the whole story, and naming Fortinbras as the best successor to the throne of Denmark.</persdescription>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="OSR.">Osric</persname>
<persdescription>Osric is a young courtier at Claudius&#8217;s court. Rich and little more, he is affected in his speech and manner, removing his hat in Hamlet&#8217;s presence without ceasing to flourish it about. He is enough of a fencer to be the judge of the bout between Hamlet and Laertes.</persdescription>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="GUIL.">Guildenstern</persname>
<persaliases>
	<persname short="BOTH ROS. AND GUIL.">Both Rosencrantz and Guildenstern</persname>
</persaliases>
<persdescription>Guildenstern is a childhood friend of Hamlet&#8217;s, inseparable from Rosencrantz. Quieter than the latter, he adds to his pronouncements, and is honest enough to admit that he and Rosencrantz were sent for. He makes certain that he is not overshadowed by his companion, and is willing to tell Hamlet to make sense. He is slightly less of a crawler than is Rosencrantz, and does not know how to play the recorder. He accompanies Hamlet on his ship to England, continues after Hamlet is captured by pirates, and has his head chopped off on arrival.</persdescription>

	<persname short="BOTH ROS. AND GUIL.">Both Rosencrantz and Guildenstern</persname>
</persaliases>
<persdescription>Rosencrantz is a childhood friend of Hamlet&#8217;s, inseparable from Guildenstern. He knows more about the theatre than does the latter. Called to court by Claudius to spy on Hamlet, both are incompetent enough that he realizes this after a few sentences between them. Rosencrantz is a crawler before Claudius, and somewhat overdoes his compliments. He accompanies Hamlet on his ship to England, continues after Hamlet is captured by pirates, and has his head chopped off on arrival.</persdescription>

<persdescription>Cornelius is a courtier at Claudius&#8217;s court. He is sent with Voltemand to Norway, to inform that country&#8217;s king of how his nephew Fortinbras is threatening Denmark, and to convince him to restrain the young man. His mission is highly successful.</persdescription>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="LAER.">Laertes</persname>
<persdescription>Laertes is Polonius&#8217;s son, who prefers life in Paris to Elsinore. He has some of his father&#8217;s moral sententiousness, but both his sister and father suspect that he may not be as upright as he puts out. His father&#8217;s death affects him so much that he returns enraged from Paris and raises a rebellion against Claudius. The sight of his mad sister shifts him from rage to grief and allows Claudius to convince him of Hamlet&#8217;s guilt. He is willing to do anything for revenge, no matter how treacherous or how dangerous to his soul. He is an excellent fencer.</persdescription>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="P. KING.">First Player (Player King)</persname>
<persdescription>The First Player has, with his company, known Hamlet for some time. He remembers a speech from a play that was never acted, and recites it most affectingly, to the extent of having tears in his eyes. He is willing to insert some new lines into the play Hamlet calls for them to perform. He plays the King in that performance.</persdescription>

<scenepersonae>(Barnardo, Francisco, Horatio, Marcellus, Ghost)</scenepersonae>
<scenedescription>For two nights Bernardo and Marcellus have seen a ghost in the form of the late King appear on the battlements. They have called on the scholar Horatio to join them on the third night, in the hopes he will know what to do. Horatio is skeptical, as he does not believe in ghosts, but he is shaken when the ghost appears just as predicted. They discuss the preparations for war occupying the Danish court, and Horatio explains that young Fortinbras of Norway is threatening to take back the lands that his father lost to old Hamlet, the dead King whose ghost they have seen. The ghost reappears, and Horatio tries to get it to speak, suggesting every explanation for its appearance that he can think of; but the ghost remains silent and vanishes as the morning rises. The three agree to tell young Hamlet, the dead man&#8217;s son, about the event.</scenedescription>

<scenelocation>Elsinore. A room of state in the castle.</scenelocation>
<scenepersonae>(Claudius, Gertrude, Polonius, Laertes, Hamlet, Voltemand, Cornelius, Horatio, Marcellus, Barnardo)</scenepersonae>
<scenedescription>King Claudius explains that he has married his brother&#8217;s widow; he then moves on to matters of state and sends Voltemand and Cornelius to Fortinbras&#8217;s uncle Norway, detailing the young man&#8217;s movements and warning Norway to restrain him. Claudius then gives Laertes permission to return to Parism since Polonius has agreed. Claudius then turns to his stepson Hamlet&#8217;s endless mourning for his father. Gertrude attempts to persuade her son to cheer up, but he is unresponsive. At Claudius and Gertrude&#8217;s urging, he accepts not to return to university in Wittenberg. Left alone, Hamlet laments his mother&#8217;s remarriage, especially as it came within three months of his father&#8217;s death; he is disgusted that she married her brother-in-law. Horatio and the soldiers appear and tell him their story; he is disbelieving and tests them, but quickly grows suspicious, and agrees to watch with them that night.</scenedescription>

<scenedescription>Hamlet refuses to go any further. The ghost finally speaks, confirming that it is indeed Old Hamlet&#8217;s spirit, which has been condemned to tortures in the afterlife until its sins are washed away. The ghost reveals the Old Hamlet was murdered, and by Claudius – who now has his crown and wife. It charges Hamlet to revenge the crime, though insisting that he not harm Gertrude. As the morning arrives, the ghost vanishes. Horatio and Marcellus arrive and plead with hamlet to tell them what the ghost said, but the prince, in a wild mood, refuses. Seconded by the ghost&#8217;s voice, he makes them swear on his sword never to speak of the apparition again, and tells them that he may decide to act mad in the future, and that they are in no way to let anyone suspect it might not be genuine.</scenedescription>

<scenetitle>Scene 2</scenetitle>
<scenelocation>Elsinore. A room in Elsinore castle.</scenelocation>
<scenepersonae>(King, Queen, Hamlet, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, Polonius, Voltemand, Cornelius, Attendants, Players)</scenepersonae>
<scenedescription>Claudius and Gertrude welcome Hamlet&#8217;s childhood friends Guildenstern and Rosencrantz to the court, asking them to find out what lies behind Hamlet&#8217;s strange behavior. The crawling young men agree. The ambassadors from Norway return, reporting that Fortinbras has been pulled over the coals by his uncle and ordered to attack the Polacks instead. Norway seeks free passage for its army through Denmark. Polonius explains to the King and Queen about the relationship between his daughter and Hamlet, quoting from a letter the prince sent the girl, and expounds his belief that it is this unrequited love that has driven Hamlet mad. He suggests arranging a meeting between the two young people and spying on them with Claudius. Hamlet enters reading, and Polonius attempts to make him speak sense; the old man realizes that Hamlet&#8217;s talk is not entirely senseless. Rosencrantz and Guildernstern accost Hamlet, who is delighted to see them, but he soon realizes that they must have been summoned by the King and Queen, and is disappointed that they do not admit it outright. They two are confounded and do not know how to react, but mention that a troupe of travelling players will soon arrive at Elsinore. Hamlet, who loves theatre, is thrilled. Polonius announces the actors&#8217; arrival. Hamlet welcomes them all by name, as he knows them well. He is so excited that he begins reciting one of his favorite speeches, asking the lead player to complete it. The tale, of a son avenging his father, moves him greatly. He arranges to have a play performed the next day and to add a few lines to it. Alone, he rails against his own procrastination in exacting revenge. Wanting to be certain that the ghost&#8217;s story is true, he decides that the players will act a play showing a very similar murder the next day; if Claudius shows signs of guilt, Hamlet will be convinced the ghost spoke true.</scenedescription>

I remember one said there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savory, nor no matter in the phrase that might indict the author of affection, but call&#8217;d it an honest method, as wholesome as sweet, and by very much more handsome than fine. One speech in&#8217;t I chiefly lov&#8217;d, &#8217;twas Aeneas&#8217; tale to Dido, and thereabout of it especially when he speaks of Priam&#8217;s slaughter.

<line form="verse">Repugnant to command. Unequal match&#8217;d,</line>
<line form="verse">Pyrrhus at Priam drives, in rage strikes wide,</line>
<line form="verse">But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword</line>
<line form="verse">Th&#8217; unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,</line>
<line form="verse">Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top</line>
<line form="verse">Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash</line>
<line form="verse">Takes prisoner Pyrrhus&#8217; ear; for lo his sword,</line>

<scenepersonae>(King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, Lords, Hamlet)</scenepersonae>
<scenedescription>Guildenstern and Rosencrantz report on their activity to the King and Queen and Polonius, but cannot give them an explanation for his behavior. The King and Polonius have sent for Hamlet, and they hide behind a tapestry while leaving Ophelia supposedly reading a prayer-book, to observe the encounter. The King is hiding an uneasy conscience. Hamlet enters, thinking on death, suicide and the afterlife. He fears that conscience turns people into cowards. Seeing Ophelia, he approaches her. She tries to give him back all the letters and gifts he sent her. He turns cold and begins questioning her honesty, and soon whips himself into a rage, insulting her dreadfully, accusing her of hypocrisy, and telling her that he never loved her. He rails against marriage. Ophelia is distraught. Polonius still thinks that love is at the root of his behavior, but Claudies spies something darker, and resolves to send him to England as an ambassador to collect tribute, in the hopes that the change will do him good. Polonius suggests that Hamlet should have a talk with his mother, in the hopes that he may tell her what is troubling; Polonius offers to spy on that meeting, too.</scenedescription>

<line form="verse">For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,</line>
<line form="verse">When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,</line>

<scenelocation>Elsinore. A hall in Elsinore castle.</scenelocation>
<scenepersonae>(Hamlet, Players, Polonius, Guildenstern, Rosencrantz, Horatio, King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, Lords, Guard, Prologue, Lucianus)</scenepersonae>
<scenedescription>As the players prepare for the play, Hamlet gives them advice. He explains the plan behind his choice of play to Horatio, and asks him to keep an eye on the King as well. The court enters for the performance. Hamlet refuses to sit by his mother, preferring to sit by Ophelia and speak lewdly to her. The play opens with a dumb show with a King and Queen protesting love before he settles down for a nap and is poisoned in his sleep, his murderer winning the Queen&#8217;s love with gifts. The play itself follows the same plot. When it reaches the poisoning, which mirrors the one the ghost spoke of, Claudius rises and leaves, bringing an end to the production. Hamlet and Horatio are convinced that the ghost&#8217;s story of murder is true and that Claudius is guilty. Guildenstern and Rosencrantz brings Hamlet an order to go visit his mother, and ask him once again to tell them what the matter is, but he refuses, accusing them of attempting to play him like an instrument. Polonius appears, reinforcing the summons to the Queen. Hamlet promises he will go. He realizes that he is in a bloodthirsty mood, and forces himself to promise that he will not use any violence against his mother.</scenedescription>

<speaker>HAM.</speaker>
<line form="prose">Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounc&#8217;d it to you,
trippingly on the tongue, but if you mouth it, as many of our players
do, I had as lief the town-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air
too much with your hand, thus, but use all gently, for in the very
torrent, tempest, and, as I may say, whirlwind of your passion, you
must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it
offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a
passion to totters, to very rags, to spleet the ears of the
groundlings, who for the most part are capable of nothing but
inexplicable dumb shows and noise. I would have such a fellow whipt for
 o&#8217;erdoing Termagant, it out-Herods Herod, pray you avoid it.</line>

<line form="prose">Be not too tame neither, but let your own discretion be your
tutor. Suit the action to the word, the word to the action, with this
special observance, that you o&#8217;erstep not the modesty of nature: for
any thing so o&#8217;erdone is from the purpose of playing, whose end, both
at the first and now, was and is, to hold as &#8217;twere the mirror up
to nature: to show virtue her feature, scorn her own image, and the
very age and body of the time his form and pressure. Now this overdone,
or come tardy off, though it makes the unskillful laugh, cannot but
make the judicious grieve; the censure of which one must in your
allowance o&#8217;erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be players that
I have seen play&#8212;and heard others praise, and that highly&#8212;not to
speak it profanely, that, neither having th&#8217; accent of Christians nor
the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so strutted and bellow&#8217;d

no more than is set down for them, for there be of them that will
themselves laugh to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh
too, though in the mean time some necessary question of the play be
then to be consider&#8217;d. That&#8217;s villainous, and shows a most pitiful

<scenedescription>Claudius has prepared Hamlet&#8217;s commission for England, and instructs Rosencrantz and Guildenstern to leave with him and keep an eye on him. Polonius passes by and tells Claudius that he is on his way to hide in the Queen&#8217;s closet to spy on her meeting with Hamlet. Alone, Claudius reflects on his crime, and is stricken with remorse. He attempts to pray, but cannot bring himself to ask forgiveness while he still enjoys everything he gained by committing the murder. Hamlet, passing by, sees him at prayer and almost kills him, but reflects that if killed at prayer, Claudius will go to heaven, so he decides to wait until Claudius is doing something sinful, in the hopes of sending him straight to hell. Claudius realizes that his prayers are going nowhere – ironically, Hamlet&#8217;s caution was useless.</scenedescription>

He is so wild that she cries out in fear; Polonius calls for help, and Hamlet, thinking it may be the King, kills the man behind the tapestry. He gives Polonius a cold farewell before returning to his attack on the Queen, asking her how she could marry Claudius after having been Old Hamlet&#8217;s wife, and accuses his uncle of murder. Gertrude tries to get him to stop, but is unsuccessful. The ghost enters to stop Hamlet from harming his mother and to tell him to get a move on with the revenge business. Gertrude cannot see the ghost, and is convinced that Hamlet is truly insane. He begs her to repent and to stop sleeping with Claudius. They recall that he must go to England.

<scenepersonae>(King, Attendants, Rosencrantz, Hamlet, Guildenstern)</scenepersonae>
<scenedescription>Claudius considers that he cannot punish Hamlet too severely due to his popularity with the commoners. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern admit their inability to get Hamlet to tell where Polonius&#8217;s body is. The prince refuses to answer the question when Claudius asks it to, instead pointing out how everybody, even emperors, will be food for worms one day. Finally he tells them that they will be able to find Polonius by smell in the lobby if they wait long enough. Claudius orders Hamlet to leave for England more quickly than planned. Hamlet mockingly bids him farewell as his mother, seeing as man and wife are one flesh. The King orders Rosencrantz and Guildenstern to see to it that Hamlet sails immediately. He reveals that the letters being carried to England order the English to execute the prince.</scenedescription>

<scenedescription>Gertrude tries to avoid seeing the distracted Ophelia, but is finally persuaded to let her in. She enters, speaking senselessly, singing snatches of old songs relating to her abandonment and her father&#8217;s death. Claudius witnesses this, and, moved, orders that a close watch be kept on her. He reveals that Laertes has returned to Denmark and that the people are muttering because of Polonius&#8217;s death. Suddenly there is a noise, and the monarchs are told that a mob led by Laertes is attacking the palace, and that the commoners are yelling that Laertes should be King. Laertes breaks in, demanding to know where his father is. The queen tries to protect the Queen, but she is pushed away by Claudius, who faces Laertes fearlessly. Laertes swears he will have vengeance whatever the consequences, and the King approves him. Ophelia enters, still singing. Laertes&#8217;s rage turns to grief at the sight of his sister having lost her wits. Claudius insists on his own grief, and begs Laertes to listen to him. He offers to explain everything that has happened, and to offer any redress Laertes might call for.</scenedescription>

On the instant they got clear of our ship, so I alone became their prisoner. They have dealt with me like thieves of mercy, but they knew what they did: I am to do a good turn for them. Let the King have the letters I have sent, and repair thou to me with as much speed as thou wouldest fly death. I have words to speak in thine ear will make thee dumb, yet are they much too light for the bore of the matter. These good fellows will bring thee where I am.

<scenedescription>Claudius has convinced Laertes that Hamlet is entirely to blame, and explains that he could not punish the prince because of Gertrude&#8217;s love for him, as well as the esteem of the populace. He proposes that Laertes undertake a private revenge, serving them both. Learning that Hamlet has returned, they come up with a plan based on Hamlet&#8217;s pride in his fencing abilities and Laertes&#8217;s fame in that exercise. They plan to arrange for a match between the two young men, and leave one of the sword points unprotected, so that Laertes can deal an actual wound. Laertes takes up the plot, explaining that he will poison the blade. To be absolutely certain of success, Claudius plans to have a poisoned drink nearby as well. Gertrude comes in with the news that Ophelia has drowned. Laertes leaves, refusing to cry; Claudius fears that he will have to start all over again with calming him.</scenedescription>

<scenedescription>Two gravediggers prepare a spot for Ophelia, though they think it wrong that a suspected suicide be given Christian burial. They suspect that it is only because she was upper-class that this is happening. Hamlet and Horatio come in as the gravedigger tosses out of bones and skulls from the grave as he makes room for the new arrival. Talking with the man, he discovers that he is holding the skull of his father&#8217;s jester Yorick, a great favorite of his when he was a child. He contemplates how everyone will end up looking no prettier than that skull. The King and Queen enter with the funeral procession and a cranky priest who is only given Ophelia burial rites because of the direct orders he has received; believing her a suicide he does not think she should have any. Hamlet realizes from what Laertes says that it is Ophelia who is being buried. The Queen reveals her wish that Ophelia might have married Hamlet. When Laertes jumps into the grave in grief, Hamlet springs up and then joins him, and the two fight over who loved her most. Claudius tells Horatio to keep Hamlet calm, and tells Laertes to remember that he&#8217;ll be able to get back at Hamlet soon.</scenedescription>

<scenetitle>Scene 2</scenetitle>
<scenelocation>Elsinore. A hall in Elsinore castle.</scenelocation>
<scenepersonae>(Hamlet, Horatio, Osric, Lord, King, Queen, Laertes, Fortinbras, English Ambassadors, Attendants)</scenepersonae>
<scenedescription>Hamlet tells Horatio how he rifled through Rosencrantz and Guildenstern&#8217;s luggage and found the orders for his execution, in which he substituted their names for his, with the result that if their ship has reached England, they are dead. He feels absolutely no remorse at this; he is much more regretful at having lost his temper at Laertes. The young courtier Osric comes in from the King to propose the duel with Laertes. Hamlet mocks him soundly, but accepts despite Horatio&#8217;s cautioning. Hamlet tells his friend that he is ready to die, and thus fears nothing. Before the whole court, Hamlet begs Laertes&#8217;s pardon, assuring him that any harms he may have done the other man were the fruits of madness. Laertes does not entirely accept the apology. They fight, and Hamlet lands the first two blows. The Queen drinks to his health from the poisoned cup, despite Claudius&#8217;s plea that she not drink. Laertes wounds Hamlet during what is supposed to be a pause in the fighting, and in the ensuing scuffle they exchange swords. They fight now in earnest, and Hamlet wounds Laertes. Gertrude dies. Realizing that he is caught in his own trap and about to die, Laertes confesses to poisoning the blade, and casts all the blame on Claudius. Hamlet stabs the King, and as the court calls out &#8216;Treason&#8217;, forces him to drink the dregs of the poisoned cup. Claudius dies. Laertes absolves Hamlet of his and Polonius&#8217;s deaths. Hamlet faces up to his own death. Horatio wishes to join him, but Hamlet prevents him from drinking from the poisoned cup, as he needs someone who knows to tell the story. He suggests that Fortinbras be chosen as the next king. The latter, passing by, salutes the ambassadors from England, who enter with him to confirm the deaths of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. The newcomers are aghast at the pile of bodies and ask for an explanation. As the royal family of Denmark has been wiped out, Fortinbras claims the throne. Horatio promises to tell the story, and Fortinbras orders that Hamlet be interred with military honors, as he is convinced that given a chance, Hamlet would have been a good soldier.</scenedescription>
