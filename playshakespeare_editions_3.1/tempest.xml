<LINE>Here, master; what cheer?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good; speak to th&#8217; mariners. Fall to&#8217;t, yarely, or we run ourselves aground. Bestir, bestir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Mariners.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BOATS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Heigh, my hearts! Cheerly, cheerly, my hearts! Yare, yare! Take in the topsail. Tend to th&#8217; master&#8217;s whistle.&#8212;Blow till thou burst thy wind, if room enough!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Alonso, Sebastian, Antonio, Ferdinando, Gonzalo, and others.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good boatswain, have care. Where&#8217;s the master? Play the men.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BOATS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I pray now keep below.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Where is the master, bos&#8217;n?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BOATS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do you not hear him? You mar our labor. Keep your cabins; you do assist the storm.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, good, be patient.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BOATS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>When the sea is. Hence! What cares these roarers for the name of king? To cabin! Silence! Trouble us not.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good, yet remember whom thou hast aboard.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BOATS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>None that I more love than myself. You are a councillor; if you can command these elements to silence, and work the peace of the present, we will not hand a rope more. Use your authority. If you cannot, give thanks you have liv&#8217;d so long, and make yourself ready in your cabin for the mischance of the hour, if it so hap.&#8212;Cheerly, good hearts!&#8212;Out of our way, I say.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have great comfort from this fellow. Methinks he hath no drowning mark upon him, his complexion is perfect gallows. Stand fast, good Fate, to his hanging, make the rope of his destiny our cable, for our own doth little advantage. If he be not born to be hang&#8217;d, our case is miserable.</LINE>

<LINE>Hang, cur! Hang, you whoreson, insolent noisemaker! We are less afraid to be drown&#8217;d than thou art.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll warrant him for drowning, though the ship were no stronger than a nutshell, and as leaky as an unstanch&#8217;d wench.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BOATS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Lay her a-hold, a-hold! Set her two courses off to sea again! Lay her off.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>GON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">He&#8217;ll be hang&#8217;d yet,</LINE>
<LINE>Though every drop of water swear against it,</LINE>
<LINE>And gape at wid&#8217;st to glut him.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>A confused noise within:</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>&#8220;Mercy on us!&#8221;&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>&#8220;We split, we split!&#8221;&#8212;&#8220;Farewell, my wife and children!&#8221;&#8212;</LINE>

<LINE>If by your art, my dearest father, you have</LINE>
<LINE>Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them.</LINE>
<LINE>The sky it seems would pour down stinking pitch,</LINE>
<LINE>But that the sea, mounting to th&#8217; welkin&#8217;s cheek,</LINE>
<LINE>Dashes the fire out. O! I have suffered</LINE>
<LINE>With those that I saw suffer. A brave vessel</LINE>
<LINE>(Who had, no doubt, some noble creature in her)</LINE>
<LINE>Dash&#8217;d all to pieces! O, the cry did knock</LINE>
<LINE>Against my very heart. Poor souls, they perish&#8217;d.</LINE>
<LINE>Had I been any God of power, I would</LINE>
<LINE>Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere</LINE>
<LINE>It should the good ship so have swallow&#8217;d, and</LINE>
<LINE>The fraughting souls within her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEAKER>PROS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="8">No harm:</LINE>
<LINE>I have done nothing, but in care of thee</LINE>
<LINE>(Of thee my dear one, thee my daughter), who</LINE>
<LINE>Art ignorant of what thou art, nought knowing</LINE>
<LINE>Of whence I am, nor that I am more better</LINE>
<LINE>Than Prospero, master of a full poor cell,</LINE>
<LINE>And thy no greater father.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MIR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">More to know</LINE>
<LINE>Did never meddle with my thoughts.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PROS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">&#8217;Tis time</LINE>
<LINE>I should inform thee farther. Lend thy hand,</LINE>
<LINE>And pluck my magic garment from me. So,</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Lays down his mantle.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Lie there, my art. Wipe thou thine eyes, have comfort.</LINE>
<LINE>The direful spectacle of the wrack, which touch&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>The very virtue of compassion in thee,</LINE>
<LINE>I have with such provision in mine art</LINE>
<LINE>So safely ordered that there is no soul&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>No, not so much perdition as an hair</LINE>
<LINE>Betid to any creature in the vessel</LINE>
<LINE>Which thou heardst cry, which thou saw&#8217;st sink. Sit down,</LINE>
<LINE>For thou must now know farther.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MIR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">You have often</LINE>
<LINE>Begun to tell me what I am, but stopp&#8217;d</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PROS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">The hour&#8217;s now come,</LINE>
<LINE>The very minute bids thee ope thine ear.</LINE>
<LINE>Obey, and be attentive. Canst thou remember</LINE>
<LINE>A time before we came unto this cell?</LINE>
<LINE>I do not think thou canst, for then thou wast not</LINE>
<LINE>Out three years old.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MIR.</SPEAKER>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MIR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">&#8217;Tis far off;</LINE>
<LINE>And rather like a dream than an assurance</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PROS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou hadst; and more, Miranda. But how is it</LINE>

<LINE>If thou rememb&#8217;rest aught ere thou cam&#8217;st here,</LINE>
<LINE>How thou cam&#8217;st here thou mayst.</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PROS.</SPEAKER>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MIR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">O the heavens,</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PROS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Both, both, my girl.</LINE>
<LINE>By foul play (as thou say&#8217;st) were we heav&#8217;d thence,</LINE>

<LINE>Be so perfidious!&#8212;he whom next thyself</LINE>
<LINE>Of all the world I lov&#8217;d, and to him put</LINE>
<LINE>The manage of my state, as at that time</LINE>
<LINE>Through all the signories it was the first,</LINE>
<LINE>And Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed</LINE>
<LINE>In dignity, and for the liberal arts</LINE>
<LINE>Without a parallel; those being all my study,</LINE>
<LINE>The government I cast upon my brother,</LINE>
<LINE>And to my state grew stranger, being transported</LINE>
<LINE>And rapt in secret studies. Thy false uncle&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Dost thou attend me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MIR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Sir, most heedfully.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PROS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Being once perfected how to grant suits,</LINE>
<LINE>How to deny them, who t&#8217; advance, and who</LINE>

<LINE>Awak&#8217;d an evil nature, and my trust,</LINE>
<LINE>Like a good parent, did beget of him</LINE>
<LINE>A falsehood in its contrary, as great</LINE>
<LINE>As my trust was, which had indeed no limit,</LINE>
<LINE>A confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded,</LINE>
<LINE>Not only with what my revenue yielded,</LINE>
<LINE>But what my power might else exact&#8212;like one</LINE>
<LINE>Who having into truth, by telling of it,</LINE>
<LINE>Made such a sinner of his memory</LINE>
<LINE>To credit his own lie&#8212;he did believe</LINE>
<LINE>He was indeed the Duke, out o&#8217; th&#8217; substitution,</LINE>
<LINE>And executing th&#8217; outward face of royalty</LINE>
<LINE>With all prerogative. Hence his ambition growing&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Dost thou hear?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>He thinks me now incapable; confederates</LINE>
<LINE>(So dry he was for sway) wi&#8217; th&#8217; King of Naples</LINE>
<LINE>To give him annual tribute, do him homage,</LINE>
<LINE>Subject his coronet to his crown, and bend</LINE>
<LINE>The dukedom yet unbow&#8217;d (alas, poor Milan!)</LINE>
<LINE>To most ignoble stooping.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>PROS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">Now the condition.</LINE>
<LINE>This King of Naples, being an enemy</LINE>
<LINE>To me inveterate, hearkens my brother&#8217;s suit,</LINE>
<LINE>Which was, that he in lieu o&#8217; th&#8217; premises,</LINE>
<LINE>Of homage, and I know not how much tribute,</LINE>
<LINE>Should presently extirpate me and mine</LINE>
<LINE>Out of the dukedom, and confer fair Milan</LINE>
<LINE>With all the honors on my brother; whereon,</LINE>
<LINE>A treacherous army levied, one midnight</LINE>
<LINE>Fated to th&#8217; purpose, did Antonio open</LINE>
<LINE>The gates of Milan, and i&#8217; th&#8217; dead of darkness</LINE>
<LINE>The ministers for th&#8217; purpose hurried thence</LINE>
<LINE>Me and thy crying self.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MIR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Alack, for pity!</LINE>
<LINE>I, not rememb&#8217;ring how I cried out then,</LINE>
<LINE>Will cry it o&#8217;er again. It is a hint</LINE>
<LINE>That wrings mine eyes to&#8217;t.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PROS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Hear a little further,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PROS.</SPEAKER>

<LINE>So dear the love my people bore me; nor set</LINE>
<LINE>A mark so bloody on the business; but</LINE>
<LINE>With colors fairer painted their foul ends.</LINE>
<LINE>In few, they hurried us aboard a bark,</LINE>
<LINE>Bore us some leagues to sea, where they prepared</LINE>
<LINE>A rotten carcass of a butt, not rigg&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor tackle, sail, nor mast, the very rats</LINE>
<LINE>Instinctively have quit it. There they hoist us,</LINE>
<LINE>To cry to th&#8217; sea, that roar&#8217;d to us; to sigh</LINE>
<LINE>To th&#8217; winds, whose pity, sighing back again,</LINE>
<LINE>Did us but loving wrong.</LINE>

<LINE>Out of his charity, who being then appointed</LINE>
<LINE>Master of this design, did give us, with</LINE>
<LINE>Rich garments, linens, stuffs, and necessaries,</LINE>
<LINE>Which since have steaded much; so of his gentleness,</LINE>

<LINE>By accident most strange, bountiful Fortune</LINE>
<LINE>(Now my dear lady) hath mine enemies</LINE>
<LINE>Brought to this shore; and by my prescience</LINE>
<LINE>I find my zenith doth depend upon</LINE>
<LINE>A most auspicious star, whose influence</LINE>
<LINE>If now I court not, but omit, my fortunes</LINE>
<LINE>Will ever after droop. Here cease more questions.</LINE>
<LINE>Thou art inclin&#8217;d to sleep; &#8217;tis a good dullness,</LINE>

<LINE>&#8220;Widow Dido,&#8221; said you? You make me study of that. She was of Carthage, not of Tunis.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SEB.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I think he will carry this island home in his pocket, and give it his son for an apple.</LINE>

<LINE>Sir, we were talking that our garments seem now as fresh as when we were at Tunis at the marriage of your daughter, who is now queen.</LINE>

<LINE>O, widow Dido? Ay, widow Dido.</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You cram these words into mine ears against</LINE>
<LINE>The stomach of my sense. Would I had never</LINE>

<LINE>My son is lost and (in my rate) she too,</LINE>
<LINE>Who is so far from Italy removed</LINE>
<LINE>I ne&#8217;er again shall see her. O thou mine heir</LINE>
<LINE>Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish</LINE>
<LINE>Hath made his meal on thee?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">Sir, he may live.</LINE>
<LINE>I saw him beat the surges under him,</LINE>
<LINE>And ride upon their backs. He trod the water,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose enmity he flung aside, and breasted</LINE>
<LINE>The surge most swoll&#8217;n that met him. His bold head</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Bove the contentious waves he kept, and oared</LINE>
<LINE>Himself with his good arms in lusty stroke</LINE>
<LINE>To th&#8217; shore, that o&#8217;er his wave-worn basis bowed,</LINE>
<LINE>As stooping to relieve him. I not doubt</LINE>
<LINE>He came alive to land.</LINE>

<LINE offset="5">No, no, he&#8217;s gone.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SEB.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, you may thank yourself for this great loss,</LINE>
<LINE>That would not bless our Europe with your daughter,</LINE>
<LINE>But rather loose her to an African,</LINE>
<LINE>Where she, at least, is banish&#8217;d from your eye,</LINE>

<LINE>By all of us, and the fair soul herself</LINE>
<LINE>Weigh&#8217;d between loathness and obedience, at</LINE>
<LINE>Which end o&#8217; th&#8217; beam should bow. We have lost your son,</LINE>

<LINE>Worthy Sebastian, O, what might&#8212;? No more&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>And yet methinks I see it in thy face,</LINE>
<LINE>What thou shouldst be. Th&#8217; occasion speaks thee, and</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SEB.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">I do, and surely</LINE>
<LINE>It is a sleepy language, and thou speak&#8217;st</LINE>
<LINE>Out of thy sleep. What is it thou didst say?</LINE>
<LINE>This is a strange repose, to be asleep</LINE>
<LINE>With eyes wide open&#8212;standing, speaking, moving&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>And yet so fast asleep.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>I am more serious than my custom; you</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE offset="7">O!</LINE>
<LINE>If you but knew how you the purpose cherish</LINE>
<LINE>Whiles thus you mock it! How, in stripping it,</LINE>
<LINE>You more invest it! Ebbing men, indeed,</LINE>
<LINE>Most often, do so near the bottom run</LINE>
<LINE>By their own fear or sloth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEAKER>SEB.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Prithee say on.</LINE>

<LINE offset="7">Thus, sir:</LINE>
<LINE>Although this lord of weak remembrance, this</LINE>

<LINE>When he is earth&#8217;d, hath here almost persuaded</LINE>
<LINE>(For he&#8217;s a spirit of persuasion, only</LINE>

<LINE>What great hope have you! No hope, that way, is</LINE>
<LINE>Another way so high a hope that even</LINE>
<LINE>Ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond,</LINE>

<LINE>The Man i&#8217; th&#8217; Moon&#8217;s too slow&#8212;till new-born chins</LINE>

<LINE>(And by that destiny) to perform an act</LINE>
<LINE>Whereof what&#8217;s past is prologue, what to come</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SEB.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">What stuff is this? How say you?</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis true, my brother&#8217;s daughter&#8217;s Queen of Tunis,</LINE>

<LINE>And let Sebastian wake.&#8221; Say this were death</LINE>
<LINE>That now hath seiz&#8217;d them, why, they were no worse</LINE>

<LINE>As well as he that sleeps; lords that can prate</LINE>
<LINE>As amply and unnecessarily</LINE>
<LINE>As this Gonzalo; I myself could make</LINE>
<LINE>A chough of as deep chat. O that you bore</LINE>

<LINE>Ay, sir; where lies that? If &#8217;twere a kibe,</LINE>

<LINE>That stand &#8217;twixt me and Milan, candied be they,</LINE>

<LINE>To the perpetual wink for aye might put</LINE>
<LINE>This ancient morsel, this Sir Prudence, who</LINE>
<LINE>Should not upbraid our course. For all the rest,</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Whiles we stood here securing your repose,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">I heard nothing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Upon mine honor, sir, I heard a humming</LINE>
<LINE>(And that a strange one too) which did awake me.</LINE>
<LINE>I shak&#8217;d you, sir, and cried. As mine eyes open&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>I saw their weapons drawn. There was a noise,</LINE>
<LINE>That&#8217;s verily. &#8217;Tis best we stand upon our guard,</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Caliban with a burden of wood. A noise of thunder heard.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>All the infections that the sun sucks up</LINE>
<LINE>From bogs, fens, flats, on Prosper fall, and make him</LINE>
<LINE>By inch-meal a disease! His spirits hear me,</LINE>
<LINE>And yet I needs must curse. But they&#8217;ll nor pinch,</LINE>
<LINE>Fright me with urchin-shows, pitch me i&#8217; th&#8217; mire,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor lead me, like a fire-brand, in the dark</LINE>
<LINE>Out of my way, unless he bid &#8217;em; but</LINE>
<LINE>For every trifle are they set upon me,</LINE>
<LINE>Sometime like apes that mow and chatter at me,</LINE>
<LINE>And after bite me; then like hedgehogs which</LINE>
<LINE>Lie tumbling in my barefoot way, and mount</LINE>
<LINE>Their pricks at my footfall; sometime am I</LINE>
<LINE>All wound with adders, who with cloven tongues</LINE>
<LINE>Do hiss me into madness.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Trinculo.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Lo, now lo,</LINE>
<LINE>Here comes a spirit of his, and to torment me</LINE>
<LINE>For bringing wood in slowly. I&#8217;ll fall flat,</LINE>
<LINE>Perchance he will not mind me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRIN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here&#8217;s neither bush nor shrub to bear off any weather at all. And another storm brewing, I hear it sing i&#8217; th&#8217; wind. Yond same black cloud, yond huge one, looks like a foul bumbard that would shed his liquor. If it should thunder as it did before, I know not where to hide my head. Yond same cloud cannot choose but fall by pailfuls. What have we here? A man or a fish? Dead or alive? A fish, he smells like a fish; a very ancient and fish-like smell; a kind of, not-of-the-newest poor-John. A strange fish! Were I in England now (as once I was) and had but this fish painted, not a holiday fool there but would give a piece of silver. There would this monster make a man; any strange beast there makes a man. When they will not give a doit to relieve a lame beggar, they will lay out ten to see a dead Indian. Legg&#8217;d like a man; and his fins like arms! Warm, o&#8217; my troth! I do now let loose my opinion, hold it no longer: this is no fish, but an islander, that hath lately suffer&#8217;d by a thunderbolt.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Thunder.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Alas, the storm is come again! My best way is to creep under his gaberdine; there is no other shelter hereabout. Misery acquaints a man with strange bedfellows; I will here shroud till the dregs of the storm be past.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Stephano, singing, a bottle in his hand.</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>What&#8217;s the matter? Have we devils here? Do you put tricks upon &#8217;s with salvages and men of Inde? Ha? I have not scap&#8217;d drowning to be afeard now of your four legs; for it hath been said, &#8220;As proper a man as ever went on four legs cannot make him give ground&#8221;; and it shall be said so again while Stephano breathes at&#8217; nostrils.</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>The spirit torments me! O!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>STE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This is some monster of the isle with four legs, who hath got (as I take it) an ague. Where the devil should he learn our language? I will give him some relief, if it be but for that. If I can recover him, and keep him tame, and get to Naples with him, he&#8217;s a present for any emperor that ever trod on neat&#8217;s-leather.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Do not torment me, prithee. I&#8217;ll bring my wood home faster.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>STE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He&#8217;s in his fit now, and does not talk after the wisest. He shall taste of my bottle; if he have never drunk wine afore, it will go near to remove his fit. If I can recover him, and keep him tame, I will not take too much for him; he shall pay for him that hath him, and that soundly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou dost me yet but little hurt; thou wilt anon, I know it by thy trembling. Now Prosper works upon thee.</LINE>

<LINE>Come on your ways. Open your mouth; here is that which will give language to you, cat. Open your mouth; this will shake your shaking, I can tell you, and that soundly. You cannot tell who&#8217;s your friend. Open your chaps again.</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>STE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Four legs and two voices; a most delicate monster! His forward voice now is to speak well of his friend; his backward voice is to utter foul speeches and to detract. If all the wine in my bottle will recover him, I will help his ague. Come.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Caliban drinks again.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Amen! I will pour some in thy other mouth.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>TRIN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I took him to be kill&#8217;d with a thunder-stroke. But art thou not drown&#8217;d, Stephano? I hope now thou art not drown&#8217;d. Is the storm overblown?

<LINE>To th&#8217; dulling of my spirits. Sit down, and rest.</LINE>
<LINE>Even here I will put off my hope, and keep it</LINE>
<LINE>No longer for my flatterer. He is drown&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>Whom thus we stray to find, and the sea mocks</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Alonso, Sebastian, etc. Draw their swords.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE offset="4">You fools! I and my fellows</LINE>

<LINE>Wound the loud winds, or with bemock&#8217;d-at stabs</LINE>
<LINE>Kill the still-closing waters, as diminish</LINE>

<LINE>(For that&#8217;s my business to you) that you three</LINE>

<LINE>I thought to have told thee of it, but I fear&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>Lest I might anger thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PROS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Say again, where didst thou leave these varlots?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARI.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I told you, sir, they were red-hot with drinking,</LINE>
<LINE>So full of valor that they smote the air</LINE>
<LINE>For breathing in their faces; beat the ground</LINE>
<LINE>For kissing of their feet; yet always bending</LINE>
<LINE>Towards their project. Then I beat my tabor,</LINE>
<LINE>At which like unback&#8217;d colts they prick&#8217;d their ears,</LINE>
<LINE>Advanc&#8217;d their eyelids, lifted up their noses</LINE>
<LINE>As they smelt music. So I charm&#8217;d their ears</LINE>
<LINE>That calf-like they my lowing follow&#8217;d through</LINE>
<LINE>Tooth&#8217;d briers, sharp furzes, pricking goss, and thorns,</LINE>
<LINE>Which ent&#8217;red their frail shins. At last I left them</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217; th&#8217; filthy-mantled pool beyond your cell,</LINE>
<LINE>There dancing up to th&#8217; chins, that the foul lake</LINE>
<LINE>O&#8217;erstunk their feet.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PROS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">This was well done, my bird.</LINE>

<LINE>A devil, a born devil, on whose nature</LINE>
<LINE>Nurture can never stick; on whom my pains,</LINE>
<LINE>Humanely taken, all, all lost, quite lost;</LINE>
<LINE>And as with age his body uglier grows,</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRIN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, but to lose our bottles in the pool&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>STE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There is not only disgrace and dishonor in that, monster, but an infinite loss.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRIN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That&#8217;s more to me than my wetting; yet this is your harmless fairy, monster!</LINE>

<LINE>O, ho, monster! We know what belongs to a frippery. O King Stephano!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>Put off that gown, Trinculo. By this hand, I&#8217;ll have that gown.</LINE>

<LINE>The dropsy drown this fool! What do you mean</LINE>
<LINE>To dote thus on such luggage? Let&#8217;t alone</LINE>

<LINE>Make us strange stuff.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>STE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Be you quiet, monster. Mistress line, is not this my jerkin? Now is the jerkin under the line. Now, jerkin, you are like to lose your hair, and prove a bald jerkin.</LINE>

<LINE>Do, do; we steal by line and level, and&#8217;t like your Grace.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>STE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I thank thee for that jest; here&#8217;s a garment for&#8217;t. Wit shall not go unrewarded while I am king of this country. &#8217;Steal by line and level&#8217; is an excellent pass of pate; there&#8217;s another garment for&#8217;t.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>TRIN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Monster, come put some lime upon your fingers, and away with the rest.</LINE>

<SPEECH>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>STE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Monster, lay-to your fingers. Help to bear this away where my hogshead of wine is, or I&#8217;ll turn you out of my kingdom. Go to, carry this.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Prospero in his magic robes, and Ariel.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PROS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now does my project gather to a head:</LINE>
<LINE>My charms crack not; my spirits obey; and Time</LINE>
<LINE>Goes upright with his carriage. How&#8217;s the day?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARI.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>On the sixt hour, at which time, my lord,</LINE>
<LINE>You said our work should cease.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PROS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">I did say so,</LINE>
<LINE>When first I rais&#8217;d the tempest. Say, my spirit,</LINE>
<LINE>How fares the King and &#8217;s followers?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARI.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="8">Confin&#8217;d together</LINE>
<LINE>In the same fashion as you gave in charge,</LINE>
<LINE>Just as you left them; all prisoners, sir,</LINE>
<LINE>In the line-grove which weather-fends your cell;</LINE>
<LINE>They cannot boudge till your release. The King,</LINE>
<LINE>His brother, and yours, abide all three distracted,</LINE>
<LINE>And the remainder mourning over them,</LINE>
<LINE>Brimful of sorrow and dismay; but chiefly</LINE>
<LINE>Him that you term&#8217;d, sir, &#8220;the good old Lord Gonzalo,&#8221;</LINE>
<LINE>His tears runs down his beard like winter&#8217;s drops</LINE>
<LINE>From eaves of reeds. Your charm so strongly works &#8217;em</LINE>
<LINE>That if you now beheld them, your affections</LINE>
<LINE>Would become tender.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PROS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Dost thou think so, spirit?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARI.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Mine would, sir, were I human.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PROS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">And mine shall.</LINE>
<LINE>Hast thou, which art but air, a touch, a feeling</LINE>
<LINE>Of their afflictions, and shall not myself,</LINE>
<LINE>One of their kind, that relish all as sharply</LINE>
<LINE>Passion as they, be kindlier mov&#8217;d than thou art?</LINE>
<LINE>Though with their high wrongs I am strook to th&#8217; quick,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet, with my nobler reason, &#8217;gainst my fury</LINE>
<LINE>Do I take part. The rarer action is</LINE>
<LINE>In virtue than in vengeance. They being penitent,</LINE>
<LINE>The sole drift of my purpose doth extend</LINE>
<LINE>Not a frown further. Go, release them, Ariel.</LINE>
<LINE>My charms I&#8217;ll break, their senses I&#8217;ll restore,</LINE>
<LINE>And they shall be themselves.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARI.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">I&#8217;ll fetch them, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit. Prospero traces a magic circle with his staff.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PROS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ye elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes, and groves,</LINE>
<LINE>And ye that on the sands with printless foot</LINE>
<LINE>Do chase the ebbing Neptune, and do fly him</LINE>
<LINE>When he comes back; you demi-puppets that</LINE>
<LINE>By moonshine do the green sour ringlets make,</LINE>
<LINE>Whereof the ewe not bites; and you whose pastime</LINE>
<LINE>Is to make midnight mushrumps, that rejoice</LINE>
<LINE>To hear the solemn curfew: by whose aid</LINE>
<LINE>(Weak masters though ye be) I have bedimm&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>The noontide sun, call&#8217;d forth the mutinous winds,</LINE>
<LINE>And &#8217;twixt the green sea and the azur&#8217;d vault</LINE>
<LINE>Set roaring war; to the dread rattling thunder</LINE>
<LINE>Have I given fire, and rifted Jove&#8217;s stout oak</LINE>
<LINE>With his own bolt; the strong-bas&#8217;d promontory</LINE>
<LINE>Have I made shake, and by the spurs pluck&#8217;d up</LINE>
<LINE>The pine and cedar. Graves at my command</LINE>
<LINE>Have wak&#8217;d their sleepers, op&#8217;d, and let &#8217;em forth</LINE>
<LINE>By my so potent art. But this rough magic</LINE>
<LINE>I here abjure; and when I have requir&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>Some heavenly music (which even now I do)</LINE>
<LINE>To work mine end upon their senses that</LINE>
<LINE>This airy charm is for, I&#8217;ll break my staff,</LINE>
<LINE>Bury it certain fathoms in the earth,</LINE>
<LINE>And deeper than did ever plummet sound</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll drown my book.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Solemn music.</STAGEDIR>
<STAGEDIR>Here enters Ariel before; then Alonso, with a frantic gesture, attended by Gonzalo; Sebastian and Antonio in like manner, attended by Adrian and Francisco. They all enter the circle which Prospero had made, and there stand charm&#8217;d; which Prospero observing, speaks.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>A solemn air, and the best comforter</LINE>
<LINE>To an unsettled fancy, cure thy brains,</LINE>
<LINE>Now useless, boil&#8217;d within thy skull! There stand,</LINE>
<LINE>For you are spell-stopp&#8217;d.</LINE>
<LINE>Holy Gonzalo, honorable man,</LINE>
<LINE>Mine eyes, ev&#8217;n sociable to the show of thine,</LINE>
<LINE>Fall fellowly drops. The charm dissolves apace,</LINE>
<LINE>And as the morning steals upon the night,</LINE>
<LINE>Melting the darkness, so their rising senses</LINE>
<LINE>Begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle</LINE>
<LINE>Their clearer reason. O good Gonzalo,</LINE>
<LINE>My true preserver, and a loyal sir</LINE>
<LINE>To him thou follow&#8217;st! I will pay thy graces</LINE>
<LINE>Home both in word and deed. Most cruelly</LINE>
<LINE>Didst thou, Alonso, use me and my daughter;</LINE>
<LINE>Thy brother was a furtherer in the act.</LINE>
<LINE>Thou art pinch&#8217;d for&#8217;t now, Sebastian. Flesh and blood,</LINE>
<LINE>You, brother mine, that entertain&#8217;d ambition,</LINE>
<LINE>Expell&#8217;d remorse and nature, whom, with Sebastian</LINE>
<LINE>(Whose inward pinches therefore are most strong),</LINE>
<LINE>Would here have kill&#8217;d your king, I do forgive thee,</LINE>
<LINE>Unnatural though thou art.&#8212;Their understanding</LINE>
<LINE>Begins to swell, and the approaching tide</LINE>
<LINE>Will shortly fill the reasonable shores</LINE>
<LINE>That now lie foul and muddy. Not one of them</LINE>
<LINE>That yet looks on me, or would know me! Ariel,</LINE>
<LINE>Fetch me the hat and rapier in my cell.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exit Ariel, and returns immediately.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>I will discase me, and myself present</LINE>
<LINE>As I was sometime Milan. Quickly, spirit,</LINE>

<SPEAKER>ALON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Whe&#8217;er thou beest he or no,</LINE>
<LINE>Or some enchanted trifle to abuse me</LINE>

<LINE>Th&#8217; affliction of my mind amends, with which</LINE>

<LINE>O heavens, that they were living both in Naples,</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PROS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In this last tempest. I perceive these lords</LINE>
<LINE>At this encounter do so much admire</LINE>
<LINE>That they devour their reason, and scarce think</LINE>
<LINE>Their eyes do offices of truth, their words</LINE>
<LINE>Are natural breath; but howsoev&#8217;r you have</LINE>
<LINE>Been justled from your senses, know for certain</LINE>
<LINE>That I am Prospero, and that very duke</LINE>
<LINE>Which was thrust forth of Milan, who most strangely</LINE>
<LINE>Upon this shore (where you were wrack&#8217;d) was landed,</LINE>
<LINE>To be the lord on&#8217;t. No more yet of this,</LINE>
<LINE>For &#8217;tis a chronicle of day by day,</LINE>
<LINE>Not a relation for a breakfast, nor</LINE>
<LINE>Befitting this first meeting. Welcome, sir;</LINE>
<LINE>This cell&#8217;s my court. Here have I few attendants,</LINE>
<LINE>And subjects none abroad. Pray you look in.</LINE>
<LINE>My dukedom since you have given me again,</LINE>
<LINE>I will requite you with as good a thing,</LINE>
<LINE>At least bring forth a wonder, to content ye</LINE>
<LINE>As much as me my dukedom.</LINE>

<LINE>For his advice, nor thought I had one. She</LINE>
<LINE>Is daughter to this famous Duke of Milan,</LINE>
<LINE>Of whom so often I have heard renown,</LINE>
<LINE>But never saw before; of whom I have</LINE>
<LINE>Receiv&#8217;d a second life; and second father</LINE>
<LINE>This lady makes him to me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">I am hers.</LINE>
<LINE>But O, how oddly will it sound that I</LINE>
<LINE>Must ask my child forgiveness!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PROS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">There, sir, stop.</LINE>
<LINE>Let us not burden our remembrances with</LINE>
<LINE>A heaviness that&#8217;s gone.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">I have inly wept,</LINE>
<LINE>Or should have spoke ere this. Look down, you gods,</LINE>
<LINE>And on this couple drop a blessed crown!</LINE>
<LINE>For it is you that have chalk&#8217;d forth the way</LINE>
<LINE>Which brought us hither.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">I say amen, Gonzalo!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Was Milan thrust from Milan, that his issue</LINE>
<LINE>Should become kings of Naples? O, rejoice</LINE>
<LINE>Beyond a common joy, and set it down</LINE>
<LINE>With gold on lasting pillars: in one voyage</LINE>
<LINE>Did Claribel her husband find at Tunis,</LINE>
<LINE>And Ferdinand, her brother, found a wife</LINE>
<LINE>Where he himself was lost; Prospero, his dukedom</LINE>
<LINE>In a poor isle; and all of us, ourselves,</LINE>
<LINE>When no man was his own.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALON.</SPEAKER>
<STAGEDIR>To Ferdinand and Miranda.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE offset="5">Give me your hands.</LINE>
<LINE>Let grief and sorrow still embrace his heart</LINE>
<LINE>That doth not wish you joy!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">Be it so, amen!</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Ariel, with the Master and Boatswain amazedly following.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>O, look, sir, look, sir, here is more of us.</LINE>
<LINE>I prophesied, if a gallows were on land,</LINE>
<LINE>This fellow could not drown. Now, blasphemy,</LINE>
<LINE>That swear&#8217;st grace o&#8217;erboard, not an oath on shore?</LINE>
<LINE>Hast thou no mouth by land? What is the news?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BOATS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The best news is, that we have safely found</LINE>
<LINE>Our king and company; the next, our ship&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Which, but three glasses since, we gave out split&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Is tight and yare, and bravely rigg&#8217;d as when</LINE>
<LINE>We first put out to sea.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARI.</SPEAKER>
<STAGEDIR>Aside to Prospero.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE offset="5">Sir, all this service</LINE>
<LINE>Have I done since I went.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PROS.</SPEAKER>
<STAGEDIR>Aside to Ariel.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE offset="5">My tricksy spirit!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>These are not natural events, they strengthen</LINE>
<LINE>From strange to stranger. Say, how came you hither?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BOATS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If I did think, sir, I were well awake,</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ld strive to tell you. We were dead of sleep,</LINE>
<LINE>And (how we know not) all clapp&#8217;d under hatches,</LINE>
<LINE>Where, but even now, with strange and several noises</LINE>
<LINE>Of roaring, shrieking, howling, jingling chains,</LINE>
<LINE>And more diversity of sounds, all horrible,</LINE>
<LINE>We were awak&#8217;d; straightway, at liberty;</LINE>
<LINE>Where we, in all our trim, freshly beheld</LINE>
<LINE>Our royal, good, and gallant ship; our master</LINE>
<LINE>Cap&#8217;ring to eye her. On a trice, so please you,</LINE>
<LINE>Even in a dream, were we divided from them,</LINE>
<LINE>And were brought moping hither.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARI.</SPEAKER>
<STAGEDIR>Aside to Prospero.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE offset="7">Was&#8217;t well done?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PROS.</SPEAKER>
<STAGEDIR>Aside to Ariel.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Bravely, my diligence. Thou shalt be free.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This is as strange a maze as e&#8217;er men trod,</LINE>
<LINE>And there is in this business more than nature</LINE>
<LINE>Was ever conduct of. Some oracle</LINE>
<LINE>Must rectify our knowledge.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PROS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">Sir, my liege,</LINE>
<LINE>Do not infest your mind with beating on</LINE>
<LINE>The strangeness of this business. At pick&#8217;d leisure,</LINE>
<LINE>Which shall be shortly, single I&#8217;ll resolve you</LINE>
<LINE>(Which to you shall seem probable) of every</LINE>
<LINE>These happen&#8217;d accidents; till when, be cheerful</LINE>
<LINE>And think of each thing well.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Aside to Ariel.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE offset="6">Come hither, spirit.</LINE>
<LINE>Set Caliban and his companions free;</LINE>
<LINE>Untie the spell.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exit Ariel.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE offset="3">How fares my gracious sir?</LINE>
<LINE>There are yet missing of your company</LINE>
<LINE>Some few odd lads that you remember not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Ariel, driving in Caliban, Stephano, and Trinculo in their stol&#8217;n apparel.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>STE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Every man shift for all the rest, and let no man take care for himself; for all is but fortune. Coraggio, bully-monster, coraggio!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRIN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If these be true spies which I wear in my head, here&#8217;s a goodly sight.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O Setebos, these be brave spirits indeed!</LINE>
<LINE>How fine my master is! I am afraid</LINE>
<LINE>He will chastise me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SEB.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Ha, ha!</LINE>
<LINE>What things are these, my Lord Antonio?</LINE>
<LINE>Will money buy &#8217;em?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Very like; one of them</LINE>
<LINE>Is a plain fish, and no doubt marketable.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PROS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Mark but the badges of these men, my lords,</LINE>
<LINE>Then say if they be true. This misshapen knave&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>His mother was a witch, and one so strong</LINE>
<LINE>That could control the moon, make flows and ebbs,</LINE>
<LINE>And deal in her command without her power.</LINE>
<LINE>These three have robb&#8217;d me, and this demi-devil</LINE>
<LINE>(For he&#8217;s a bastard one) had plotted with them</LINE>
<LINE>To take my life. Two of these fellows you</LINE>
<LINE>Must know and own, this thing of darkness I</LINE>
<LINE>Acknowledge mine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">I shall be pinch&#8217;d to death.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is not this Stephano, my drunken butler?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SEB.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He is drunk now. Where had he wine?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And Trinculo is reeling ripe. Where should they</LINE>
<LINE>Find this grand liquor that hath gilded &#8217;em?</LINE>
<LINE>How cam&#8217;st thou in this pickle?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRIN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have been in such a pickle since I saw you last that I fear me will never out of my bones. I shall not fear fly-blowing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SEB.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, how now, Stephano?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>STE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, touch me not, I am not Stephano, but a cramp.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PROS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You&#8217;ld be king o&#8217; the isle, sirrah?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>STE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I should have been a sore one then.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This is a strange thing as e&#8217;er I look&#8217;d on.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Pointing to Caliban.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PROS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He is as disproportion&#8217;d in his manners</LINE>
<LINE>As in his shape. Go, sirrah, to my cell;</LINE>
<LINE>Take with you your companions. As you look</LINE>
<LINE>To have my pardon, trim it handsomely.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, that I will; and I&#8217;ll be wise hereafter,</LINE>
<LINE>And seek for grace. What a thrice-double ass</LINE>
<LINE>Was I to take this drunkard for a god,</LINE>
<LINE>And worship this dull fool!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PROS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Go to, away!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hence, and bestow your luggage where you found it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SEB.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Or stole it, rather.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt Caliban, Stephano, and Trinculo.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PROS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, I invite your Highness and your train</LINE>
<LINE>To my poor cell, where you shall take your rest</LINE>
<LINE>For this one night; which, part of it, I&#8217;ll waste</LINE>
<LINE>With such discourse as, I not doubt, shall make it</LINE>
<LINE>Go quick away&#8212;the story of my life,</LINE>
<LINE>And the particular accidents gone by</LINE>
<LINE>Since I came to this isle. And in the morn</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll bring you to your ship, and so to Naples,</LINE>
<LINE>Where I have hope to see the nuptial</LINE>
<LINE>Of these our dear-belov&#8217;d solemnized,</LINE>
<LINE>And thence retire me to my Milan, where</LINE>
<LINE>Every third thought shall be my grave.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="8">I long</LINE>
<LINE>To hear the story of your life, which must</LINE>
<LINE>Take the ear strangely.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PROS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">I&#8217;ll deliver all,</LINE>
<LINE>And promise you calm seas, auspicious gales,</LINE>
<LINE>And sail so expeditious, that shall catch</LINE>
<LINE>Your royal fleet far off.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Aside to Ariel.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE offset="5">My Ariel, chick,</LINE>
<LINE>That is thy charge. Then to the elements</LINE>
<LINE>Be free, and fare thou well!&#8212;Please you draw near.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>PROS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="2">Now my charms are all o&#8217;erthrown,</LINE>
<LINE offset="2">And what strength I have&#8217;s mine own,</LINE>
<LINE offset="2">Which is most faint. Now &#8217;tis true,</LINE>
<LINE offset="2">I must be here confin&#8217;d by you,</LINE>
<LINE offset="2">Or sent to Naples. Let me not,</LINE>
<LINE offset="2">Since I have my dukedom got,</LINE>
<LINE offset="2">And pardon&#8217;d the deceiver, dwell</LINE>
<LINE offset="2">In this bare island by your spell,</LINE>
<LINE offset="2">But release me from my bands</LINE>
<LINE offset="2">With the help of your good hands.</LINE>
<LINE offset="2">Gentle breath of yours my sails</LINE>
<LINE offset="2">Must fill, or else my project fails,</LINE>
<LINE offset="2">Which was to please. Now I want</LINE>
<LINE offset="2">Spirits to enforce, art to enchant,</LINE>
<LINE offset="2">And my ending is despair,</LINE>
<LINE offset="2">Unless I be reliev&#8217;d by prayer,</LINE>
<LINE offset="2">Which pierces so, that it assaults</LINE>
<LINE offset="2">Mercy itself, and frees all faults.</LINE>
<LINE offset="2">As you from crimes would pardon&#8217;d be,</LINE>
<LINE offset="2">Let your indulgence set me free.</LINE>
