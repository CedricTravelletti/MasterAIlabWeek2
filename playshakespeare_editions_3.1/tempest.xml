<stagedir>A tempestuous noise of thunder and lightning heard. Enter a Ship-Master and a Boatswain.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>MAST.</speaker>
<line>Boatswain!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BOATS.</speaker>
<line>Here, master; what cheer?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MAST.</speaker>
<line>Good; speak to th&#8217; mariners. Fall to&#8217;t, yarely, or we run ourselves aground. Bestir, bestir.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit.</stagedir>

<stagedir>Enter Mariners.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>BOATS.</speaker>
<line>Heigh, my hearts! Cheerly, cheerly, my hearts! Yare, yare! Take in the topsail. Tend to th&#8217; master&#8217;s whistle.&#8212;Blow till thou burst thy wind, if room enough!</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Alonso, Sebastian, Antonio, Ferdinando, Gonzalo, and others.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>ALON.</speaker>
<line>Good boatswain, have care. Where&#8217;s the master? Play the men.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BOATS.</speaker>
<line>I pray now keep below.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANT.</speaker>
<line>Where is the master, bos&#8217;n?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BOATS.</speaker>
<line>Do you not hear him? You mar our labor. Keep your cabins; you do assist the storm.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GON.</speaker>
<line>Nay, good, be patient.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BOATS.</speaker>
<line>When the sea is. Hence! What cares these roarers for the name of king? To cabin! Silence! Trouble us not.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GON.</speaker>
<line>Good, yet remember whom thou hast aboard.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BOATS.</speaker>
<line>None that I more love than myself. You are a councillor; if you can command these elements to silence, and work the peace of the present, we will not hand a rope more. Use your authority. If you cannot, give thanks you have liv&#8217;d so long, and make yourself ready in your cabin for the mischance of the hour, if it so hap.&#8212;Cheerly, good hearts!&#8212;Out of our way, I say.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>GON.</speaker>
<line>I have great comfort from this fellow. Methinks he hath no drowning mark upon him, his complexion is perfect gallows. Stand fast, good Fate, to his hanging, make the rope of his destiny our cable, for our own doth little advantage. If he be not born to be hang&#8217;d, our case is miserable.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exeunt.</stagedir>

<stagedir>Enter Boatswain.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>BOATS.</speaker>
<line>Down with the topmast! Yare! Lower, lower! Bring her to try with main-course. (A cry within.) A plague upon this howling! They are louder than the weather, or our office.</line>

<stagedir>Enter Sebastian, Antonio, and Gonzalo.</stagedir>
<line>Yet again? What do you here? Shall we give o&#8217;er and drown? Have you a mind to sink?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SEB.</speaker>
<line>A pox o&#8217; your throat, you bawling, blasphemous, incharitable dog!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BOATS.</speaker>
<line>Work you then.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANT.</speaker>
<line>Hang, cur! Hang, you whoreson, insolent noisemaker! We are less afraid to be drown&#8217;d than thou art.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GON.</speaker>
<line>I&#8217;ll warrant him for drowning, though the ship were no stronger than a nutshell, and as leaky as an unstanch&#8217;d wench.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BOATS.</speaker>
<line>Lay her a-hold, a-hold! Set her two courses off to sea again! Lay her off.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Mariners wet.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>MARINERS.</speaker>
<line>All lost! To prayers, to prayers! All lost!</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exeunt.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>BOATS.</speaker>
<line>What, must our mouths be cold?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GON.</speaker>
<line>The King and Prince at prayers, let&#8217;s assist them,</line>
<line>For our case is as theirs.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SEB.</speaker>
<line offset="5">I am out of patience.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANT.</speaker>
<line>We are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards.</line>
<line>This wide-chopp&#8217;d rascal&#8212;would thou mightst lie drowning</line>
<line>The washing of ten tides!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GON.</speaker>
<line offset="5">He&#8217;ll be hang&#8217;d yet,</line>
<line>Though every drop of water swear against it,</line>
<line>And gape at wid&#8217;st to glut him.</line>

<stagedir>A confused noise within:</stagedir>
<line>&#8220;Mercy on us!&#8221;&#8212;</line>
<line>&#8220;We split, we split!&#8221;&#8212;&#8220;Farewell, my wife and children!&#8221;&#8212;</line>
<line>&#8220;Farewell, brother!&#8221;&#8212;&#8220;We split, we split, we split!&#8221;</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit Boatswain.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>ANT.</speaker>
<line>Let&#8217;s all sink wi&#8217; th&#8217; King.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SEB.</speaker>
<line>Lee&#8217;s take leave of him.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit with Antonio.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>GON.</speaker>
<line>Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea for an acre of barren ground, long heath, brown furze, any thing. The wills above be done! But I would fain die a dry death.</line>

<stagedir>Enter Prospero and Miranda.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>MIR.</speaker>
<line>If by your art, my dearest father, you have</line>
<line>Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them.</line>
<line>The sky it seems would pour down stinking pitch,</line>
<line>But that the sea, mounting to th&#8217; welkin&#8217;s cheek,</line>
<line>Dashes the fire out. O! I have suffered</line>
<line>With those that I saw suffer. A brave vessel</line>
<line>(Who had, no doubt, some noble creature in her)</line>
<line>Dash&#8217;d all to pieces! O, the cry did knock</line>
<line>Against my very heart. Poor souls, they perish&#8217;d.</line>
<line>Had I been any God of power, I would</line>
<line>Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere</line>
<line>It should the good ship so have swallow&#8217;d, and</line>
<line>The fraughting souls within her.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PROS.</speaker>
<line offset="7">Be collected,</line>
<line>No more amazement. Tell your piteous heart</line>
<line>There&#8217;s no harm done.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MIR.</speaker>
<line offset="4">O woe the day!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PROS.</speaker>
<line offset="8">No harm:</line>
<line>I have done nothing, but in care of thee</line>
<line>(Of thee my dear one, thee my daughter), who</line>
<line>Art ignorant of what thou art, nought knowing</line>
<line>Of whence I am, nor that I am more better</line>
<line>Than Prospero, master of a full poor cell,</line>
<line>And thy no greater father.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MIR.</speaker>
<line offset="5">More to know</line>
<line>Did never meddle with my thoughts.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PROS.</speaker>
<line offset="7">&#8217;Tis time</line>
<line>I should inform thee farther. Lend thy hand,</line>
<line>And pluck my magic garment from me. So,</line>

<stagedir>Lays down his mantle.</stagedir>
<line>Lie there, my art. Wipe thou thine eyes, have comfort.</line>
<line>The direful spectacle of the wrack, which touch&#8217;d</line>
<line>The very virtue of compassion in thee,</line>
<line>I have with such provision in mine art</line>
<line>So safely ordered that there is no soul&#8212;</line>
<line>No, not so much perdition as an hair</line>
<line>Betid to any creature in the vessel</line>
<line>Which thou heardst cry, which thou saw&#8217;st sink. Sit down,</line>
<line>For thou must now know farther.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MIR.</speaker>
<line offset="7">You have often</line>
<line>Begun to tell me what I am, but stopp&#8217;d</line>
<line>And left me to a bootless inquisition,</line>
<line>Concluding, &#8220;Stay: not yet.&#8221;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PROS.</speaker>
<line offset="6">The hour&#8217;s now come,</line>
<line>The very minute bids thee ope thine ear.</line>
<line>Obey, and be attentive. Canst thou remember</line>
<line>A time before we came unto this cell?</line>
<line>I do not think thou canst, for then thou wast not</line>
<line>Out three years old.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MIR.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Certainly, sir, I can.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PROS.</speaker>
<line>By what? By any other house, or person?</line>
<line>Of any thing the image, tell me, that</line>
<line>Hath kept with thy remembrance.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MIR.</speaker>
<line offset="7">&#8217;Tis far off;</line>
<line>And rather like a dream than an assurance</line>
<line>That my remembrance warrants. Had I not</line>
<line>Four, or five, women once that tended me?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PROS.</speaker>
<line>Thou hadst; and more, Miranda. But how is it</line>
<line>That this lives in thy mind? What seest thou else</line>
<line>In the dark backward and abysm of time?</line>
<line>If thou rememb&#8217;rest aught ere thou cam&#8217;st here,</line>
<line>How thou cam&#8217;st here thou mayst.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MIR.</speaker>
<line offset="7">But that I do not.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PROS.</speaker>
<line>Twelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since,</line>
<line>Thy father was the Duke of Milan and</line>

<speaker>MIR.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Sir, are not you my father?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PROS.</speaker>
<line>Thy mother was a piece of virtue, and</line>
<line>She said thou wast my daughter; and thy father</line>
<line>Was Duke of Milan, and his only heir</line>
<line>And princess no worse issued.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MIR.</speaker>
<line offset="6">O the heavens,</line>
<line>What foul play had we, that we came from thence?</line>
<line>Or blessed was&#8217;t we did?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PROS.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Both, both, my girl.</line>
<line>By foul play (as thou say&#8217;st) were we heav&#8217;d thence,</line>
<line>But blessedly holp hither.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MIR.</speaker>
<line offset="5">O, my heart bleeds</line>
<line>To think o&#8217; th&#8217; teen that I have turn&#8217;d you to,</line>
<line>Which is from my remembrance! Please you, farther.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PROS.</speaker>
<line>My brother and thy uncle, call&#8217;d Antonio&#8212;</line>
<line>I pray thee mark me&#8212;that a brother should</line>
<line>Be so perfidious!&#8212;he whom next thyself</line>
<line>Of all the world I lov&#8217;d, and to him put</line>
<line>The manage of my state, as at that time</line>
<line>Through all the signories it was the first,</line>
<line>And Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed</line>
<line>In dignity, and for the liberal arts</line>
<line>Without a parallel; those being all my study,</line>
<line>The government I cast upon my brother,</line>
<line>And to my state grew stranger, being transported</line>
<line>And rapt in secret studies. Thy false uncle&#8212;</line>
<line>Dost thou attend me?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MIR.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Sir, most heedfully.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PROS.</speaker>
<line>Being once perfected how to grant suits,</line>
<line>How to deny them, who t&#8217; advance, and who</line>

<line>The creatures that were mine, I say, or chang&#8217;d &#8217;em,</line>
<line>Or else new form&#8217;d &#8217;em; having both the key</line>
<line>Of officer and office, set all hearts i&#8217; th&#8217; state</line>
<line>To what tune pleas&#8217;d his ear, that now he was</line>
<line>The ivy which had hid my princely trunk,</line>
<line>And suck&#8217;d my verdure out on&#8217;t. Thou attend&#8217;st not!</line>
</speech>

<speaker>MIR.</speaker>
<line>O, good sir, I do.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PROS.</speaker>
<line offset="4">I pray thee mark me.</line>
<line>I, thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicated</line>

<line>With that which, but by being so retir&#8217;d,</line>
<line>O&#8217;er-priz&#8217;d all popular rate, in my false brother</line>
<line>Awak&#8217;d an evil nature, and my trust,</line>
<line>Like a good parent, did beget of him</line>
<line>A falsehood in its contrary, as great</line>
<line>As my trust was, which had indeed no limit,</line>
<line>A confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded,</line>
<line>Not only with what my revenue yielded,</line>
<line>But what my power might else exact&#8212;like one</line>
<line>Who having into truth, by telling of it,</line>
<line>Made such a sinner of his memory</line>
<line>To credit his own lie&#8212;he did believe</line>
<line>He was indeed the Duke, out o&#8217; th&#8217; substitution,</line>
<line>And executing th&#8217; outward face of royalty</line>
<line>With all prerogative. Hence his ambition growing&#8212;</line>
<line>Dost thou hear?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MIR.</speaker>
<line offset="3">Your tale, sir, would cure deafness.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PROS.</speaker>
<line>To have no screen between this part he play&#8217;d</line>
<line>And him he play&#8217;d it for, he needs will be</line>
<line>Absolute Milan&#8212;me (poor man) my library</line>
<line>Was dukedom large enough: of temporal royalties</line>
<line>He thinks me now incapable; confederates</line>
<line>(So dry he was for sway) wi&#8217; th&#8217; King of Naples</line>
<line>To give him annual tribute, do him homage,</line>
<line>Subject his coronet to his crown, and bend</line>
<line>The dukedom yet unbow&#8217;d (alas, poor Milan!)</line>
<line>To most ignoble stooping.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>MIR.</speaker>

<line>To think but nobly of my grandmother.</line>
<line>Good wombs have borne bad sons.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PROS.</speaker>
<line offset="7">Now the condition.</line>
<line>This King of Naples, being an enemy</line>
<line>To me inveterate, hearkens my brother&#8217;s suit,</line>
<line>Which was, that he in lieu o&#8217; th&#8217; premises,</line>
<line>Of homage, and I know not how much tribute,</line>
<line>Should presently extirpate me and mine</line>
<line>Out of the dukedom, and confer fair Milan</line>
<line>With all the honors on my brother; whereon,</line>
<line>A treacherous army levied, one midnight</line>
<line>Fated to th&#8217; purpose, did Antonio open</line>
<line>The gates of Milan, and i&#8217; th&#8217; dead of darkness</line>
<line>The ministers for th&#8217; purpose hurried thence</line>
<line>Me and thy crying self.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MIR.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Alack, for pity!</line>
<line>I, not rememb&#8217;ring how I cried out then,</line>
<line>Will cry it o&#8217;er again. It is a hint</line>
<line>That wrings mine eyes to&#8217;t.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PROS.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Hear a little further,</line>
<line>And then I&#8217;ll bring thee to the present business</line>
<line>Which now&#8217;s upon &#8217;s; without the which this story</line>
<line>Were most impertinent.</line>

<line>That hour destroy us?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PROS.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Well demanded, wench;</line>
<line>My tale provokes that question. Dear, they durst not,</line>
<line>So dear the love my people bore me; nor set</line>
<line>A mark so bloody on the business; but</line>
<line>With colors fairer painted their foul ends.</line>
<line>In few, they hurried us aboard a bark,</line>
<line>Bore us some leagues to sea, where they prepared</line>
<line>A rotten carcass of a butt, not rigg&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Nor tackle, sail, nor mast, the very rats</line>
<line>Instinctively have quit it. There they hoist us,</line>
<line>To cry to th&#8217; sea, that roar&#8217;d to us; to sigh</line>
<line>To th&#8217; winds, whose pity, sighing back again,</line>
<line>Did us but loving wrong.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MIR.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Alack, what trouble</line>
<line>Was I then to you!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PROS.</speaker>
<line offset="4">O, a cherubin</line>
<line>Thou wast that did preserve me. Thou didst smile,</line>
<line>Infused with a fortitude from heaven,</line>
<line>When I have deck&#8217;d the sea with drops full salt,</line>
<line>Under my burden groan&#8217;d, which rais&#8217;d in me</line>
<line>An undergoing stomach, to bear up</line>
<line>Against what should ensue.</line>

<speaker>MIR.</speaker>
<line offset="5">How came we ashore?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PROS.</speaker>
<line>By Providence divine.</line>
<line>Some food we had, and some fresh water, that</line>
<line>A noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo,</line>
<line>Out of his charity, who being then appointed</line>
<line>Master of this design, did give us, with</line>
<line>Rich garments, linens, stuffs, and necessaries,</line>
<line>Which since have steaded much; so of his gentleness,</line>
<line>Knowing I lov&#8217;d my books, he furnish&#8217;d me</line>
<line>From mine own library with volumes that</line>
<line>I prize above my dukedom.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MIR.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Would I might</line>
<line>But ever see that man!</line>

<line>Sit still, and hear the last of our sea-sorrow:</line>
<line>Here in this island we arriv&#8217;d, and here</line>
<line>Have I, thy schoolmaster, made thee more profit</line>
<line>Than other princess&#8217; can, that have more time</line>
<line>For vainer hours, and tutors not so careful.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MIR.</speaker>
<line>Heavens thank you for&#8217;t! And now I pray you, sir,</line>
<line>For still &#8217;tis beating in my mind, your reason</line>
<line>For raising this sea-storm?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PROS.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Know thus far forth:</line>
<line>By accident most strange, bountiful Fortune</line>
<line>(Now my dear lady) hath mine enemies</line>
<line>Brought to this shore; and by my prescience</line>
<line>I find my zenith doth depend upon</line>
<line>A most auspicious star, whose influence</line>
<line>If now I court not, but omit, my fortunes</line>
<line>Will ever after droop. Here cease more questions.</line>
<line>Thou art inclin&#8217;d to sleep; &#8217;tis a good dullness,</line>
<line>And give it way. I know thou canst not choose.</line>

<stagedir>Miranda sleeps.</stagedir>
<line>Come away, servant, come; I am ready now,</line>
<line>Approach, my Ariel. Come.</line>

<line>I boarded the King&#8217;s ship; now on the beak,</line>
<line>Now in the waist, the deck, in every cabin,</line>
<line>I flam&#8217;d amazement. Sometime I&#8217;ld divide,</line>
<line>And burn in many places; on the topmast,</line>
<line>The yards and boresprit, would I flame distinctly,</line>
<line>Then meet and join. Jove&#8217;s lightning, the precursors</line>
<line>O&#8217; th&#8217; dreadful thunder-claps, more momentary</line>
<line>And sight-outrunning were not; the fire and cracks</line>
<line>Of sulphurous roaring the most mighty Neptune</line>

<line>Yea, his dread trident shake.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PROS.</speaker>

<speech>
<speaker>ARI.</speaker>
<line offset="6">Not a soul</line>
<line>But felt a fever of the mad, and play&#8217;d</line>
<line>Some tricks of desperation. All but mariners</line>
<line>Plung&#8217;d in the foaming brine, and quit the vessel;</line>
<line>Then all afire with me, the King&#8217;s son, Ferdinand,</line>
<line>With hair up-staring (then like reeds, not hair),</line>

<line>You cram these words into mine ears against</line>

<line>Who is so far from Italy removed</line>
<line>I ne&#8217;er again shall see her. O thou mine heir</line>

<speaker>FRAN.</speaker>
<line offset="6">Sir, he may live.</line>
<line>I saw him beat the surges under him,</line>

<line>The surge most swoll&#8217;n that met him. His bold head</line>
<line>&#8217;Bove the contentious waves he kept, and oared</line>
<line>Himself with his good arms in lusty stroke</line>
<line>To th&#8217; shore, that o&#8217;er his wave-worn basis bowed,</line>

<line>Here&#8217;s neither bush nor shrub to bear off any weather at all. And another storm brewing, I hear it sing i&#8217; th&#8217; wind. Yond same black cloud, yond huge one, looks like a foul bumbard that would shed his liquor. If it should thunder as it did before, I know not where to hide my head. Yond same cloud cannot choose but fall by pailfuls. What have we here? A man or a fish? Dead or alive? A fish, he smells like a fish; a very ancient and fish-like smell; a kind of, not-of-the-newest poor-John. A strange fish! Were I in England now (as once I was) and had but this fish painted, not a holiday fool there but would give a piece of silver. There would this monster make a man; any strange beast there makes a man. When they will not give a doit to relieve a lame beggar, they will lay out ten to see a dead Indian. Legg&#8217;d like a man; and his fins like arms! Warm, o&#8217; my troth! I do now let loose my opinion, hold it no longer: this is no fish, but an islander, that hath lately suffer&#8217;d by a thunderbolt.</line>
<stagedir>Thunder.</stagedir>
<line>Alas, the storm is come again! My best way is to creep under his gaberdine; there is no other shelter hereabout. Misery acquaints a man with strange bedfellows; I will here shroud till the dregs of the storm be past.</line>

<line>Th&#8217; harmony of their tongues hath into bondage</line>
<line>Brought my too diligent ear. For several virtues</line>

<line>With so full soul but some defect in her</line>

<line>Servant-monster? The folly of this island! They say there&#8217;s but five upon this isle: we are three of them; if th&#8217; other two be brain&#8217;d like us, the state totters.</line>

<line>My man-monster hath drown&#8217;d his tongue in sack. For my part, the sea cannot drown me; I swam, ere I could recover the shore, five and thirty leagues off and on. By this light, thou shalt be my lieutenant, monster, or my standard.</line>

<line>Thou liest, most ignorant monster, I am in case to justle a constable. Why, thou debosh&#8217;d fish thou, was there ever man a coward that hath drunk so much sack as I today? Wilt thou tell a monstrous lie, being but half a fish and half a monster?</line>

<line>What a pied ninny&#8217;s this! Thou scurvy patch!</line>
<line>I do beseech thy greatness, give him blows,</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>STE.</speaker>
<line>Trinculo, run into no further danger; interrupt the monster one word further, and by this hand, I&#8217;ll turn my mercy out o&#8217; doors, and make a stock-fish of thee.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TRIN.</speaker>
<line>Why, what did I? I did nothing. I&#8217;ll go farther off.</line>

<stagedir>Beats Trinculo.</stagedir>
<line>As you like this, give me the lie another time.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TRIN.</speaker>
<line>I did not give the lie. Out o&#8217; your wits, and hearing too? A pox o&#8217; your bottle! This can sack and drinking do. A murrain on your monster, and the devil take your fingers!</line>

<line>Ha, ha, ha!</line>

<speech>
<speaker>CAL.</speaker>
<line>Why, as I told thee, &#8217;tis a custom with him</line>
<line>I&#8217; th&#8217; afternoon to sleep. There thou mayst brain him,</line>
<line>Having first seiz&#8217;d his books; or with a log</line>
<line>Batter his skull, or paunch him with a stake,</line>
<line>Or cut his wezand with thy knife. Remember</line>
<line>First to possess his books; for without them</line>
<line>He&#8217;s but a sot, as I am; nor hath not</line>
<line>One spirit to command: they all do hate him</line>
<line>As rootedly as I. Burn but his books.</line>
<line>He has brave utensils (for so he calls them)</line>
<line>Which when he has a house, he&#8217;ll deck withal.</line>
<line>And that most deeply to consider is</line>
<line>The beauty of his daughter. He himself</line>
<line>Calls her a nonpareil. I never saw a woman</line>
<line>But only Sycorax my dam and she;</line>
<line>But she as far surpasseth Sycorax</line>
<line>As great&#8217;st does least.</line>

<line>Ay, lord, she will become thy bed, I warrant,</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>STE.</speaker>
<line>Monster, I will kill this man. His daughter and I will be king and queen&#8212;&#8217;save our Graces! And Trinculo and thyself shall be viceroys. Dost thou like the plot, Trinculo?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TRIN.</speaker>
<line>Excellent.</line>

<line>Give me thy hand. I am sorry I beat thee; but while thou liv&#8217;st keep a good tongue in thy head.</line>
</speech>

<speech>

<line>Within this half hour will he be asleep.</line>
<line>Wilt thou destroy him then?</line>

<speech>
<speaker>CAL.</speaker>
<line>Thou mak&#8217;st me merry; I am full of pleasure,</line>
<line>Let us be jocund. Will you troll the catch</line>
<line>You taught me but while-ere?</line>
</speech>

<speech>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TRIN.</speaker>
<line>This is the tune of our catch, play&#8217;d by the picture of Nobody.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>STE.</speaker>
<line>If thou beest a man, show thyself in thy likeness. If thou beest a devil, take&#8217;t as thou list.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TRIN.</speaker>
<line>O, forgive me my sins!</line>
</speech>

<speech>

<line>He that dies pays all debts. I defy thee. Mercy upon us!</line>

<line>No, monster, not I.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>CAL.</speaker>
<line>Be not afeard, the isle is full of noises,</line>
<line>Sounds, and sweet airs, that give delight and hurt not.</line>
<line>Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments</line>
<line>Will hum about mine ears; and sometime voices,</line>
<line>That if I then had wak&#8217;d after long sleep,</line>
<line>Will make me sleep again, and then in dreaming,</line>
<line>The clouds methought would open, and show riches</line>
<line>Ready to drop upon me, that when I wak&#8217;d</line>
<line>I cried to dream again.</line>
</speech>

<line>Bravely the figure of this harpy hast thou</line>
<line>Perform&#8217;d, my Ariel; a grace it had, devouring.</line>
<line>Of my instruction hast thou nothing bated</line>
<line>In what thou hadst to say; so with good life,</line>
<line>And observation strange, my meaner ministers</line>
<line>Their several kinds have done. My high charms work,</line>
<line>And these, mine enemies, are all knit up</line>
<line>In their distractions. They now are in my pow&#8217;r;</line>

<line>The name of Prosper; it did base my trespass.</line>
<line>Therefore my son i&#8217; th&#8217; ooze is bedded; and</line>

<speaker>PROS.</speaker>
<line>If I have too austerely punish&#8217;d you,</line>
<line>Your compensation makes amends, for I</line>
<line>Have given you here a third of mine own life,</line>
<line>Or that for which I live; who once again</line>
<line>I tender to thy hand. All thy vexations</line>
<line>Were but my trials of thy love, and thou</line>
<line>Hast strangely stood the test. Here, afore heaven,</line>
<line>I ratify this my rich gift. O Ferdinand,</line>
<line>Do not smile at me that I boast her off,</line>

<line>All sanctimonious ceremonies may</line>
<line>With full and holy rite be minist&#8217;red,</line>
<line>No sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fall</line>
<line>To make this contract grow; but barren hate,</line>
<line>Sour-ey&#8217;d disdain, and discord shall bestrew</line>
<line>The union of your bed with weeds so loathly</line>

<line>You nymphs, call&#8217;d Naiades, of the windring brooks,</line>

<line>A contract of true love; be not too late.</line>

<stagedir>Enter certain Nymphs.</stagedir>
<line>You sunburn&#8217;d sicklemen, of August weary,</line>

<speaker>PROS.</speaker>
<stagedir>Aside.</stagedir>
<line>I had forgot that foul conspiracy</line>

<line>You do look, my son, in a mov&#8217;d sort,</line>
<line>As if you were dismay&#8217;d; be cheerful, sir.</line>
<line>Our revels now are ended. These our actors</line>
<line>(As I foretold you) were all spirits, and</line>

<line>And like the baseless fabric of this vision,</line>
<line>The cloud-capp&#8217;d tow&#8217;rs, the gorgeous palaces,</line>
<line>The solemn temples, the great globe itself,</line>
<line>Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve,</line>

<speaker>PROS.</speaker>
<line>Say again, where didst thou leave these varlots?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ARI.</speaker>
<line>I told you, sir, they were red-hot with drinking,</line>
<line>So full of valor that they smote the air</line>
<line>For breathing in their faces; beat the ground</line>
<line>For kissing of their feet; yet always bending</line>
<line>Towards their project. Then I beat my tabor,</line>
<line>At which like unback&#8217;d colts they prick&#8217;d their ears,</line>
<line>Advanc&#8217;d their eyelids, lifted up their noses</line>

<line>Tooth&#8217;d briers, sharp furzes, pricking goss, and thorns,</line>
<line>Which ent&#8217;red their frail shins. At last I left them</line>

<scenepersonae>(Prospero, Ariel, Alonso, Gonzalo, Sebastian, Antonio, Adrian, Francisco, Ferdinand, Miranda, Master, Boatswain, Caliban, Stephano, Trinculo)</scenepersonae>

<stagedir>Enter Prospero in his magic robes, and Ariel.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>PROS.</speaker>
<line>Now does my project gather to a head:</line>
<line>My charms crack not; my spirits obey; and Time</line>
<line>Goes upright with his carriage. How&#8217;s the day?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ARI.</speaker>
<line>On the sixt hour, at which time, my lord,</line>
<line>You said our work should cease.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PROS.</speaker>
<line offset="7">I did say so,</line>
<line>When first I rais&#8217;d the tempest. Say, my spirit,</line>
<line>How fares the King and &#8217;s followers?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ARI.</speaker>
<line offset="8">Confin&#8217;d together</line>
<line>In the same fashion as you gave in charge,</line>
<line>Just as you left them; all prisoners, sir,</line>
<line>In the line-grove which weather-fends your cell;</line>
<line>They cannot boudge till your release. The King,</line>
<line>His brother, and yours, abide all three distracted,</line>
<line>And the remainder mourning over them,</line>
<line>Brimful of sorrow and dismay; but chiefly</line>
<line>Him that you term&#8217;d, sir, &#8220;the good old Lord Gonzalo,&#8221;</line>
<line>His tears runs down his beard like winter&#8217;s drops</line>
<line>From eaves of reeds. Your charm so strongly works &#8217;em</line>
<line>That if you now beheld them, your affections</line>
<line>Would become tender.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PROS.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Dost thou think so, spirit?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ARI.</speaker>
<line>Mine would, sir, were I human.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PROS.</speaker>
<line offset="7">And mine shall.</line>
<line>Hast thou, which art but air, a touch, a feeling</line>
<line>Of their afflictions, and shall not myself,</line>
<line>One of their kind, that relish all as sharply</line>
<line>Passion as they, be kindlier mov&#8217;d than thou art?</line>
<line>Though with their high wrongs I am strook to th&#8217; quick,</line>
<line>Yet, with my nobler reason, &#8217;gainst my fury</line>
<line>Do I take part. The rarer action is</line>
<line>In virtue than in vengeance. They being penitent,</line>
<line>The sole drift of my purpose doth extend</line>
<line>Not a frown further. Go, release them, Ariel.</line>
<line>My charms I&#8217;ll break, their senses I&#8217;ll restore,</line>
<line>And they shall be themselves.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ARI.</speaker>
<line offset="6">I&#8217;ll fetch them, sir.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit. Prospero traces a magic circle with his staff.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>PROS.</speaker>
<line>Ye elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes, and groves,</line>
<line>And ye that on the sands with printless foot</line>
<line>Do chase the ebbing Neptune, and do fly him</line>
<line>When he comes back; you demi-puppets that</line>
<line>By moonshine do the green sour ringlets make,</line>
<line>Whereof the ewe not bites; and you whose pastime</line>
<line>Is to make midnight mushrumps, that rejoice</line>
<line>To hear the solemn curfew: by whose aid</line>
<line>(Weak masters though ye be) I have bedimm&#8217;d</line>
<line>The noontide sun, call&#8217;d forth the mutinous winds,</line>
<line>And &#8217;twixt the green sea and the azur&#8217;d vault</line>
<line>Set roaring war; to the dread rattling thunder</line>
<line>Have I given fire, and rifted Jove&#8217;s stout oak</line>
<line>With his own bolt; the strong-bas&#8217;d promontory</line>
<line>Have I made shake, and by the spurs pluck&#8217;d up</line>
<line>The pine and cedar. Graves at my command</line>
<line>Have wak&#8217;d their sleepers, op&#8217;d, and let &#8217;em forth</line>
<line>By my so potent art. But this rough magic</line>
<line>I here abjure; and when I have requir&#8217;d</line>
<line>Some heavenly music (which even now I do)</line>
<line>To work mine end upon their senses that</line>
<line>This airy charm is for, I&#8217;ll break my staff,</line>
<line>Bury it certain fathoms in the earth,</line>
<line>And deeper than did ever plummet sound</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll drown my book.</line>
<stagedir>Solemn music.</stagedir>
<stagedir>Here enters Ariel before; then Alonso, with a frantic gesture, attended by Gonzalo; Sebastian and Antonio in like manner, attended by Adrian and Francisco. They all enter the circle which Prospero had made, and there stand charm&#8217;d; which Prospero observing, speaks.</stagedir>
<line>A solemn air, and the best comforter</line>
<line>To an unsettled fancy, cure thy brains,</line>
<line>Now useless, boil&#8217;d within thy skull! There stand,</line>
<line>For you are spell-stopp&#8217;d.</line>
<line>Holy Gonzalo, honorable man,</line>
<line>Mine eyes, ev&#8217;n sociable to the show of thine,</line>
<line>Fall fellowly drops. The charm dissolves apace,</line>
<line>And as the morning steals upon the night,</line>
<line>Melting the darkness, so their rising senses</line>
<line>Begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle</line>
<line>Their clearer reason. O good Gonzalo,</line>
<line>My true preserver, and a loyal sir</line>
<line>To him thou follow&#8217;st! I will pay thy graces</line>
<line>Home both in word and deed. Most cruelly</line>
<line>Didst thou, Alonso, use me and my daughter;</line>
<line>Thy brother was a furtherer in the act.</line>
<line>Thou art pinch&#8217;d for&#8217;t now, Sebastian. Flesh and blood,</line>
<line>You, brother mine, that entertain&#8217;d ambition,</line>
<line>Expell&#8217;d remorse and nature, whom, with Sebastian</line>
<line>(Whose inward pinches therefore are most strong),</line>
<line>Would here have kill&#8217;d your king, I do forgive thee,</line>
<line>Unnatural though thou art.&#8212;Their understanding</line>
<line>Begins to swell, and the approaching tide</line>
<line>Will shortly fill the reasonable shores</line>
<line>That now lie foul and muddy. Not one of them</line>
<line>That yet looks on me, or would know me! Ariel,</line>
<line>Fetch me the hat and rapier in my cell.</line>

<stagedir>Exit Ariel, and returns immediately.</stagedir>
<line>I will discase me, and myself present</line>
<line>As I was sometime Milan. Quickly, spirit,</line>
<line>Thou shalt ere long be free.</line>

<line>Why, that&#8217;s my dainty Ariel! I shall miss thee,</line>
<line>But yet thou shalt have freedom. So, so, so.</line>
<line>To the King&#8217;s ship, invisible as thou art;</line>
<line>There shalt thou find the mariners asleep</line>
<line>Under the hatches. The master and the boatswain</line>
<line>Being awake, enforce them to this place;</line>
<line>And presently, I prithee.</line>
</speech>

<line>All torment, trouble, wonder, and amazement</line>

<speaker>PROS.</speaker>
<line offset="6">Behold, sir King,</line>
<line>The wronged Duke of Milan, Prospero.</line>
<line>For more assurance that a living prince</line>
<line>Does now speak to thee, I embrace thy body,</line>
<line>And to thee and thy company I bid</line>
<line>A hearty welcome.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ALON.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Whe&#8217;er thou beest he or no,</line>
<line>Or some enchanted trifle to abuse me</line>
<line>(As late I have been), I not know. Thy pulse</line>
<line>Beats as of flesh and blood; and since I saw thee,</line>
<line>Th&#8217; affliction of my mind amends, with which</line>
<line>I fear a madness held me. This must crave</line>
<line>(And if this be at all) a most strange story.</line>
<line>Thy dukedom I resign, and do entreat</line>
<line>Thou pardon me my wrongs. But how should Prospero</line>
<line>Be living, and be here?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PROS.</speaker>
<stagedir>To Gonzalo.</stagedir>
<line offset="5">First, noble friend,</line>
<line>Let me embrace thine age, whose honor cannot</line>
<line>Be measur&#8217;d or confin&#8217;d.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GON.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Whether this be,</line>
<line>Or be not, I&#8217;ll not swear.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PROS.</speaker>
<line offset="5">You do yet taste</line>
<line>Some subtleties o&#8217; th&#8217; isle, that will not let you</line>
<line>Believe things certain. Welcome, my friends all!</line>

<stagedir>Aside to Sebastian and Antonio.</stagedir>
<line>But you, my brace of lords, were I so minded,</line>
<line>I here could pluck his Highness&#8217; frown upon you</line>

<speaker>PROS.</speaker>
<line offset="10">No.</line>
<line>For you, most wicked sir, whom to call brother</line>
<line>Would even infect my mouth, I do forgive</line>
<line>Thy rankest fault&#8212;all of them; and require</line>
<line>My dukedom of thee, which perforce, I know</line>
<line>Thou must restore.</line>

<speaker>ALON.</speaker>
<line offset="4">If thou beest Prospero,</line>
<line>Give us particulars of thy preservation,</line>
<line>How thou hast met us here, whom three hours since</line>
<line>Were wrack&#8217;d upon this shore; where I have lost</line>
<line>(How sharp the point of this remembrance is!)</line>
<line>My dear son Ferdinand.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PROS.</speaker>
<line offset="5">I am woe for&#8217;t, sir.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ALON.</speaker>
<line>Irreparable is the loss, and patience</line>
<line>Says, it is past her cure.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PROS.</speaker>
<line offset="5">I rather think</line>
<line>You have not sought her help, of whose soft grace</line>
<line>For the like loss I have her sovereign aid,</line>
<line>And rest myself content.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ALON.</speaker>
<line offset="5">You the like loss?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PROS.</speaker>
<line>As great to me as late, and supportable</line>
<line>To make the dear loss, have I means much weaker</line>
<line>Than you may call to comfort you; for I</line>
<line>Have lost my daughter.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ALON.</speaker>
<line offset="5">A daughter?</line>
<line>O heavens, that they were living both in Naples,</line>
<line>The King and Queen there! That they were, I wish</line>
<line>Myself were mudded in that oozy bed</line>
<line>Where my son lies. When did you lose your daughter?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PROS.</speaker>
<line>In this last tempest. I perceive these lords</line>
<line>At this encounter do so much admire</line>
<line>That they devour their reason, and scarce think</line>
<line>Their eyes do offices of truth, their words</line>
<line>Are natural breath; but howsoev&#8217;r you have</line>
<line>Been justled from your senses, know for certain</line>
<line>That I am Prospero, and that very duke</line>
<line>Which was thrust forth of Milan, who most strangely</line>
<line>Upon this shore (where you were wrack&#8217;d) was landed,</line>
<line>To be the lord on&#8217;t. No more yet of this,</line>
<line>For &#8217;tis a chronicle of day by day,</line>
<line>Not a relation for a breakfast, nor</line>
<line>Befitting this first meeting. Welcome, sir;</line>
<line>This cell&#8217;s my court. Here have I few attendants,</line>
<line>And subjects none abroad. Pray you look in.</line>
<line>My dukedom since you have given me again,</line>
<line>I will requite you with as good a thing,</line>
<line>At least bring forth a wonder, to content ye</line>
<line>As much as me my dukedom.</line>

<line>What is this maid with whom thou wast at play?</line>
<line>Your eld&#8217;st acquaintance cannot be three hours.</line>
<line>Is she the goddess that hath sever&#8217;d us,</line>
<line>And brought us thus together?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FER.</speaker>
<line offset="6">Sir, she is mortal;</line>
<line>But by immortal Providence she&#8217;s mine.</line>
<line>I chose her when I could not ask my father</line>
<line>For his advice, nor thought I had one. She</line>
<line>Is daughter to this famous Duke of Milan,</line>
<line>Of whom so often I have heard renown,</line>
<line>But never saw before; of whom I have</line>
<line>Receiv&#8217;d a second life; and second father</line>
<line>This lady makes him to me.</line>
</speech>

<line>Was Milan thrust from Milan, that his issue</line>
<line>Should become kings of Naples? O, rejoice</line>
<line>Beyond a common joy, and set it down</line>
<line>With gold on lasting pillars: in one voyage</line>
<line>Did Claribel her husband find at Tunis,</line>
<line>And Ferdinand, her brother, found a wife</line>
<line>Where he himself was lost; Prospero, his dukedom</line>
<line>In a poor isle; and all of us, ourselves,</line>

<line>Our royal, good, and gallant ship; our master</line>

<line>I should have been a sore one then.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>ALON.</speaker>
<line>This is a strange thing as e&#8217;er I look&#8217;d on.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Pointing to Caliban.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>PROS.</speaker>
<line>He is as disproportion&#8217;d in his manners</line>
<line>As in his shape. Go, sirrah, to my cell;</line>
<line>Take with you your companions. As you look</line>
<line>To have my pardon, trim it handsomely.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CAL.</speaker>
<line>Ay, that I will; and I&#8217;ll be wise hereafter,</line>
<line>And seek for grace. What a thrice-double ass</line>
<line>Was I to take this drunkard for a god,</line>
<line>And worship this dull fool!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PROS.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Go to, away!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ALON.</speaker>
<line>Hence, and bestow your luggage where you found it.</line>

<speaker>SEB.</speaker>
<line>Or stole it, rather.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exeunt Caliban, Stephano, and Trinculo.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>PROS.</speaker>
<line>Sir, I invite your Highness and your train</line>
<line>To my poor cell, where you shall take your rest</line>
<line>For this one night; which, part of it, I&#8217;ll waste</line>
<line>With such discourse as, I not doubt, shall make it</line>
<line>Go quick away&#8212;the story of my life,</line>
<line>And the particular accidents gone by</line>
<line>Since I came to this isle. And in the morn</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll bring you to your ship, and so to Naples,</line>
<line>Where I have hope to see the nuptial</line>
<line>Of these our dear-belov&#8217;d solemnized,</line>
<line>And thence retire me to my Milan, where</line>
<line>Every third thought shall be my grave.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ALON.</speaker>
<line offset="8">I long</line>
<line>To hear the story of your life, which must</line>
<line>Take the ear strangely.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PROS.</speaker>
<line offset="5">I&#8217;ll deliver all,</line>
<line>And promise you calm seas, auspicious gales,</line>
<line>And sail so expeditious, that shall catch</line>
<line>Your royal fleet far off.</line>

<stagedir>Aside to Ariel.</stagedir>
<line offset="5">My Ariel, chick,</line>
<line>That is thy charge. Then to the elements</line>
<line>Be free, and fare thou well!&#8212;Please you draw near.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>PROS.</speaker>
<line type="lyric">Now my charms are all o&#8217;erthrown,</line>
<line type="lyric">And what strength I have&#8217;s mine own,</line>
<line type="lyric">Which is most faint. Now &#8217;tis true,</line>
<line type="lyric">I must be here confin&#8217;d by you,</line>
<line type="lyric">Or sent to Naples. Let me not,</line>
<line type="lyric">Since I have my dukedom got,</line>
<line type="lyric">And pardon&#8217;d the deceiver, dwell</line>
<line type="lyric">In this bare island by your spell,</line>
<line type="lyric">But release me from my bands</line>
<line type="lyric">With the help of your good hands.</line>
<line type="lyric">Gentle breath of yours my sails</line>
<line type="lyric">Must fill, or else my project fails,</line>
<line type="lyric">Which was to please. Now I want</line>
<line type="lyric">Spirits to enforce, art to enchant,</line>
<line type="lyric">And my ending is despair,</line>
<line type="lyric">Unless I be reliev&#8217;d by prayer,</line>
<line type="lyric">Which pierces so, that it assaults</line>
<line type="lyric">Mercy itself, and frees all faults.</line>
<line type="lyric">As you from crimes would pardon&#8217;d be,</line>
<line type="lyric">Let your indulgence set me free.</line>
