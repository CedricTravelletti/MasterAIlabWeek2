<scenepersonae>(Valentine, Proteus, Speed)</scenepersonae>

<stagedir>Enter Valentine, Proteus.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>Cease to persuade, my loving Proteus:</line>
<line>Home-keeping youth have ever homely wits.</line>
<line>Were&#8217;t not affection chains thy tender days</line>
<line>To the sweet glances of thy honor&#8217;d love,</line>
<line>I rather would entreat thy company,</line>
<line>To see the wonders of the world abroad,</line>
<line>Than (living dully sluggardiz&#8217;d at home)</line>
<line>Wear out thy youth with shapeless idleness.</line>
<line>But since thou lov&#8217;st, love still, and thrive therein,</line>
<line>Even as I would, when I to love begin.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRO.</speaker>
<line>Wilt thou be gone? Sweet Valentine, <french xml:lang="fr">adieu</french>,</line>
<line>Think on thy Proteus, when thou, happ&#8217;ly, seest</line>
<line>Some rare noteworthy object in thy travel.</line>
<line>Wish me partaker in thy happiness</line>
<line>When thou dost meet good hap; and in thy danger</line>
<line>(If ever danger do environ thee)</line>
<line>Commend thy grievance to my holy prayers,</line>
<line>For I will be thy beadsman, Valentine.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>And on a love-book pray for my success?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRO.</speaker>
<line>Upon some book I love I&#8217;ll pray for thee.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>That&#8217;s on some shallow story of deep love,</line>
<line>How young Leander cross&#8217;d the Hellespont.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRO.</speaker>
<line>That&#8217;s a deep story of a deeper love,</line>
<line>For he was more than over shoes in love.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>&#8217;Tis true; for you are over boots in love,</line>
<line>And yet you never swom the Hellespont.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRO.</speaker>
<line>Over the boots? Nay, give me not the boots.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>No, I will not; for it boots thee not.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRO.</speaker>
<line offset="7">What?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>To be in love&#8212;where scorn is bought with groans;</line>
<line>Coy looks with heart-sore sighs; one fading moment&#8217;s mirth</line>
<line>With twenty watchful, weary, tedious nights:</line>
<line>If happ&#8217;ly won, perhaps a hapless gain;</line>
<line>If lost, why then a grievous labor won;</line>
<line>However&#8212;but a folly bought with wit,</line>
<line>Or else a wit by folly vanquished.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRO.</speaker>
<line>So, by your circumstance, you call me fool.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>So, by your circumstance, I fear You&#8217;ll prove.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRO.</speaker>
<line>&#8217;Tis love you cavil at, I am not Love.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>Love is your master, for he masters you;</line>
<line>And he that is so yoked by a fool,</line>
<line>Methinks should not be chronicled for wise.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRO.</speaker>
<line>Yet writers say: as in the sweetest bud</line>
<line>The eating canker dwells, so eating love</line>
<line>Inhabits in the finest wits of all.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>And writers say: as the most forward bud</line>
<line>Is eaten by the canker ere it blow,</line>
<line>Even so by love the young and tender wit</line>
<line>Is turn&#8217;d to folly, blasting in the bud,</line>
<line>Losing his verdure, even in the prime,</line>
<line>And all the fair effects of future hopes.</line>
<line>But wherefore waste I time to counsel thee</line>
<line>That art a votary to fond desire?</line>
<line>Once more <french xml:lang="fr">adieu</french>. My father at the road</line>
<line>Expects my coming, there to see me shipp&#8217;d.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRO.</speaker>
<line>And thither will I bring thee, Valentine.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>Sweet Proteus, no; now let us take our leave.</line>
<line>To Milan let me hear from thee by letters</line>
<line>Of thy success in love, and what news else</line>
<line>Betideth here in absence of thy friend;</line>
<line>And I likewise will visit thee with mine.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRO.</speaker>
<line>All happiness bechance to thee in Milan.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>As much to you at home; and so farewell.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>PRO.</speaker>
<line>He after honor hunts, I after love:</line>
<line>He leaves his friends, to dignify them more;</line>
<line>I leave myself, my friends, and all, for love.</line>
<line>Thou, Julia, thou hast metamorphis&#8217;d me,</line>
<line>Made me neglect my studies, lose my time,</line>
<line>War with good counsel, set the world at nought;</line>
<line>Made wit with musing weak, heart sick with thought.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Speed.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line>Sir Proteus! &#8217;Save you! Saw you my master?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRO.</speaker>
<line>But now he parted hence to embark for Milan.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line>Twenty to one then he is shipp&#8217;d already,</line>
<line>And I have play&#8217;d the sheep in losing him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRO.</speaker>
<line>Indeed a sheep doth very often stray,</line>
<line>And if the shepherd be awhile away.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line>You conclude that my master is a shepherd then, and I a sheep?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRO.</speaker>
<line>I do.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line>Why then my horns are his horns, whether I wake or sleep.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRO.</speaker>
<line>A silly answer, and fitting well a sheep.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line>This proves me still a sheep.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRO.</speaker>
<line>True; and thy master a shepherd.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line>Nay, that I can deny by a circumstance.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRO.</speaker>
<line>It shall go hard but I&#8217;ll prove it by another.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line>The shepherd seeks the sheep, and not the sheep the shepherd; but I seek my master, and my master seeks not me: therefore I am no sheep.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRO.</speaker>
<line>The sheep for fodder follow the shepherd, the shepherd for food follows not the sheep; thou for wages followest thy master, thy master for wages follows not thee: therefore thou art a sheep.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line>Such another proof will make me cry &#8220;baa.&#8221;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRO.</speaker>
<line>But dost thou hear? Gav&#8217;st thou my letter to Julia?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line>Ay, sir; I (a lost mutton) gave your letter to her (a lac&#8217;d mutton), and she (a lac&#8217;d mutton) gave me (a lost mutton) nothing for my labor.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRO.</speaker>
<line>Here&#8217;s too small a pasture for such store of muttons.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line>If the ground be overcharg&#8217;d, you were best stick her.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRO.</speaker>
<line>Nay, in that you are astray; &#8217;twere best pound you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line>Nay, sir, less than a pound shall serve me for carrying your letter.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRO.</speaker>
<line>You mistake; I mean the pound&#8212;a pinfold.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line>From a pound to a pin? Fold it over and over,</line>
<line>&#8217;Tis threefold too little for carrying a letter to your lover.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRO.</speaker>
<line>But what said she?</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Speed nods, and Proteus looks at him questioningly.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line>Ay.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRO.</speaker>
<line>Nod-ay&#8212;why, that&#8217;s &#8220;noddy.&#8221;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line>You mistook, sir: I say, she did nod; and you ask me if she did nod, and I say, &#8220;Ay.&#8221;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRO.</speaker>
<line>And that set together is &#8220;noddy.&#8221;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line>Now you have taken the pains to set it together, take it for your pains.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRO.</speaker>
<line>No, no, you shall have it for bearing the letter.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line>Well, I perceive I must be fain to bear with you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRO.</speaker>
<line>Why, sir, how do you bear with me?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line>Marry, sir, the letter, very orderly, having nothing but the word &#8220;noddy&#8221; for my pains.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRO.</speaker>
<line>Beshrew me, but you have a quick wit.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line>And yet it cannot overtake your slow purse.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRO.</speaker>
<line>Come, come, open the matter in brief: what said she?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line>Open your purse, that the money and the matter may be both at once deliver&#8217;d.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRO.</speaker>
<line>Well, sir, here is for your pains. What said she?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line>Truly, sir, I think You&#8217;ll hardly win her.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRO.</speaker>
<line>Why? Couldst thou perceive so much from her?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line>Sir, I could perceive nothing at all from her; no, not so much as a ducat for delivering your letter: and being so hard to me that brought your mind, I fear she&#8217;ll prove as hard to you in telling your mind. Give her no token but stones, for she&#8217;s as hard as steel.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRO.</speaker>
<line>What said she? Nothing?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line>No, not so much as &#8220;Take this for thy pains.&#8221; To testify your bounty, I thank you, you have testern&#8217;d me; in requital whereof, henceforth carry your letters yourself: and so, sir, I&#8217;ll commend you to my master.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRO.</speaker>
<line>Go, go, be gone, to save your ship from wrack,</line>
<line>Which cannot perish having thee aboard,</line>
<line>Being destin&#8217;d to a drier death on shore.</line>

<stagedir>Exit Speed.</stagedir>
<line>I must go send some better messenger:</line>
<line>I fear my Julia would not deign my lines,</line>
<line>Receiving them from such a worthless post.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit</stagedir>

<scenetitle>Scene 2</scenetitle>
<scenelocation>The same. Garden of Julia&#8217;s house.</scenelocation>
<scenepersonae>(Julia, Lucetta)</scenepersonae>

<stagedir>Enter Julia and Lucetta.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>JUL.</speaker>
<line>But say, Lucetta, now we are alone,</line>
<line>Wouldst thou then counsel me to fall in love?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LUC.</speaker>
<line>Ay, madam, so you stumble not unheedfully.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JUL.</speaker>
<line>Of all the fair resort of gentlemen</line>
<line>That every day with parle encounter me,</line>
<line>In thy opinion which is worthiest love?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LUC.</speaker>
<line>Please you repeat their names, I&#8217;ll show my mind</line>
<line>According to my shallow simple skill.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JUL.</speaker>
<line>What think&#8217;st thou of the fair Sir Eglamour?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LUC.</speaker>
<line>As of a knight well-spoken, neat, and fine;</line>
<line>But were I you, he never should be mine.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JUL.</speaker>
<line>What think&#8217;st thou of the rich Mercatio?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LUC.</speaker>
<line>Well of his wealth; but of himself, so, so.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JUL.</speaker>
<line>What think&#8217;st thou of the gentle Proteus?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LUC.</speaker>
<line>Lord, Lord! To see what folly reigns in us!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JUL.</speaker>
<line>How now? What means this passion at his name?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LUC.</speaker>
<line>Pardon, dear madam, &#8217;tis a passing shame</line>
<line>That I (unworthy body as I am)</line>
<line>Should censure thus on lovely gentlemen.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JUL.</speaker>
<line>Why not on Proteus, as of all the rest?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LUC.</speaker>
<line>Then thus: of many good I think him best.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JUL.</speaker>
<line>Your reason?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LUC.</speaker>
<line>I have no other but a woman&#8217;s reason:</line>
<line>I think him so, because I think him so.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JUL.</speaker>
<line>And wouldst thou have me cast my love on him?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LUC.</speaker>
<line>Ay&#8212;if you thought your love not cast away.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JUL.</speaker>
<line>Why, he, of all the rest, hath never mov&#8217;d me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LUC.</speaker>
<line>Yet he, of all the rest, I think best loves ye.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JUL.</speaker>
<line>His little speaking shows his love but small.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LUC.</speaker>
<line>Fire that&#8217;s closest kept burns most of all.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JUL.</speaker>
<line>They do not love that do not show their love.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LUC.</speaker>
<line>O, they love least that let men know their love.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JUL.</speaker>
<line>I would I knew his mind.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LUC.</speaker>
<line>Peruse this paper, madam.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JUL.</speaker>
<line>&#8220;To Julia&#8221;&#8212;say, from whom?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LUC.</speaker>
<line>That the contents will show.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JUL.</speaker>
<line>Say, say; who gave it thee?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LUC.</speaker>
<line>Sir Valentine&#8217;s page; and sent, I think, from Proteus.</line>
<line>He would have given it you, but I, being in the way,</line>
<line>Did in your name receive it; pardon the fault, I pray.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JUL.</speaker>
<line>Now, by my modesty, a goodly broker!</line>
<line>Dare you presume to harbor wanton lines?</line>
<line>To whisper and conspire against my youth?</line>
<line>Now trust me, &#8217;tis an office of great worth,</line>
<line>And you an officer fit for the place.</line>
<line>There! Take the paper; see it be return&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Or else return no more into my sight.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LUC.</speaker>
<line>To plead for love deserves more fee than hate.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JUL.</speaker>
<line>Will ye be gone?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LUC.</speaker>
<line offset="3">That you may ruminate.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>JUL.</speaker>
<line>And yet I would I had o&#8217;erlook&#8217;d the letter;</line>
<line>It were a shame to call her back again,</line>
<line>And pray her to a fault for which I chid her.</line>
<line>What &#8217;fool is she, that knows I am a maid,</line>
<line>And would not force the letter to my view!</line>
<line>Since maids, in modesty, say &#8220;no&#8221; to that</line>
<line>Which they would have the profferer construe &#8220;ay.&#8221;</line>
<line>Fie, fie, how wayward is this foolish love,</line>
<line>That (like a testy babe) will scratch the nurse</line>
<line>And presently, all humbled, kiss the rod!</line>
<line>How churlishly I chid Lucetta hence,</line>
<line>When willingly I would have had her here!</line>
<line>How angerly I taught my brow to frown,</line>
<line>When inward joy enforc&#8217;d my heart to smile!</line>
<line>My penance is, to call Lucetta back</line>
<line>And ask remission for my folly past.</line>
<line>What ho! Lucetta!</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Lucetta.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>LUC.</speaker>
<line offset="4">What would your ladyship?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JUL.</speaker>
<line>Is&#8217;t near dinner-time?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LUC.</speaker>
<line offset="4">I would it were,</line>
<line>That you might kill your stomach on your meat,</line>
<line>And not upon your maid.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JUL.</speaker>
<line offset="5">What is&#8217;t that you</line>
<line>Took up so gingerly?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LUC.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Nothing.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JUL.</speaker>
<line offset="6">Why didst thou stoop then?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LUC.</speaker>
<line>To take a paper up that I let fall.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JUL.</speaker>
<line>And is that paper nothing?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LUC.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Nothing concerning me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JUL.</speaker>
<line>Then let it lie for those that it concerns.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LUC.</speaker>
<line>Madam, it will not lie where it concerns</line>
<line>Unless it have a false interpreter.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JUL.</speaker>
<line>Some love of yours hath writ to you in rhyme.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LUC.</speaker>
<line>That I might sing it, madam, to a tune:</line>
<line>Give me a note, your ladyship can set.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JUL.</speaker>
<line>As little by such toys as may be possible:</line>
<line>Best sing it to the tune of &#8220;Light o&#8217; love.&#8221;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LUC.</speaker>
<line>It is too heavy for so light a tune.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JUL.</speaker>
<line>Heavy? Belike it hath some burden then?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LUC.</speaker>
<line>Ay; and melodious were it, would you sing it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JUL.</speaker>
<line>And why not you?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LUC.</speaker>
<line offset="4">I cannot reach so high.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JUL.</speaker>
<line>Let&#8217;s see your song.</line>

<stagedir>Takes the letter.</stagedir>
<line offset="4">How now, minion?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LUC.</speaker>
<line>Keep tune there still, so you will sing it out.</line>
<line>And yet methinks I do not like this tune.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JUL.</speaker>
<line>You do not?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LUC.</speaker>
<line offset="3">No, madam, &#8217;tis too sharp.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JUL.</speaker>
<line>You, minion, are too saucy.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LUC.</speaker>
<line>Nay, now you are too flat,</line>
<line>And mar the concord with too harsh a descant:</line>
<line>There wanteth but a mean to fill your song.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JUL.</speaker>
<line>The mean is drown&#8217;d with your unruly bass.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LUC.</speaker>
<line>Indeed I bid the base for Proteus.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JUL.</speaker>
<line>This babble shall not henceforth trouble me.</line>
<line>Here is a coil with protestation!</line>

<stagedir>Tears the letter.</stagedir>
<line>Go, get you gone; and let the papers lie:</line>
<line>You would be fing&#8217;ring them, to anger me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LUC.</speaker>
<line>She makes it strange, but she would be best pleas&#8217;d</line>
<line>To be so ang&#8217;red with another letter.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>JUL.</speaker>
<line>Nay, would I were so ang&#8217;red with the same.</line>
<line>O hateful hands, to tear such loving words!</line>
<line>Injurious wasps, to feed on such sweet honey,</line>
<line>And kill the bees that yield it with your stings!</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll kiss each several paper for amends.</line>
<line>Look, here is writ &#8220;kind Julia.&#8221; Unkind Julia,</line>
<line>As in revenge of thy ingratitude,</line>
<line>I throw thy name against the bruising stones,</line>
<line>Trampling contemptuously on thy disdain.</line>
<line>And here is writ &#8220;love-wounded Proteus.&#8221;</line>
<line>Poor wounded name: my bosom as a bed</line>
<line>Shall lodge thee till thy wound be throughly heal&#8217;d;</line>
<line>And thus I search it with a sovereign kiss.</line>
<line>But twice, or thrice, was &#8220;Proteus&#8221; written down:</line>
<line>Be calm, good wind, blow not a word away</line>
<line>Till I have found each letter in the letter,</line>
<line>Except mine own name; that, some whirlwind bear</line>
<line>Unto a ragged, fearful, hanging rock,</line>
<line>And throw it thence into the raging sea.</line>
<line>Lo, here in one line is his name twice writ,</line>
<line>&#8220;Poor forlorn Proteus, passionate Proteus:</line>
<line>To the sweet Julia&#8221;&#8212;that I&#8217;ll tear away&#8212;</line>
<line>And yet I will not, sith so prettily</line>
<line>He couples it to his complaining names.</line>
<line>Thus will I fold them one upon another;</line>
<line>Now kiss, embrace, contend, do what you will.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Lucetta.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>JUL.</speaker>
<line>If you respect them, best to take them up.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>LUC.</speaker>
<line>Nay, I was taken up for laying them down;</line>

<line>Ay, madam, you may say what sights you see;</line>

<stagedir>Enter Antonio and Panthino.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>ANT.</speaker>
<line>Tell me, Panthino, what sad talk was that</line>
<line>Wherewith my brother held you in the cloister?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAN.</speaker>
<line>&#8217;Twas of his nephew Proteus, your son.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANT.</speaker>
<line>Why, what of him?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAN.</speaker>
<line offset="4">He wond&#8217;red that your lordship</line>
<line>Would suffer him to spend his youth at home,</line>
<line>While other men, of slender reputation,</line>
<line>Put forth their sons to seek preferment out:</line>
<line>Some to the wars, to try their fortune there;</line>
<line>Some to discover islands far away;</line>
<line>Some to the studious universities.</line>
<line>For any or for all these exercises</line>
<line>He said that Proteus, your son, was meet;</line>
<line>And did request me to importune you</line>
<line>To let him spend his time no more at home,</line>
<line>Which would be great impeachment to his age,</line>
<line>In having known no travel in his youth.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANT.</speaker>
<line>Nor need&#8217;st thou much importune me to that</line>
<line>Whereon this month I have been hammering.</line>
<line>I have consider&#8217;d well his loss of time,</line>
<line>And how he cannot be a perfect man,</line>
<line>Not being tried and tutor&#8217;d in the world:</line>
<line>Experience is by industry achiev&#8217;d,</line>
<line>And perfected by the swift course of time.</line>
<line>Then tell me, whither were I best to send him?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAN.</speaker>
<line>I think your lordship is not ignorant</line>
<line>How his companion, youthful Valentine,</line>
<line>Attends the Emperor in his royal court.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANT.</speaker>
<line>I know it well.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAN.</speaker>
<line>&#8217;Twere good, I think, your lordship sent him thither:</line>
<line>There shall he practice tilts and tournaments,</line>
<line>Hear sweet discourse, converse with noblemen,</line>
<line>And be in eye of every exercise</line>
<line>Worthy his youth and nobleness of birth.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANT.</speaker>
<line>I like thy counsel; well hast thou advis&#8217;d;</line>
<line>And that thou mayst perceive how well I like it,</line>
<line>The execution of it shall make known:</line>
<line>Even with the speediest expedition</line>
<line>I will dispatch him to the Emperor&#8217;s court.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAN.</speaker>
<line>Tomorrow, may it please you, Don Alphonso</line>
<line>With other gentlemen of good esteem</line>
<line>Are journeying to salute the Emperor,</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANT.</speaker>
<line>Good company; with them shall Proteus go&#8212;</line>

<stagedir>Enter Proteus.</stagedir>
<line>And in good time! Now will we break with him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRO.</speaker>
<line>Sweet love, sweet lines, sweet life!</line>
<line>Here is her hand, the agent of her heart;</line>
<line>Here is her oath for love, her honor&#8217;s pawn:</line>
<line>O that our fathers would applaud our loves,</line>
<line>To seal our happiness with their consents!</line>
<line>O heavenly Julia!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANT.</speaker>
<line>How now? What letter are you reading there?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRO.</speaker>
<line>May&#8217;t please your lordship, &#8217;tis a word or two</line>
<line>Of commendations sent from Valentine,</line>
<line>Deliver&#8217;d by a friend that came from him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANT.</speaker>
<line>Lend me the letter; let me see what news.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRO.</speaker>
<line>There is no news, my lord, but that he writes</line>
<line>How happily he lives, how well-belov&#8217;d</line>
<line>And daily graced by the Emperor;</line>
<line>Wishing me with him, partner of his fortune.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANT.</speaker>
<line>And how stand you affected to his wish?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRO.</speaker>
<line>As one relying on your lordship&#8217;s will,</line>
<line>And not depending on his friendly wish.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANT.</speaker>
<line>My will is something sorted with his wish:</line>
<line>Muse not that I thus suddenly proceed;</line>
<line>For what I will, I will, and there an end.</line>
<line>I am resolv&#8217;d that thou shalt spend some time</line>
<line>With Valentinus in the Emperor&#8217;s court;</line>
<line>What maintenance he from his friends receives,</line>
<line>Like exhibition thou shalt have from me.</line>
<line>Tomorrow be in readiness to go&#8212;</line>
<line>Excuse it not, for I am peremptory.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRO.</speaker>
<line>My lord I cannot be so soon provided:</line>
<line>Please you deliberate a day or two.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ANT.</speaker>
<line>Look what thou want&#8217;st shall be sent after thee.</line>
<line>No more of stay: tomorrow thou must go.</line>
<line>Come on, Panthino; you shall be employ&#8217;d</line>
<line>To hasten on his expedition.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exeunt Antonio and Panthino.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>PRO.</speaker>
<line>Thus have I shunn&#8217;d the fire for fear of burning,</line>
<line>And drench&#8217;d me in the sea, where I am drown&#8217;d.</line>
<line>I fear&#8217;d to show my father Julia&#8217;s letter,</line>
<line>Lest he should take exceptions to my love,</line>
<line>And with the vantage of mine own excuse</line>
<line>Hath he excepted most against my love.</line>
<line>O, how this spring of love resembleth</line>
<line>The uncertain glory of an April day,</line>
<line>Which now shows all the beauty of the sun,</line>
<line>And by and by a cloud takes all away.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Panthino.</stagedir>

<speech>

<line>Sir Proteus, your father calls for you:</line>
<line>He is in haste; therefore I pray you go.</line>

<line>Sir, your glove.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line offset="3">Not mine: my gloves are on.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line>Why then this may be yours&#8212;for this is but one.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>Ha? Let me see; ay, give it me, it&#8217;s mine:</line>
<line>Sweet ornament that decks a thing divine&#8212;</line>
<line>Ah, Silvia, Silvia!</line>

</speech>

<speech>

<line>How now, sirrah?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line>She is not within hearing, sir.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>Why, sir, who bade you call her?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line>Your worship, sir, or else I mistook.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>Well&#8212;You&#8217;ll still be too forward.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line>And yet I was last chidden for being too slow.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>Go to, sir; tell me, do you know Madam Silvia?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line>She that your worship loves?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>Why, how know you that I am in love?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line>Marry, by these special marks: first, you have learn&#8217;d, like Sir Proteus, to wreathe your arms, like a malecontent; to relish a love-song, like a robin-redbreast; to walk alone, like one that had the pestilence; to sigh, like a schoolboy that had lost his A B C; to weep, like a young wench that had buried her grandam; to fast, like one that takes diet; to watch, like one that fears robbing; to speak puling, like a beggar at Hallowmas. You were wont, when you laugh&#8217;d, to crow like a cock; when you walk&#8217;d, to walk like one of the lions; when you fasted, it was presently after dinner; when you look&#8217;d sadly, it was for want of money: and now you are metamorphis&#8217;d with a mistress, that when I look on you, I can hardly think you my master.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>Are all these things perceiv&#8217;d in me?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line>They are all perceiv&#8217;d without ye.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>Without me? They cannot.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line>Without you? Nay, that&#8217;s certain; for without you were so simple, none else would: but you are so without these follies, that these follies are within you, and shine through you like the water in an urinal, that not an eye that sees you but is a physician to comment on your malady.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>But tell me: dost thou know my lady Silvia?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line>She that you gaze on so as she sits at supper?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>Hast thou observ&#8217;d that? Even she I mean.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line>Why, sir, I know her not.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>Dost thou know her by my gazing on her, and yet know&#8217;st her not?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line>Is she not hard-favor&#8217;d, sir?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>Not so fair, boy, as well-favor&#8217;d.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line>Sir, I know that well enough.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>What dost thou know?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line>That she is not so fair as (of you) well favor&#8217;d.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>I mean that her beauty is exquisite, but her favor infinite.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line>That&#8217;s because the one is painted, and the other out of all count.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>How painted? And how out of count?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line>Marry, sir, so painted to make her fair, that no man counts of her beauty.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>How esteem&#8217;st thou me? I account of her beauty.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line>You never saw her since she was deform&#8217;d.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>How long hath she been deform&#8217;d?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line>Ever since you lov&#8217;d her.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>I have lov&#8217;d her ever since I saw her, and still I see her beautiful.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line>If you love her, you cannot see her.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>Why?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line>Because Love is blind. O that you had mine eyes, or your own eyes had the lights they were wont to have when you chid at Sir Proteus for going ungarter&#8217;d!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>What should I see then?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line>Your own present folly, and her passing deformity: for he, being in love, could not see to garter his hose; and you, being in love, cannot see to put on your hose.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>Belike, boy, then you are in love&#8212;for last morning you could not see to wipe my shoes.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line>True, sir; I was in love with my bed. I thank you, you swing&#8217;d me for my love, which makes me the bolder to chide you for yours.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>In conclusion, I stand affected to her.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line>I would you were set, so your affection would cease.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>Last night she enjoin&#8217;d me to write some lines to one she loves.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line>And have you?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>I have.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line>Are they not lamely writ?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>No, boy, but as well as I can do them.</line>

<stagedir>Enter Silvia.</stagedir>
<line>Peace, here she comes.</line>

<line>Madam and mistress, a thousand good morrows.</line>

<line> O, give ye good ev&#8217;n! Here&#8217;s a million of manners.</line>

<speaker>SIL.</speaker>
<line>Sir Valentine and servant, to you two thousand.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<stagedir>Aside.</stagedir>
<line> He should give her interest, and she gives it him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>As you enjoin&#8217;d me, I have writ your letter</line>
<line>Unto the secret, nameless friend of yours;</line>
<line>Which I was much unwilling to proceed in,</line>
<line>But for my duty to your ladyship.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIL.</speaker>
<line>I thank you, gentle servant&#8212;&#8217;tis very clerkly done.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>Now trust me, madam, it came hardly off;</line>
<line>For being ignorant to whom it goes,</line>
<line>I writ at random, very doubtfully.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIL.</speaker>
<line>Perchance you think too much of so much pains?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>No, madam; so it stead you, I will write</line>
<line>(Please you command) a thousand times as much;</line>
<line>And yet&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIL.</speaker>
<line>A pretty period! Well&#8212;I guess the sequel;</line>
<line>And yet I will not name it&#8212;and yet I care not&#8212;</line>
<line>And yet take this again&#8212;and yet I thank you&#8212;</line>
<line>Meaning henceforth to trouble you no more.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<stagedir>Aside.</stagedir>
<line>And yet you will; and yet another &#8220;yet.&#8221;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>What means your ladyship? Do you not like it?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIL.</speaker>
<line>Yes, yes; the lines are very quaintly writ,</line>
<line>But (since unwillingly) take them again.</line>
<line>Nay, take them.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>Madam, they are for you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIL.</speaker>
<line>Ay, ay; you writ them, sir, at my request,</line>
<line>But I will none of them; they are for you.</line>
<line>I would have had them writ more movingly.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>Please you, I&#8217;ll write your ladyship another.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIL.</speaker>
<line>And when it&#8217;s writ, for my sake read it over,</line>
<line>And if it please you, so; if not, why, so.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>If it please me, madam, what then?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIL.</speaker>
<line>Why, if it please you, take it for your labor;</line>
<line>And so good morrow, servant.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit Silvia.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line>O jest unseen, inscrutable; invisible,</line>
<line>As a nose on a man&#8217;s face, or a weathercock on a steeple!</line>
<line>My master sues to her; and she hath taught her suitor,</line>
<line>He being her pupil, to become her tutor.</line>
<line>O excellent device, was there ever heard a better,</line>
<line>That my master being scribe, to himself should write the letter?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>How now, sir? What are you reasoning with yourself?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line>Nay, I was rhyming; &#8217;tis you that have the reason.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>To do what?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line>To be a spokesman from Madam Silvia.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>To whom?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line>To yourself; why, she woos you by a figure.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>What figure?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line>By a letter, I should say.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>Why, she hath not writ to me?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line>What need she, when she hath made you write to yourself? Why, do you not perceive the jest?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>No, believe me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line>No believing you indeed, sir: but did you perceive her earnest?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>She gave me none, except an angry word.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line>Why, she hath given you a letter.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>That&#8217;s the letter I writ to her friend.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line>And that letter hath she deliver&#8217;d, and there an end.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>I would it were no worse.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line>I&#8217;ll warrant you, &#8217;tis as well:</line>
<line>&#8220;For often have you writ to her; and she in modesty,</line>
<line>Or else for want of idle time, could not again reply;</line>
<line>Or fearing else some messenger, that might her mind discover,</line>
<line>Herself hath taught her love himself to write unto her lover.&#8221;</line>
<line>All this I speak in print, for in print I found it. Why muse you, sir? &#8217;Tis dinner-time.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>I have din&#8217;d.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line>Ay, but hearken, sir; though the chameleon Love can feed on the air, I am one that am nourish&#8217;d by my victuals, and would fain have meat. O, be not like your mistress&#8212;be mov&#8217;d, be mov&#8217;d.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>LAUNCE.</speaker>
<line>Nay, &#8217;twill be this hour ere I have done weeping; all the kind of the Launces have this very fault. I have receiv&#8217;d my proportion, like the prodigious son, and am going with Sir Proteus to the Imperial&#8217;s court. I think Crab my dog be the sourest-natur&#8217;d dog that lives: my mother weeping, my father wailing, my sister crying, our maid howling, our cat wringing her hands, and all our house in a great perplexity, yet did not this cruel-hearted cur shed one tear. He is a stone, a very pibble stone, and has no more pity in him than a dog. A Jew would have wept to have seen our parting; why, my grandam, having no eyes, look you, wept herself blind at my parting. Nay, I&#8217;ll show you the manner of it. This shoe is my father; no, this left shoe is my father; no, no, this left shoe is my mother; nay, that cannot be so neither; yes, it is so, it is so&#8212;it hath the worser sole. This shoe, with the hole in it, is my mother, and this my father&#8212;a vengeance on&#8217;t! There &#8217;tis. Now, sir, this staff is my sister, for, look you, she is as white as a lily and as small as a wand. This hat is Nan, our maid. I am the dog&#8212;no, the dog is himself, and I am the dog&#8212;O! The dog is me, and I am myself; ay, so, so. Now come I to my father: &#8220;Father, your blessing.&#8221; Now should not the shoe speak a word for weeping; now should I kiss my father; well, he weeps on. Now come I to my mother. O that she could speak now like a wood woman! Well, I kiss her; why, there &#8217;tis; here&#8217;s my mother&#8217;s breath up and down. Now come I to my sister; mark the moan she makes. Now the dog all this while sheds not a tear, nor speaks a word; but see how I lay the dust with my tears.</line>

<line>Launce, away, away! Aboard! Thy master is shipp&#8217;d, and thou art to post after with oars. What&#8217;s the matter? Why weep&#8217;st thou, man? Away, ass, You&#8217;ll lose the tide, if you tarry any longer.</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIL.</speaker>
<line>What, angry, Sir Thurio? Do you change color?</line>
</speech>

<speech>

<line>Give him leave, madam, he is a kind of chameleon.</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIL.</speaker>
<line>Who is that, servant?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>Yourself, sweet lady, for you gave the fire. Sir Thurio borrows his wit from your ladyship&#8217;s looks, and spends what he borrows kindly in your company.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>THU.</speaker>
<line>Sir, if you spend word for word with me, I shall make your wit bankrupt.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>I know it well, sir; you have an exchequer of words and, I think, no other treasure to give your followers; for it appears by their bare liveries that they live by your bare words.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>Ay, my good lord, I know the gentleman</line>
<line>To be of worth and worthy estimation,</line>
<line>And not without desert so well reputed.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
<line>Hath he not a son?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>Ay, my good lord, a son that well deserves</line>
<line>The honor and regard of such a father.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
<line>You know him well?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>I knew him as myself: for from our infancy</line>
<line>We have convers&#8217;d and spent our hours together,</line>
<line>And though myself have been an idle truant,</line>
<line>Omitting the sweet benefit of time</line>
<line>To clothe mine age with angel-like perfection,</line>
<line>Yet hath Sir Proteus (for that&#8217;s his name)</line>
<line>Made use and fair advantage of his days;</line>
<line>His years but young, but his experience old;</line>
<line>His head unmellowed, but his judgment ripe;</line>
<line>And in a word (for far behind his worth</line>
<line>Comes all the praises that I now bestow),</line>
<line>He is complete in feature and in mind</line>
<line>With all good grace to grace a gentleman.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
<line>Beshrew me, sir, but if he make this good,</line>
<line>He is as worthy for an empress&#8217; love</line>
<line>As meet to be an emperor&#8217;s counsellor.</line>
<line>Well, sir&#8212;this gentleman is come to me</line>
<line>With commendation from great potentates,</line>
<line>And here he means to spend his time a while.</line>
<line>I think &#8217;tis no unwelcome news to you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>Should I have wish&#8217;d a thing, it had been he.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
<line>Welcome him then according to his worth&#8212;</line>
<line>Silvia, I speak to you, and you, Sir Thurio;</line>

<line>I will send him hither to you presently.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>This is the gentleman I told your ladyship</line>
<line>Had come along with me, but that his mistress</line>
<line>Did hold his eyes lock&#8217;d in her crystal looks.</line>
</speech>

<speaker>SIL.</speaker>
<line>Belike that now she hath enfranchis&#8217;d them</line>

<line>Nay sure, I think she holds them prisoners still.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIL.</speaker>
<line>Nay then he should be blind, and being blind,</line>
<line>How could he see his way to seek out you?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>Why, lady, Love hath twenty pair of eyes.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>THU.</speaker>
<line>They say that Love hath not an eye at all.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>To see such lovers, Thurio, as yourself:</line>
<line>Upon a homely object Love can wink.</line>

<line>Mistress, it is: sweet lady, entertain him</line>

<line>Too low a mistress for so high a servant.</line>

<line>Sweet lady, entertain him for your servant.</line>

<line>How does your lady, and how thrives your love?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRO.</speaker>
<line>My tales of love were wont to weary you;</line>
<line>I know you joy not in a love-discourse.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>Ay, Proteus, but that life is alter&#8217;d now:</line>
<line>I have done penance for contemning Love,</line>
<line>Whose high imperious thoughts have punish&#8217;d me</line>
<line>With bitter fasts, with penitential groans,</line>
<line>With nightly tears, and daily heart-sore sighs,</line>
<line>For in revenge of my contempt of love,</line>
<line>Love hath chas&#8217;d sleep from my enthralled eyes,</line>
<line>And made them watchers of mine own heart&#8217;s sorrow.</line>
<line>O gentle Proteus, Love&#8217;s a mighty lord,</line>
<line>And hath so humbled me as I confess</line>
<line>There is no woe to his correction,</line>
<line>Nor to his service no such joy on earth:</line>
<line>Now no discourse, except it be of love;</line>
<line>Now can I break my fast, dine, sup, and sleep,</line>
<line>Upon the very naked name of love.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRO.</speaker>
<line>Enough; I read your fortune in your eye.</line>
<line>Was this the idol that you worship so?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>Even she; and is she not a heavenly saint?</line>

<line>When I was sick, you gave me bitter pills,</line>
<line>And I must minister the like to you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>Then speak the truth by her; if not divine,</line>
<line>Yet let her be a principality,</line>
<line>Sovereign to all the creatures on the earth.</line>

<speech>

<line>Have I not reason to prefer mine own?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>And I will help thee to prefer her too:</line>
<line>She shall be dignified with this high honor&#8212;</line>
<line>To bear my lady&#8217;s train, lest the base earth</line>
<line>Should from her vesture chance to steal a kiss,</line>
<line>And of so great a favor growing proud,</line>
<line>Disdain to root the summer-swelling flow&#8217;r,</line>
<line>And make rough winter everlastingly.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRO.</speaker>
<line>Why, Valentine, what braggadism is this?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>Pardon me, Proteus, all I can is nothing</line>
<line>To her, whose worth makes other worthies nothing:</line>
<line>She is alone.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRO.</speaker>
<line offset="3">Then let her alone.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>Not for the world. Why, man, she is mine own,</line>

<line>As twenty seas, if all their sand were pearl,</line>
<line>The water nectar, and the rocks pure gold.</line>
<line>Forgive me, that I do not dream on thee,</line>

<line>My foolish rival, that her father likes</line>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>Ay, and we are betroth&#8217;d: nay more, our marriage hour,</line>
<line>With all the cunning manner of our flight,</line>
<line>Determin&#8217;d of&#8212;how I must climb her window,</line>
<line>The ladder made of cords, and all the means</line>

<line>Good Proteus, go with me to my chamber,</line>

<line>I will.</line>

<stagedir>Exit Valentine.</stagedir>
<line>Even as one heat another heat expels,</line>
<line>Or as one nail by strength drives out another,</line>
<line>So the remembrance of my former love</line>
<line>Is by a newer object quite forgotten.</line>
<line>Is it mine eye, or Valentinus&#8217; praise,</line>
<line>Her true perfection, or my false transgression,</line>
<line>That makes me reasonless, to reason thus?</line>
<line>She is fair; and so is Julia that I love</line>
<line>(That I did love, for now my love is thaw&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Which like a waxen image &#8217;gainst a fire</line>
<line>Bears no impression of the thing it was).</line>
<line>Methinks my zeal to Valentine is cold,</line>
<line>And that I love him not as I was wont:</line>
<line>O, but I love his lady too too much,</line>
<line>And that&#8217;s the reason I love him so little.</line>
<line>How shall I dote on her with more advice,</line>
<line>That thus without advice begin to love her?</line>
<line>&#8217;Tis but her picture I have yet beheld,</line>
<line>And that hath dazzled my reason&#8217;s light;</line>
<line>But when I look on her perfections,</line>
<line>There is no reason but I shall be blind.</line>

<line>Ask my dog. If he say ay, it will; if he say no, it will; if he shake his tail and say nothing, it will.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line>The conclusion is then, that it will.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LAUNCE.</speaker>
<line>Thou shalt never get such a secret from me but by a parable.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line>&#8217;Tis well that I get it so. But, Launce, how say&#8217;st thou that my master is become a notable lover?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LAUNCE.</speaker>
<line>I never knew him otherwise.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line>Than how?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LAUNCE.</speaker>
<line>A notable lubber&#8212;as thou reportest him to be.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line>Why, thou whoreson ass, thou mistak&#8217;st me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LAUNCE.</speaker>
<line>Why, fool, I meant not thee, I meant thy master.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line>I tell thee, my master is become a hot lover.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LAUNCE.</speaker>
<line>Why, I tell thee, I care not, though he burn himself in love. If thou wilt, go with me to the alehouse; if not, thou art an Hebrew, a Jew, and not worth the name of a Christian.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line>Why?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LAUNCE.</speaker>
<line>Because thou hast not so much charity in thee as to go to the ale with a Christian. Wilt thou go?</line>
</speech>

<speech>

<line>To leave my Julia&#8212;shall I be forsworn?</line>
<line>To love fair Silvia&#8212;shall I be forsworn?</line>
<line>To wrong my friend, I shall be much forsworn.</line>
<line>And ev&#8217;n that pow&#8217;r which gave me first my oath</line>
<line>Provokes me to this threefold perjury.</line>
<line>Love bade me swear, and Love bids me forswear.</line>
<line>O sweet-suggesting Love, if thou hast sinn&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Teach me, thy tempted subject, to excuse it!</line>
<line>At first I did adore a twinkling star,</line>
<line>But now I worship a celestial sun.</line>
<line>Unheedful vows may heedfully be broken,</line>
<line>And he wants wit that wants resolved will</line>
<line>To learn his wit t&#8217; exchange the bad for better.</line>
<line>Fie, fie, unreverend tongue, to call her bad,</line>
<line>Whose sovereignty so oft thou hast preferr&#8217;d</line>
<line>With twenty thousand soul-confirming oaths.</line>
<line>I cannot leave to love, and yet I do;</line>
<line>But there I leave to love where I should love.</line>
<line>Julia I lose, and Valentine I lose:</line>
<line>If I keep them, I needs must lose myself;</line>
<line>If I lose them, thus find I by their loss&#8212;</line>
<line>For Valentine, myself; for Julia, Silvia.</line>
<line>I to myself am dearer than a friend,</line>
<line>For love is still most precious in itself,</line>
<line>And Silvia (witness heaven, that made her fair)</line>
<line>Shows Julia but a swarthy Ethiope.</line>
<line>I will forget that Julia is alive,</line>
<line>Rememb&#8217;ring that my love to her is dead;</line>
<line>And Valentine I&#8217;ll hold an enemy,</line>
<line>Aiming at Silvia as a sweeter friend.</line>
<line>I cannot now prove constant to myself,</line>
<line>Without some treachery us&#8217;d to Valentine.</line>
<line>This night he meaneth with a corded ladder</line>
<line>To climb celestial Silvia&#8217;s chamber-window,</line>
<line>Myself in counsel his competitor.</line>
<line>Now presently I&#8217;ll give her father notice</line>
<line>Of their disguising and pretended flight,</line>
<line>Who, all enrag&#8217;d, will banish Valentine;</line>
<line>For Thurio, he intends, shall wed his daughter;</line>
<line>But, Valentine being gone, I&#8217;ll quickly cross</line>
<line>By some sly trick blunt Thurio&#8217;s dull proceeding.</line>
<line>Love, lend me wings to make my purpose swift,</line>

<speaker>JUL.</speaker>
<line>Counsel, Lucetta; gentle girl, assist me;</line>
<line>And ev&#8217;n in kind love I do conjure thee,</line>
<line>Who art the table wherein all my thoughts</line>
<line>Are visibly character&#8217;d and engrav&#8217;d,</line>
<line>To lesson me and tell me some good mean</line>
<line>How with my honor I may undertake</line>
<line>A journey to my loving Proteus.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LUC.</speaker>
<line>Alas, the way is wearisome and long.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JUL.</speaker>
<line>A true-devoted pilgrim is not weary</line>
<line>To measure kingdoms with his feeble steps;</line>
<line>Much less shall she that hath Love&#8217;s wings to fly,</line>
<line>And when the flight is made to one so dear,</line>
<line>Of such divine perfection, as Sir Proteus.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LUC.</speaker>
<line>Better forbear till Proteus make return.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JUL.</speaker>
<line>O, know&#8217;st thou not his looks are my soul&#8217;s food?</line>
<line>Pity the dearth that I have pined in,</line>
<line>By longing for that food so long a time.</line>
<line>Didst thou but know the inly touch of love,</line>
<line>Thou wouldst as soon go kindle fire with snow</line>
<line>As seek to quench the fire of love with words.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LUC.</speaker>
<line>I do not seek to quench your love&#8217;s hot fire,</line>
<line>But qualify the fire&#8217;s extreme rage,</line>
<line>Lest it should burn above the bounds of reason.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JUL.</speaker>
<line>The more thou dam&#8217;st it up, the more it burns:</line>
<line>The current that with gentle murmur glides,</line>
<line>Thou know&#8217;st, being stopp&#8217;d, impatiently doth rage;</line>
<line>But when his fair course is not hindered,</line>
<line>He makes sweet music with th&#8217; enamell&#8217;d stones,</line>
<line>Giving a gentle kiss to every sedge</line>
<line>He overtaketh in his pilgrimage;</line>
<line>And so by many winding nooks he strays</line>
<line>With willing sport to the wild ocean.</line>
<line>Then let me go, and hinder not my course:</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll be as patient as a gentle stream,</line>
<line>And make a pastime of each weary step,</line>
<line>Till the last step have brought me to my love,</line>
<line>And there I&#8217;ll rest, as after much turmoil</line>
<line>A blessed soul doth in Elysium.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LUC.</speaker>
<line>But in what habit will you go along?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JUL.</speaker>
<line>Not like a woman, for I would prevent</line>
<line>The loose encounters of lascivious men:</line>
<line>Gentle Lucetta, fit me with such weeds</line>
<line>As may beseem some well-reputed page.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LUC.</speaker>
<line>Why then your ladyship must cut your hair.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JUL.</speaker>
<line>No, girl, I&#8217;ll knit it up in silken strings,</line>
<line>With twenty odd-conceited true-love knots:</line>
<line>To be fantastic may become a youth</line>
<line>Of greater time than I shall show to be.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LUC.</speaker>
<line>What fashion, madam, shall I make your breeches?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JUL.</speaker>
<line>That fits as well as &#8220;Tell me, good my lord,</line>
<line>What compass will you wear your farthingale?&#8221;</line>
<line>Why, ev&#8217;n what fashion thou best likes, Lucetta.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LUC.</speaker>
<line>You must needs have them with a codpiece, madam.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JUL.</speaker>
<line>Out, out, Lucetta, that will be ill-favor&#8217;d.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LUC.</speaker>
<line>A round hose, madam, now&#8217;s not worth a pin,</line>
<line>Unless you have a codpiece to stick pins on.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JUL.</speaker>
<line>Lucetta, as thou lov&#8217;st me, let me have</line>
<line>What thou think&#8217;st meet, and is most mannerly.</line>
<line>But tell me, wench, how will the world repute me</line>
<line>For undertaking so unstaid a journey?</line>
<line>I fear me it will make me scandaliz&#8217;d.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LUC.</speaker>
<line>If you think so, then stay at home and go not.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JUL.</speaker>
<line>Nay, that I will not.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LUC.</speaker>
<line>Then never dream on infamy, but go.</line>
<line>If Proteus like your journey when you come,</line>
<line>No matter who&#8217;s displeas&#8217;d when you are gone:</line>
<line>I fear me he will scarce be pleas&#8217;d withal.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JUL.</speaker>
<line>That is the least, Lucetta, of my fear:</line>
<line>A thousand oaths, an ocean of his tears,</line>
<line>And instances of infinite of love,</line>
<line>Warrant me welcome to my Proteus.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LUC.</speaker>
<line>All these are servants to deceitful men.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JUL.</speaker>
<line>Base men, that use them to so base effect!</line>
<line>But truer stars did govern Proteus&#8217; birth:</line>
<line>His words are bonds, his oaths are oracles,</line>
<line>His love sincere, his thoughts immaculate,</line>
<line>His tears pure messengers sent from his heart,</line>
<line>His heart as far from fraud as heaven from earth.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LUC.</speaker>
<line>Pray heav&#8217;n he prove so when you come to him!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JUL.</speaker>
<line>Now, as thou lov&#8217;st me, do him not that wrong,</line>
<line>To bear a hard opinion of his truth:</line>
<line>Only deserve my love by loving him,</line>
<line>And presently go with me to my chamber,</line>
<line>To take a note of what I stand in need of,</line>
<line>To furnish me upon my longing journey.</line>
<line>All that is mine I leave at thy dispose,</line>
<line>My goods, my lands, my reputation;</line>

<stagedir>Enter Duke, Thurio, Proteus.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
<line>Sir Thurio, give us leave, I pray, a while,</line>
<line>We have some secrets to confer about.</line>

<stagedir>Exit Thurio.</stagedir>
<line>Now tell me, Proteus, what&#8217;s your will with me?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRO.</speaker>
<line>My gracious lord, that which I would discover</line>
<line>The law of friendship bids me to conceal,</line>
<line>But when I call to mind your gracious favors</line>
<line>Done to me (undeserving as I am),</line>
<line>My duty pricks me on to utter that</line>
<line>Which else no worldly good should draw from me.</line>
<line>Know, worthy prince, Sir Valentine, my friend,</line>
<line>This night intends to steal away your daughter;</line>
<line>Myself am one made privy to the plot.</line>
<line>I know you have determin&#8217;d to bestow her</line>
<line>On Thurio, whom your gentle daughter hates,</line>
<line>And should she thus be stol&#8217;n away from you,</line>
<line>It would be much vexation to your age.</line>
<line>Thus, for my duty&#8217;s sake, I rather chose</line>
<line>To cross my friend in his intended drift,</line>
<line>Than, by concealing it, heap on your head</line>
<line>A pack of sorrows which would press you down,</line>
<line>Being unprevented, to your timeless grave.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
<line>Proteus, I thank thee for thine honest care,</line>
<line>Which to requite, command me while I live.</line>
<line>This love of theirs myself have often seen,</line>
<line>Haply when they have judg&#8217;d me fast asleep,</line>
<line>And oftentimes have purpos&#8217;d to forbid</line>
<line>Sir Valentine her company and my court;</line>
<line>But fearing lest my jealous aim might err,</line>
<line>And so, unworthily, disgrace the man</line>
<line>(A rashness that I ever yet have shunn&#8217;d),</line>
<line>I gave him gentle looks, thereby to find</line>
<line>That which thyself hast now disclos&#8217;d to me.</line>
<line>And that thou mayst perceive my fear of this,</line>
<line>Knowing that tender youth is soon suggested,</line>
<line>I nightly lodge her in an upper tow&#8217;r,</line>
<line>The key whereof myself have ever kept;</line>
<line>And thence she cannot be convey&#8217;d away.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRO.</speaker>
<line>Know, noble lord, they have devis&#8217;d a mean</line>
<line>How he her chamber-window will ascend,</line>
<line>And with a corded ladder fetch her down;</line>
<line>For which the youthful lover now is gone,</line>
<line>And this way comes he with it presently,</line>
<line>Where (if it please you) you may intercept him.</line>
<line>But, good my lord, do it so cunningly</line>
<line>That my discovery be not aimed at:</line>
<line>For love of you, not hate unto my friend,</line>
<line>Hath made me publisher of this pretense.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
<line>Upon mine honor, he shall never know</line>
<line>That I had any light from thee of this.</line>

<stagedir>Enter Valentine.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
<line>Sir Valentine, whither away so fast?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>Please it your Grace, there is a messenger</line>
<line>That stays to bear my letters to my friends,</line>
<line>And I am going to deliver them.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
<line>Be they of much import?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>The tenure of them doth but signify</line>
<line>My health and happy being at your court.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
<line>Nay then no matter; stay with me a while;</line>
<line>I am to break with thee of some affairs</line>
<line>That touch me near, wherein thou must be secret.</line>
<line>&#8217;Tis not unknown to thee that I have sought</line>
<line>To match my friend Sir Thurio to my daughter.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>I know it well, my lord, and sure the match</line>
<line>Were rich and honorable; besides, the gentleman</line>
<line>Is full of virtue, bounty, worth, and qualities</line>
<line>Beseeming such a wife as your fair daughter.</line>
<line>Cannot your Grace win her to fancy him?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
<line>No, trust me, she is peevish, sullen, froward,</line>
<line>Proud, disobedient, stubborn, lacking duty,</line>
<line>Neither regarding that she is my child,</line>
<line>Nor fearing me as if I were her father;</line>
<line>And may I say to thee, this pride of hers</line>
<line>(Upon advice) hath drawn my love from her,</line>
<line>And where I thought the remnant of mine age</line>
<line>Should have been cherish&#8217;d by her child-like duty,</line>
<line>I now am full resolv&#8217;d to take a wife,</line>
<line>And turn her out to who will take her in:</line>
<line>Then let her beauty be her wedding-dow&#8217;r,</line>
<line>For me and my possessions she esteems not.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>What would your Grace have me to do in this?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
<line>There is a lady in Milano here</line>
<line>Whom I affect; but she is nice and coy,</line>
<line>And nought esteems my aged eloquence.</line>
<line>Now therefore would I have thee to my tutor</line>
<line>(For long agone I have forgot to court;</line>
<line>Besides, the fashion of the time is chang&#8217;d)</line>
<line>How and which way I may bestow myself</line>
<line>To be regarded in her sun-bright eye.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>Win her with gifts, if she respect not words:</line>
<line>Dumb jewels often in their silent kind</line>
<line>More than quick words do move a woman&#8217;s mind.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
<line>But she did scorn a present that I sent her.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>A woman sometime scorns what best contents her.</line>
<line>Send her another; never give her o&#8217;er,</line>
<line>For scorn at first makes after-love the more.</line>
<line>If she do frown, &#8217;tis not in hate of you,</line>
<line>But rather to beget more love in you.</line>
<line>If she do chide, &#8217;tis not to have you gone,</line>
<line>For why, the fools are mad, if left alone.</line>
<line>Take no repulse, what ever she doth say;</line>
<line>For &#8220;get you gone,&#8221; she doth not mean &#8220;away!&#8221;</line>
<line>Flatter and praise, commend, extol their graces;</line>
<line>Though ne&#8217;er so black, say they have angels&#8217; faces.</line>
<line>That man that hath a tongue, I say is no man,</line>
<line>If with his tongue he cannot win a woman.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
<line>But she I mean is promis&#8217;d by her friends</line>
<line>Unto a youthful gentleman of worth,</line>
<line>And kept severely from resort of men,</line>
<line>That no man hath access by day to her.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>Why then I would resort to her by night.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
<line>Ay, but the doors be lock&#8217;d, and keys kept safe,</line>
<line>That no man hath recourse to her by night.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>What lets but one may enter at her window?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
<line>Her chamber is aloft, far from the ground,</line>
<line>And built so shelving that one cannot climb it</line>
<line>Without apparent hazard of his life.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>Why then a ladder, quaintly made of cords,</line>
<line>To cast up, with a pair of anchoring hooks,</line>
<line>Would serve to scale another Hero&#8217;s tow&#8217;r,</line>
<line>So bold Leander would adventure it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
<line>Now as thou art a gentleman of blood,</line>
<line>Advise me where I may have such a ladder.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>When would you use it? Pray, sir, tell me that.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
<line>This very night; for Love is like a child,</line>
<line>That longs for every thing that he can come by.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>By seven a&#8217; clock I&#8217;ll get you such a ladder.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
<line>But hark thee: I will go to her alone.</line>
<line>How shall I best convey the ladder thither?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>It will be light, my lord, that you may bear it</line>
<line>Under a cloak that is of any length.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
<line>A cloak as long as thine will serve the turn?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>Ay, my good lord.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Then let me see thy cloak&#8212;</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll get me one of such another length.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>Why, any cloak will serve the turn, my lord.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
<line>How shall I fashion me to wear a cloak?</line>
<line>I pray thee let me feel thy cloak upon me.</line>
<line>What letter is this same? What&#8217;s here? &#8220;To Silvia&#8221;?</line>
<line>And here an engine fit for my proceeding!</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll be so bold to break the seal for once.</line>

<stagedir>Reads.</stagedir>
<line><recite>&#8220;My thoughts do harbor with my Silvia nightly,</recite></line>
<line><recite>And slaves they are to me that send them flying:</recite></line>
<line><recite>O, could their master come and go as lightly,</recite></line>
<line><recite>Himself would lodge where, senseless, they are lying!</recite></line>
<line><recite>My herald thoughts in thy pure bosom rest them,</recite></line>
<line><recite>While I, their king, that thither them importune,</recite></line>
<line><recite>Do curse the grace that with such grace hath blest them,</recite></line>
<line><recite>Because myself do want my servants&#8217; fortune.</recite></line>
<line><recite>I curse myself, for they are sent by me,</recite></line>
<line><recite>That they should harbor where their lord should be.&#8221;</recite></line>
<line>What&#8217;s here?</line>
<line><recite>&#8220;Silvia, this night I will enfranchise thee.&#8221;</recite></line>
<line>&#8217;Tis so; and here&#8217;s the ladder for the purpose.</line>
<line>Why, Pha&#235;ton (for thou art Merops&#8217; son),</line>
<line>Wilt thou aspire to guide the heavenly car,</line>
<line>And with thy daring folly burn the world?</line>
<line>Wilt thou reach stars, because they shine on thee?</line>
<line>Go, base intruder, overweening slave,</line>
<line>Bestow thy fawning smiles on equal mates,</line>
<line>And think my patience (more than thy desert)</line>
<line>Is privilege for thy departure hence.</line>
<line>Thank me for this more than for all the favors</line>
<line>Which (all too much) I have bestowed on thee.</line>
<line>But if thou linger in my territories</line>
<line>Longer than swiftest expedition</line>
<line>Will give thee time to leave our royal court,</line>
<line>By heaven, my wrath shall far exceed the love</line>
<line>I ever bore my daughter, or thyself.</line>
<line>Be gone, I will not hear thy vain excuse,</line>
<line>But as thou lov&#8217;st thy life, make speed from hence.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>And why not death, rather than living torment?</line>
<line>To die is to be banish&#8217;d from myself,</line>
<line>And Silvia is myself: banish&#8217;d from her</line>
<line>Is self from self, a deadly banishment.</line>
<line>What light is light, if Silvia be not seen?</line>
<line>What joy is joy, if Silvia be not by?</line>
<line>Unless it be to think that she is by,</line>
<line>And feed upon the shadow of perfection.</line>
<line>Except I be by Silvia in the night,</line>
<line>There is no music in the nightingale;</line>
<line>Unless I look on Silvia in the day,</line>
<line>There is no day for me to look upon.</line>
<line>She is my essence, and I leave to be,</line>
<line>If I be not by her fair influence</line>
<line>Foster&#8217;d, illumin&#8217;d, cherish&#8217;d, kept alive.</line>
<line>I fly not death, to fly his deadly doom:</line>
<line>Tarry I here, I but attend on death,</line>
<line>But fly I hence, I fly away from life.</line>

<line>Why, sir, I&#8217;ll strike nothing. I pray you&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRO.</speaker>
<line>Sirrah, I say forbear. Friend Valentine, a word.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>My ears are stopp&#8217;d and cannot hear good news,</line>
<line>So much of bad already hath possess&#8217;d them.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRO.</speaker>
<line>Then in dumb silence will I bury mine,</line>
<line>For they are harsh, untuneable, and bad.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>Is Silvia dead?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRO.</speaker>
<line>No, Valentine.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>No Valentine indeed, for sacred Silvia.</line>
<line>Hath she forsworn me?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRO.</speaker>
<line>No, Valentine.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>No Valentine, if Silvia have forsworn me. What is your news?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LAUNCE.</speaker>
<line>Sir, there is a proclamation that you are vanish&#8217;d.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRO.</speaker>
<line>That thou art banish&#8217;d&#8212;O, that&#8217;s the news!&#8212;</line>
<line>From hence, from Silvia, and from me thy friend.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>O, I have fed upon this woe already,</line>
<line>And now excess of it will make me surfeit.</line>
<line>Doth Silvia know that I am banished?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRO.</speaker>
<line>Ay, ay; and she hath offered to the doom</line>
<line>(Which unrevers&#8217;d stands in effectual force)</line>
<line>A sea of melting pearl, which some call tears;</line>
<line>Those at her father&#8217;s churlish feet she tender&#8217;d,</line>
<line>With them, upon her knees, her humble self,</line>
<line>Wringing her hands, whose whiteness so became them</line>
<line>As if but now they waxed pale for woe:</line>
<line>But neither bended knees, pure hands held up,</line>
<line>Sad sighs, deep groans, nor silver-shedding tears</line>
<line>Could penetrate her uncompassionate sire;</line>
<line>But Valentine, if he be ta&#8217;en, must die.</line>
<line>Besides, her intercession chaf&#8217;d him so,</line>
<line>When she for thy repeal was suppliant,</line>
<line>That to close prison he commanded her,</line>
<line>With many bitter threats of biding there.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>No more; unless the next word that thou speak&#8217;st</line>
<line>Have some malignant power upon my life;</line>
<line>If so&#8212;I pray thee breathe it in mine ear,</line>
<line>As ending anthem of my endless dolor.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRO.</speaker>
<line>Cease to lament for that thou canst not help,</line>
<line>And study help for that which thou lament&#8217;st.</line>
<line>Time is the nurse and breeder of all good.</line>
<line>Here if thou stay, thou canst not see thy love;</line>
<line>Besides, thy staying will abridge thy life.</line>
<line>Hope is a lover&#8217;s staff; walk hence with that</line>
<line>And manage it against despairing thoughts.</line>
<line>Thy letters may be here, though thou art hence,</line>
<line>Which, being writ to me, shall be deliver&#8217;d</line>
<line>Even in the milk-white bosom of thy love.</line>
<line>The time now serves not to expostulate:</line>
<line>Come, I&#8217;ll convey thee through the city-gate;</line>
<line>And ere I part with thee, confer at large</line>
<line>Of all that may concern thy love-affairs.</line>
<line>As thou lov&#8217;st Silvia (though not for thyself)</line>
<line>Regard thy danger, and along with me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>I pray thee, Launce, and if thou seest my boy,</line>
<line>Bid him make haste and meet me at the North-gate.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRO.</speaker>
<line>Go, sirrah, find him out. Come, Valentine.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>O my dear Silvia! Hapless Valentine!</line>

<stagedir>Exeunt Valentine and Proteus.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>LAUNCE.</speaker>
<line>I am but a fool, look you, and yet I have the wit to think my master is a kind of a knave; but that&#8217;s all one, if he be but one knave. He lives not now that knows me to be in love, yet I am in love, but a team of horse shall not pluck that from me; nor who &#8217;tis I love; and yet &#8217;tis a woman; but what woman, I will not tell myself; and yet &#8217;tis a milkmaid; yet &#8217;tis not a maid, for she hath had gossips; yet &#8217;tis a maid, for she is her master&#8217;s maid, and serves for wages. She hath more qualities than a water-spaniel, which is much in a bare Christian.</line>
<stagedir>Pulling out a paper.</stagedir>
<line>Here is the cate-log of her condition. &#8220;Inprimis, She can fetch and carry.&#8221; Why, a horse can do no more; nay, a horse cannot fetch, but only carry, therefore is she better than a jade. &#8220;Item, She can milk.&#8221; Look you, a sweet virtue in a maid with clean hands.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Speed.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line>How now, Signior Launce? What news with your mastership?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LAUNCE.</speaker>
<line>With my master&#8217;s ship? Why, it is at sea.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line>Well, your old vice still: mistake the word. What news then in your paper?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LAUNCE.</speaker>
<line>The blackest news that ever thou heardst.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line>Why, man? How black?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LAUNCE.</speaker>
<line>Why, as black as ink.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line>Let me read them.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>LAUNCE.</speaker>
<line>Fie on thee, jolthead, thou canst not read.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line>Thou liest; I can.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LAUNCE.</speaker>
<line>I will try thee. Tell me this: who begot thee?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line>Marry, the son of my grandfather.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LAUNCE.</speaker>
<line>O illiterate loiterer! It was the son of thy grandmother. This proves that thou canst not read.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line>Come, fool, come; try me in thy paper.</line>
</speech>

<speech>

<line>Ay, that she can.</line>

<line><recite>&#8220;Item, She brews good ale.&#8221;</recite></line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line><recite>&#8220;Item, She can sew.&#8221;</recite></line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LAUNCE.</speaker>
<line>That&#8217;s as much as to say, &#8220;Can she so?&#8221;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line><recite>&#8220;Item, She can knit.&#8221;</recite></line>

<speech>

<line>What need a man care for a stock with a wench, when she can knit him a stock?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line><recite>&#8220;Item, She can wash and scour.&#8221;</recite></line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LAUNCE.</speaker>
<line>A special virtue; for then she need not be wash&#8217;d and scour&#8217;d.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line><recite>&#8220;Item, She can spin.&#8221;</recite></line>

<line>Then may I set the world on wheels, when she can spin for her living.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line><recite>&#8220;Item, She hath many nameless virtues.&#8221;</recite></line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LAUNCE.</speaker>
<line>That&#8217;s as much as to say &#8220;bastard virtues,&#8221; that indeed know not their fathers, and therefore have no names.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line>Here follow her vices.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LAUNCE.</speaker>
<line>Close at the heels of her virtues.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line><recite>&#8220;Item, She is not to be kiss&#8217;d fasting, in respect of her breath.&#8221;</recite></line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LAUNCE.</speaker>
<line>Well, that fault may be mended with a breakfast. Read on.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line><recite>&#8220;Item, She hath a sweet mouth.&#8221;</recite></line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LAUNCE.</speaker>
<line>That makes amends for her sour breath.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line><recite>&#8220;Item, She doth talk in her sleep.&#8221;</recite></line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LAUNCE.</speaker>
<line>It&#8217;s no matter for that, so she sleep not in her talk.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line><recite>&#8220;Item, She is slow in words.&#8221;</recite></line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LAUNCE.</speaker>
<line>O villain, that set this down among her vices! To be slow in words is a woman&#8217;s only virtue. I pray thee out with&#8217;t, and place it for her chief virtue.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line><recite>&#8220;Item, She is proud.&#8221;</recite></line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LAUNCE.</speaker>
<line>Out with that too; it was Eve&#8217;s legacy, and cannot be ta&#8217;en from her.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line><recite>&#8220;Item, She hath no teeth.&#8221;</recite></line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LAUNCE.</speaker>
<line>I care not for that neither, because I love crusts.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line><recite>&#8220;Item, She is curst.&#8221;</recite></line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LAUNCE.</speaker>
<line>Well, the best is, she hath no teeth to bite.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line><recite>&#8220;Item, She will often praise her liquor.&#8221;</recite></line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LAUNCE.</speaker>
<line>If her liquor be good, she shall; if she will not, I will; for good things should be prais&#8217;d.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line><recite>&#8220;Item, She is too liberal.&#8221;</recite></line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LAUNCE.</speaker>
<line>Of her tongue she cannot, for that&#8217;s writ down she is slow of; of her purse she shall not, for that I&#8217;ll keep shut. Now, of another thing she may, and that cannot I help. Well, proceed.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line><recite>&#8220;Item, She hath more hair than wit, and more faults than hairs, and more wealth than faults.&#8221;</recite></line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LAUNCE.</speaker>
<line>Stop there; I&#8217;ll have her. She was mine and not mine twice or thrice in that last article. Rehearse that once more.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line><recite>&#8220;Item, She hath more hair than wit&#8221;&#8212;</recite></line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LAUNCE.</speaker>
<line>More hair than wit? It may be; I&#8217;ll prove it: the cover of the salt hides the salt, and therefore it is more than the salt; the hair that covers the wit is more than the wit, for the greater hides the less. What&#8217;s next?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line><recite>&#8220;And more faults than hairs&#8221;&#8212;</recite></line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LAUNCE.</speaker>
<line>That&#8217;s monstrous. O that that were out!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line><recite>&#8220;And more wealth than faults.&#8221;</recite></line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LAUNCE.</speaker>
<line>Why, that word makes the faults gracious. Well, I&#8217;ll have her; and if it be a match, as nothing is impossible&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line>What then?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LAUNCE.</speaker>
<line>Why, then will I tell thee&#8212;that thy master stays for thee at the North-gate.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line>For me?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LAUNCE.</speaker>
<line>For thee? Ay, who art thou? He hath stay&#8217;d for a better man than thee.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line>And must I go to him?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LAUNCE.</speaker>
<line>Thou must run to him, for thou hast stay&#8217;d so long that going will scarce serve the turn.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SPEED.</speaker>
<line>Why didst not tell me sooner? Pox of your love-letters!</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>LAUNCE.</speaker>
<line>Now will he be swing&#8217;d for reading my letter&#8212;an unmannerly slave, that will thrust himself into secrets. I&#8217;ll after, to rejoice in the boy&#8217;s correction.</line>

<stagedir>Enter Duke, Thurio.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
<line>Sir Thurio, fear not but that she will love you</line>
<line>Now Valentine is banish&#8217;d from her sight.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>THU.</speaker>
<line>Since his exile she hath despis&#8217;d me most,</line>
<line>Forsworn my company, and rail&#8217;d at me,</line>
<line>That I am desperate of obtaining her.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
<line>This weak impress of love is as a figure</line>
<line>Trenched in ice, which with an hour&#8217;s heat</line>
<line>Dissolves to water, and doth lose his form.</line>
<line>A little time will melt her frozen thoughts,</line>
<line>And worthless Valentine shall be forgot.</line>

<stagedir>Enter Proteus.</stagedir>
<line>How now, Sir Proteus? Is your countryman,</line>
<line>According to our proclamation, gone?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRO.</speaker>
<line>Gone, my good lord.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
<line>My daughter takes his going grievously.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRO.</speaker>
<line>A little time, my lord, will kill that grief.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
<line>So I believe; but Thurio thinks not so.</line>
<line>Proteus, the good conceit I hold of thee</line>
<line>(For thou hast shown some sign of good desert)</line>
<line>Makes me the better to confer with thee.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRO.</speaker>
<line>Longer than I prove loyal to your Grace</line>
<line>Let me not live to look upon your Grace.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
<line>Thou know&#8217;st how willingly I would effect</line>
<line>The match between Sir Thurio and my daughter?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRO.</speaker>
<line>I do, my lord.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
<line>And also, I think, thou art not ignorant</line>
<line>How she opposes her against my will?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRO.</speaker>
<line>She did, my lord, when Valentine was here.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
<line>Ay, and perversely she persevers so.</line>
<line>What might we do to make the girl forget</line>
<line>The love of Valentine, and love Sir Thurio?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRO.</speaker>
<line>The best way is to slander Valentine</line>
<line>With falsehood, cowardice, and poor descent,</line>
<line>Three things that women highly hold in hate.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
<line>Ay, but she&#8217;ll think that it is spoke in hate.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRO.</speaker>
<line>Ay, if his enemy deliver it;</line>
<line>Therefore it must with circumstance be spoken</line>
<line>By one whom she esteemeth as his friend.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
<line>Then you must undertake to slander him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRO.</speaker>
<line>And that, my lord, I shall be loath to do:</line>
<line>&#8217;Tis an ill office for a gentleman,</line>
<line>Especially against his very friend.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
<line>Where your good word cannot advantage him,</line>
<line>Your slander never can endamage him;</line>
<line>Therefore the office is indifferent,</line>
<line>Being entreated to it by your friend.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRO.</speaker>
<line>You have prevail&#8217;d, my lord; if I can do it</line>
<line>By aught that I can speak in his dispraise,</line>
<line>She shall not long continue love to him.</line>
<line>But say this weed her love from Valentine,</line>
<line>It follows not that she will love Sir Thurio.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>THU.</speaker>
<line>Therefore, as you unwind her love from him,</line>
<line>Lest it should ravel and be good to none,</line>
<line>You must provide to bottom it on me;</line>
<line>Which must be done by praising me as much</line>
<line>As you in worth dispraise Sir Valentine.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
<line>And, Proteus, we dare trust you in this kind,</line>
<line>Because we know (on Valentine&#8217;s report)</line>
<line>You are already Love&#8217;s firm votary,</line>
<line>And cannot soon revolt and change your mind.</line>
<line>Upon this warrant shall you have access</line>
<line>Where you with Silvia may confer at large&#8212;</line>
<line>For she is lumpish, heavy, melancholy,</line>
<line>And (for your friend&#8217;s sake) will be glad of you&#8212;</line>
<line>Where you may temper her by your persuasion</line>
<line>To hate young Valentine and love my friend.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRO.</speaker>
<line>As much as I can do, I will effect.</line>
<line>But you, Sir Thurio, are not sharp enough;</line>
<line>You must lay lime to tangle her desires</line>
<line>By wailful sonnets, whose composed rhymes</line>
<line>Should be full-fraught with serviceable vows.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
<line>Ay, much is the force of heaven-bred poesy.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRO.</speaker>
<line>Say that upon the altar of her beauty</line>
<line>You sacrifice your tears, your sighs, your heart;</line>
<line>Write till your ink be dry, and with your tears</line>
<line>Moist it again, and frame some feeling line</line>
<line>That may discover such integrity:</line>
<line>For Orpheus&#8217; lute was strung with poets&#8217; sinews,</line>
<line>Whose golden touch could soften steel and stones,</line>
<line>Make tigers tame, and huge leviathans</line>
<line>Forsake unsounded deeps to dance on sands.</line>
<line>After your dire-lamenting elegies,</line>
<line>Visit by night your lady&#8217;s chamber-window</line>
<line>With some sweet consort; to their instruments</line>
<line>Tune a deploring dump&#8212;the night&#8217;s dead silence</line>
<line>Will well become such sweet-complaining grievance.</line>
<line>This, or else nothing, will inherit her.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
<line>This discipline shows thou hast been in love.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>THU.</speaker>
<line>And thy advice this night I&#8217;ll put in practice:</line>
<line>Therefore, sweet Proteus, my direction-giver,</line>
<line>Let us into the city presently</line>
<line>To sort some gentlemen well skill&#8217;d in music.</line>
<line>I have a sonnet that will serve the turn</line>
<line>To give the onset to thy good advice.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUKE.</speaker>

<line>Ay, by my beard, will we, for he is a proper man.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>Then know that I have little wealth to lose.</line>
<line>A man I am cross&#8217;d with adversity;</line>
<line>My riches are these poor habiliments,</line>
<line>Of which if you should here disfurnish me,</line>
<line>You take the sum and substance that I have.</line>

<line>What, were you banish&#8217;d thence?</line>

<line>For what offense?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>For that which now torments me to rehearse:</line>
<line>I kill&#8217;d a man, whose death I much repent,</line>
<line>But yet I slew him manfully in fight,</line>
<line>Without false vantage, or base treachery.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. OUT.</speaker>
<line>Why, ne&#8217;er repent it, if it were done so.</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. OUT.</speaker>
<line>And I for such like petty crimes as these.</line>
<line>But to the purpose&#8212;for we cite our faults</line>
<line>That they may hold excus&#8217;d our lawless lives;</line>
<line>And partly, seeing you are beautified</line>
<line>With goodly shape, and by your own report</line>
<line>A linguist, and a man of such perfection</line>
<line>As we do in our quality much want&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. OUT.</speaker>
<line>Indeed because you are a banish&#8217;d man,</line>
<line>Therefore, above the rest, we parley to you:</line>

<stagedir>Enter Proteus.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>PRO.</speaker>
<line>Already have I been false to Valentine,</line>
<line>And now I must be as unjust to Thurio:</line>
<line>Under the color of commending him,</line>
<line>I have access my own love to prefer&#8212;</line>
<line>But Silvia is too fair, too true, too holy,</line>
<line>To be corrupted with my worthless gifts.</line>
<line>When I protest true loyalty to her,</line>
<line>She twits me with my falsehood to my friend;</line>
<line>When to her beauty I commend my vows,</line>
<line>She bids me think how I have been forsworn</line>
<line>In breaking faith with Julia whom I lov&#8217;d;</line>
<line>And notwithstanding all her sudden quips,</line>
<line>The least whereof would quell a lover&#8217;s hope,</line>
<line>Yet, spaniel-like, the more she spurns my love,</line>
<line>The more it grows, and fawneth on her still.</line>

<stagedir>Enter Thurio, Musicians.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>THU.</speaker>
<line>Ay, but I hope, sir, that you love not here.</line>

<line type="lyric">Is she kind as she is fair?</line>

<speaker>HOST.</speaker>
<line>You have a quick ear.</line>

<line>Sir Proteus, as I take it.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>SIL.</speaker>
<line>You have your wish: my will is even this,</line>
<line>That presently you hie you home to bed.</line>
<line>Thou subtile, perjur&#8217;d, false, disloyal man,</line>
<line>Think&#8217;st thou I am so shallow, so conceitless,</line>
<line>To be seduced by thy flattery,</line>
<line>That hast deceiv&#8217;d so many with thy vows?</line>
<line>Return, return, and make thy love amends.</line>
<line>For me (by this pale queen of night I swear),</line>
<line>I am so far from granting thy request,</line>

<line>And by and by intend to chide myself</line>
<line>Even for this time I spend in talking to thee.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRO.</speaker>
<line>I grant, sweet love, that I did love a lady;</line>

<line>The picture that is hanging in your chamber;</line>
<line>To that I&#8217;ll speak, to that I&#8217;ll sigh and weep;</line>
<line>For since the substance of your perfect self</line>
<line>Is else devoted, I am but a shadow;</line>
<line>And to your shadow will I make true love.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>JUL.</speaker>

<stagedir>Enter Launce with his dog.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>LAUNCE.</speaker>
<line>When a man&#8217;s servant shall play the cur with him, look you, it goes hard: one that I brought up of a puppy; one that I sav&#8217;d from drowning, when three or four of his blind brothers and sisters went to it. I have taught him, even as one would say precisely, &#8220;Thus I would teach a dog.&#8221; I was sent to deliver him as a present to Mistress Silvia from my master; and I came no sooner into the dining-chamber but he steps me to her trencher and steals her capon&#8217;s leg. O, &#8217;tis a foul thing when a cur cannot keep himself in all companies! I would have (as one should say) one that takes upon him to be a dog indeed, to be, as it were, a dog at all things. If I had not had more wit than he, to take a fault upon me that he did, I think verily he had been hang&#8217;d for&#8217;t; sure as I live he had suffer&#8217;d for&#8217;t. You shall judge: he thrusts me himself into the company of three or four gentleman-like dogs, under the Duke&#8217;s table. He had not been there (bless the mark!) a pissing-while, but all the chamber smelt him. &#8220;Out with the dog,&#8221; says one. &#8220;What cur is that?&#8221; says another. &#8220;Whip him out,&#8221; says the third. &#8220;Hang him up,&#8221; says the Duke. I, having been acquainted with the smell before, knew it was Crab, and goes me to the fellow that whips the dogs: &#8220;Friend,&#8221; quoth I, &#8220;you mean to whip the dog?&#8221; &#8220;Ay, marry, do I,&#8221; quoth he. &#8220;You do him the more wrong,&#8221; quoth I, &#8220;&#8217;twas I did the thing you wot of.&#8221; He makes me no more ado, but whips me out of the chamber. How many masters would do this for his servant? Nay, I&#8217;ll be sworn, I have sat in the stocks for puddings he hath stol&#8217;n, otherwise he had been executed; I have stood on the pillory for geese he hath kill&#8217;d, otherwise he had suffer&#8217;d for&#8217;t. Thou think&#8217;st not of this now. Nay, I remember the trick you serv&#8217;d me, when I took my leave of Madam Silvia. Did not I bid thee still mark me, and do as I do? When didst thou see me heave up my leg and make water against a gentlewoman&#8217;s farthingale? Didst thou ever see me do such a trick?</line>

<line>Because I love him, I must pity him.</line>
<line>This ring I gave him when he parted from me,</line>

<line>Madam, please you peruse this letter&#8212;</line>
<line>Pardon me, madam, I have unadvis&#8217;d</line>

<line>This is the letter to your ladyship.</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIL.</speaker>
<line>There, hold!</line>
<line>I will not look upon your master&#8217;s lines;</line>
<line>I know they are stuff&#8217;d with protestations,</line>
<line>And full of new-found oaths, which he will break</line>
<line>As easily as I do tear his paper.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JUL.</speaker>
<line>Madam, he sends your ladyship this ring.</line>
</speech>

<speech>

<line>The more shame for him that he sends it me;</line>

<line>Mine shall not do his Julia so much wrong.</line>

<line>Dost thou know her?</line>

<speech>
<speaker>SIL.</speaker>
<line>Belike she thinks that Proteus hath forsook her?</line>
</speech>

<speech>

<line>I think she doth; and that&#8217;s her cause of sorrow.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIL.</speaker>
<line>Is she not passing fair?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JUL.</speaker>
<line>She hath been fairer, madam, than she is:</line>
<line>When she did think my master lov&#8217;d her well,</line>
<line>She, in my judgment, was as fair as you;</line>
<line>But since she did neglect her looking-glass,</line>
<line>And threw her sun-expelling mask away,</line>
<line>The air hath starv&#8217;d the roses in her cheeks,</line>
<line>And pinch&#8217;d the lily-tincture of her face,</line>
<line>That now she is become as black as I.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIL.</speaker>
<line>How tall was she?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JUL.</speaker>
<line>About my stature; for at Pentecost,</line>
<line>When all our pageants of delight were play&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Our youth got me to play the woman&#8217;s part,</line>
<line>And I was trimm&#8217;d in Madam Julia&#8217;s gown,</line>
<line>Which served me as fit, by all men&#8217;s judgments,</line>
<line>As if the garment had been made for me;</line>
<line>Therefore I know she is about my height.</line>
<line>And at that time I made her weep agood,</line>
<line>For I did play a lamentable part.</line>
<line>Madam, &#8217;twas Ariadne passioning</line>
<line>For Theseus&#8217; perjury and unjust flight;</line>
<line>Which I so lively acted with my tears</line>
<line>That my poor mistress, moved therewithal,</line>
<line>Wept bitterly; and would I might be dead</line>
<line>If I in thought felt not her very sorrow.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIL.</speaker>
<line>She is beholding to thee, gentle youth.</line>
<line>Alas, poor lady, desolate and left!</line>
<line>I weep myself to think upon thy words.</line>
<line>Here, youth, there is my purse; I give thee this</line>
<line>For thy sweet mistress&#8217; sake, because thou lov&#8217;st her.</line>
<line>Farewell.</line>

<stagedir>Exit Silvia with Attendants.</stagedir>
<line>A virtuous gentlewoman, mild and beautiful!</line>
<line>I hope my master&#8217;s suit will be but cold,</line>
<line>Since she respects my mistress&#8217; love so much.</line>
<line>Alas, how love can trifle with itself!</line>
<line>Here is her picture: let me see; I think</line>
<line>If I had such a tire, this face of mine</line>
<line>Were full as lovely as is this of hers;</line>
<line>And yet the painter flatter&#8217;d her a little,</line>
<line>Unless I flatter with myself too much.</line>
<line>Her hair is auburn, mine is perfect yellow:</line>
<line>If that be all the difference in his love,</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll get me such a color&#8217;d periwig.</line>
<line>Her eyes are grey as glass, and so are mine;</line>
<line>Ay, but her forehead&#8217;s low, and mine&#8217;s as high.</line>
<line>What should it be that he respects in her,</line>
<line>But I can make respective in myself,</line>
<line>If this fond Love were not a blinded god?</line>
<line>Come, shadow, come, and take this shadow up,</line>
<line>For &#8217;tis thy rival. O thou senseless form,</line>
<line>Thou shalt be worshipp&#8217;d, kiss&#8217;d, lov&#8217;d, and ador&#8217;d;</line>
<line>And were there sense in his idolatry,</line>
<line>My substance should be statue in thy stead.</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll use thee kindly for thy mistress&#8217; sake</line>
<line>That us&#8217;d me so; or else, by Jove I vow,</line>
<line>I should have scratch&#8217;d out your unseeing eyes,</line>

<line>Besides, she did intend confession</line>
<line>At Patrick&#8217;s cell this even, and there she was not.</line>

<line>Love, lend me patience to forbear a while.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIL.</speaker>
<line>O miserable, unhappy that I am!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRO.</speaker>
<line>Unhappy were you, madam, ere I came;</line>
<line>But by my coming I have made you happy.</line>

<line>By thy approach thou mak&#8217;st me most unhappy.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>JUL.</speaker>
<stagedir>Aside.</stagedir>
<line>And me, when he approacheth to your presence.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIL.</speaker>
<line>Had I been seized by a hungry lion,</line>
<line>I would have been a breakfast to the beast</line>
<line>Rather than have false Proteus rescue me.</line>
<line>O heaven be judge how I love Valentine,</line>
<line>Whose life&#8217;s as tender to me as my soul!</line>
<line>And full as much (for more there cannot be)</line>
<line>I do detest false perjur&#8217;d Proteus.</line>
<line>Therefore be gone, solicit me no more.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRO.</speaker>
<line>What dangerous action, stood it next to death,</line>
<line>Would I not undergo for one calm look?</line>
<line>O, &#8217;tis the curse in love, and still approv&#8217;d,</line>
<line>When women cannot love where they&#8217;re belov&#8217;d!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIL.</speaker>
<line>When Proteus cannot love where he&#8217;s belov&#8217;d!</line>
<line>Read over Julia&#8217;s heart (thy first best love),</line>
<line>For whose dear sake thou didst then rend thy faith</line>
<line>Into a thousand oaths; and all those oaths</line>
<line>Descended into perjury, to love me.</line>
<line>Thou hast no faith left now, unless thou&#8217;dst two,</line>
<line>And that&#8217;s far worse than none: better have none</line>
<line>Than plural faith, which is too much by one.</line>
<line>Thou counterfeit to thy true friend!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRO.</speaker>
<line offset="7">In love</line>
<line>Who respects friend?</line>

<line offset="4">All men but Proteus.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRO.</speaker>
<line>Nay, if the gentle spirit of moving words</line>
<line>Can no way change you to a milder form,</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll woo you like a soldier, at arm&#8217;s end,</line>
<line>And love you &#8217;gainst the nature of love&#8212;force ye.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<stagedir>Coming forward.</stagedir>
<line>Ruffian! Let go that rude uncivil touch,</line>
<line>Thou friend of an ill fashion!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRO.</speaker>
<line offset="6">Valentine!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>Thou common friend, that&#8217;s without faith or love,</line>
<line>For such is a friend now! Treacherous man,</line>
<line>Thou hast beguil&#8217;d my hopes! Nought but mine eye</line>
<line>Could have persuaded me; now I dare not say</line>
<line>I have one friend alive; thou wouldst disprove me.</line>
<line>Who should be trusted, when one&#8217;s right hand</line>
<line>Is perjured to the bosom? Proteus,</line>
<line>I am sorry I must never trust thee more,</line>
<line>But count the world a stranger for thy sake.</line>
<line>The private wound is deepest: O time most accurst!</line>
<line>&#8217;Mongst all foes that a friend should be the worst!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRO.</speaker>
<line>My shame and guilt confounds me.</line>
<line>Forgive me, Valentine; if hearty sorrow</line>
<line>Be a sufficient ransom for offense,</line>
<line>I tender&#8217;t here: I do as truly suffer</line>
<line>As e&#8217;er I did commit.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Then I am paid;</line>
<line>And once again I do receive thee honest.</line>
<line>Who by repentance is not satisfied</line>
<line>Is nor of heaven nor earth, for these are pleas&#8217;d;</line>
<line>By penitence th&#8217; Eternal&#8217;s wrath&#8217;s appeas&#8217;d:</line>
<line>And that my love may appear plain and free,</line>
<line>All that was mine in Silvia I give thee.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JUL.</speaker>
<line>O me unhappy!</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Swoons.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>PRO.</speaker>
<line>Look to the boy.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>Why, boy! Why, wag! How now? What&#8217;s the matter? Look up; speak.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JUL.</speaker>
<line>O good sir, my master charg&#8217;d me to deliver a ring to Madam Silvia, which (out of my neglect) was never done.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRO.</speaker>
<line>Where is that ring, boy?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JUL.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Here &#8217;tis; this is it.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Shows a ring.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>PRO.</speaker>
<line>How? Let me see.</line>
<line>Why, this is the ring I gave to Julia.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JUL.</speaker>
<line>O, cry you mercy, sir, I have mistook;</line>
<line>This is the ring you sent to Silvia.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Shows another ring.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>PRO.</speaker>
<line>But how cam&#8217;st thou by this ring? At my depart</line>
<line>I gave this unto Julia.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JUL.</speaker>
<line>And Julia herself did give it me,</line>
<line>And Julia herself hath brought it hither.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRO.</speaker>
<line>How? Julia?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JUL.</speaker>
<line>Behold her that gave aim to all thy oaths,</line>
<line>And entertain&#8217;d &#8217;em deeply in her heart.</line>
<line>How oft hast thou with perjury cleft the root?</line>
<line>O Proteus, let this habit make thee blush!</line>
<line>Be thou asham&#8217;d that I have took upon me</line>
<line>Such an immodest raiment&#8212;if shame live</line>
<line>In a disguise of love!</line>
<line>It is the lesser blot, modesty finds,</line>
<line>Women to change their shapes than men their minds.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRO.</speaker>
<line>Than men their minds? &#8217;Tis true. O heaven, were man</line>
<line>But constant, he were perfect; that one error</line>
<line>Fills him with faults; makes him run through all th&#8217; sins:</line>
<line>Inconstancy falls off ere it begins.</line>
<line>What is in Silvia&#8217;s face, but I may spy</line>
<line>More fresh in Julia&#8217;s with a constant eye?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>Come, come, a hand from either.</line>
<line>Let me be blest to make this happy close;</line>
<line>&#8217;Twere pity two such friends should be long foes.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRO.</speaker>
<line>Bear witness, heaven, I have my wish forever.</line>

<speaker>ALL OUTLAWS</speaker>
<line>A prize, a prize, a prize!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>Forbear, forbear, I say; it is my lord the Duke.</line>
<line>Your Grace is welcome to a man disgrac&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Banished Valentine.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Sir Valentine!</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>Thurio, give back, or else embrace thy death;</line>
<line>Come not within the measure of my wrath.</line>
<line>Do not name Silvia thine; if once again,</line>
<line>Milan shall not hold thee. Here she stands,</line>
<line>Take but possession of her with a touch:</line>
<line>I dare thee but to breathe upon my love.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>THU.</speaker>
<line>Sir Valentine, I care not for her, I;</line>
<line>I hold him but a fool that will endanger</line>
<line>His body for a girl that loves him not.</line>
<line>I claim her not, and therefore she is thine.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
<line>The more degenerate and base art thou</line>
<line>To make such means for her as thou hast done,</line>
<line>And leave her on such slight conditions.</line>
<line>Now, by the honor of my ancestry,</line>
<line>I do applaud thy spirit, Valentine,</line>
<line>And think thee worthy of an empress&#8217; love.</line>
<line>Know then, I here forget all former griefs,</line>
<line>Cancel all grudge, repeal thee home again,</line>
<line>Plead a new state in thy unrivall&#8217;d merit,</line>
<line>To which I thus subscribe: Sir Valentine,</line>
<line>Thou art a gentleman and well deriv&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Take thou thy Silvia, for thou hast deserv&#8217;d her.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>I thank your Grace; the gift hath made me happy.</line>
<line>I now beseech you (for your daughter&#8217;s sake)</line>
<line>To grant one boon that I shall ask of you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
<line>I grant it (for thine own) what e&#8217;er it be.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>These banish&#8217;d men, that I have kept withal,</line>
<line>Are men endu&#8217;d with worthy qualities.</line>
<line>Forgive them what they have committed here,</line>
<line>And let them be recall&#8217;d from their exile;</line>
<line>They are reformed, civil, full of good,</line>
<line>And fit for great employment, worthy lord.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
<line>Thou hast prevail&#8217;d, I pardon them and thee;</line>
<line>Dispose of them as thou know&#8217;st their deserts.</line>
<line>Come, let us go, we will include all jars</line>
<line>With triumphs, mirth, and rare solemnity.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>And as we walk along, I dare be bold</line>
<line>With our discourse to make your Grace to smile.</line>
<line>What think you of this page, my lord?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
<line>I think the boy hath grace in him; he blushes.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>I warrant you, my lord&#8212;more grace than boy.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
<line>What mean you by that saying?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>Please you, I&#8217;ll tell you as we pass along,</line>
<line>That you will wonder what hath fortuned.</line>
<line>Come, Proteus, &#8217;tis your penance but to hear</line>
<line>The story of your loves discovered;</line>
<line>That done, our day of marriage shall be yours,</line>
<line>One feast, one house, one mutual happiness.</line>
