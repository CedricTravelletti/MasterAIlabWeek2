<STAGEDIR>Enter Valentine, Proteus.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Cease to persuade, my loving Proteus:</LINE>
<LINE>Home-keeping youth have ever homely wits.</LINE>
<LINE>Were&#8217;t not affection chains thy tender days</LINE>
<LINE>To the sweet glances of thy honor&#8217;d love,</LINE>
<LINE>I rather would entreat thy company,</LINE>
<LINE>To see the wonders of the world abroad,</LINE>
<LINE>Than (living dully sluggardiz&#8217;d at home)</LINE>
<LINE>Wear out thy youth with shapeless idleness.</LINE>
<LINE>But since thou lov&#8217;st, love still, and thrive therein,</LINE>
<LINE>Even as I would, when I to love begin.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Wilt thou be gone? Sweet Valentine, <FRENCH lang="fr">adieu</FRENCH>,</LINE>
<LINE>Think on thy Proteus, when thou, happ&#8217;ly, seest</LINE>
<LINE>Some rare noteworthy object in thy travel.</LINE>
<LINE>Wish me partaker in thy happiness</LINE>
<LINE>When thou dost meet good hap; and in thy danger</LINE>
<LINE>(If ever danger do environ thee)</LINE>
<LINE>Commend thy grievance to my holy prayers,</LINE>
<LINE>For I will be thy beadsman, Valentine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And on a love-book pray for my success?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Upon some book I love I&#8217;ll pray for thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That&#8217;s on some shallow story of deep love,</LINE>
<LINE>How young Leander cross&#8217;d the Hellespont.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That&#8217;s a deep story of a deeper love,</LINE>
<LINE>For he was more than over shoes in love.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis true; for you are over boots in love,</LINE>
<LINE>And yet you never swom the Hellespont.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Over the boots? Nay, give me not the boots.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, I will not; for it boots thee not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">What?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To be in love&#8212;where scorn is bought with groans;</LINE>
<LINE>Coy looks with heart-sore sighs; one fading moment&#8217;s mirth</LINE>
<LINE>With twenty watchful, weary, tedious nights:</LINE>
<LINE>If happ&#8217;ly won, perhaps a hapless gain;</LINE>
<LINE>If lost, why then a grievous labor won;</LINE>
<LINE>However&#8212;but a folly bought with wit,</LINE>
<LINE>Or else a wit by folly vanquished.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So, by your circumstance, you call me fool.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So, by your circumstance, I fear You&#8217;ll prove.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis love you cavil at, I am not Love.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Love is your master, for he masters you;</LINE>
<LINE>And he that is so yoked by a fool,</LINE>
<LINE>Methinks should not be chronicled for wise.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yet writers say: as in the sweetest bud</LINE>
<LINE>The eating canker dwells, so eating love</LINE>
<LINE>Inhabits in the finest wits of all.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And writers say: as the most forward bud</LINE>
<LINE>Is eaten by the canker ere it blow,</LINE>
<LINE>Even so by love the young and tender wit</LINE>
<LINE>Is turn&#8217;d to folly, blasting in the bud,</LINE>
<LINE>Losing his verdure, even in the prime,</LINE>
<LINE>And all the fair effects of future hopes.</LINE>
<LINE>But wherefore waste I time to counsel thee</LINE>
<LINE>That art a votary to fond desire?</LINE>
<LINE>Once more <FRENCH lang="fr">adieu</FRENCH>. My father at the road</LINE>
<LINE>Expects my coming, there to see me shipp&#8217;d.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And thither will I bring thee, Valentine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sweet Proteus, no; now let us take our leave.</LINE>
<LINE>To Milan let me hear from thee by letters</LINE>
<LINE>Of thy success in love, and what news else</LINE>
<LINE>Betideth here in absence of thy friend;</LINE>
<LINE>And I likewise will visit thee with mine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>All happiness bechance to thee in Milan.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As much to you at home; and so farewell.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He after honor hunts, I after love:</LINE>
<LINE>He leaves his friends, to dignify them more;</LINE>
<LINE>I leave myself, my friends, and all, for love.</LINE>
<LINE>Thou, Julia, thou hast metamorphis&#8217;d me,</LINE>
<LINE>Made me neglect my studies, lose my time,</LINE>
<LINE>War with good counsel, set the world at nought;</LINE>
<LINE>Made wit with musing weak, heart sick with thought.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Speed.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SPEED.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir Proteus! &#8217;Save you! Saw you my master?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But now he parted hence to embark for Milan.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SPEED.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Twenty to one then he is shipp&#8217;d already,</LINE>
<LINE>And I have play&#8217;d the sheep in losing him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Indeed a sheep doth very often stray,</LINE>
<LINE>And if the shepherd be awhile away.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SPEED.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You conclude that my master is a shepherd then, and I a sheep?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SPEED.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why then my horns are his horns, whether I wake or sleep.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A silly answer, and fitting well a sheep.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SPEED.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This proves me still a sheep.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>True; and thy master a shepherd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SPEED.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, that I can deny by a circumstance.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It shall go hard but I&#8217;ll prove it by another.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SPEED.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The shepherd seeks the sheep, and not the sheep the shepherd; but I seek my master, and my master seeks not me: therefore I am no sheep.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The sheep for fodder follow the shepherd, the shepherd for food follows not the sheep; thou for wages followest thy master, thy master for wages follows not thee: therefore thou art a sheep.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SPEED.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Such another proof will make me cry &#8220;baa.&#8221;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But dost thou hear? Gav&#8217;st thou my letter to Julia?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SPEED.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, sir; I (a lost mutton) gave your letter to her (a lac&#8217;d mutton), and she (a lac&#8217;d mutton) gave me (a lost mutton) nothing for my labor.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here&#8217;s too small a pasture for such store of muttons.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SPEED.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If the ground be overcharg&#8217;d, you were best stick her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, in that you are astray; &#8217;twere best pound you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SPEED.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, sir, less than a pound shall serve me for carrying your letter.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You mistake; I mean the pound&#8212;a pinfold.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SPEED.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>From a pound to a pin? Fold it over and over,</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis threefold too little for carrying a letter to your lover.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But what said she?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Speed nods, and Proteus looks at him questioningly.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SPEED.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nod-ay&#8212;why, that&#8217;s &#8220;noddy.&#8221;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SPEED.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You mistook, sir: I say, she did nod; and you ask me if she did nod, and I say, &#8220;Ay.&#8221;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And that set together is &#8220;noddy.&#8221;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SPEED.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now you have taken the pains to set it together, take it for your pains.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, no, you shall have it for bearing the letter.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SPEED.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, I perceive I must be fain to bear with you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, sir, how do you bear with me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SPEED.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, sir, the letter, very orderly, having nothing but the word &#8220;noddy&#8221; for my pains.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Beshrew me, but you have a quick wit.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SPEED.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And yet it cannot overtake your slow purse.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, come, open the matter in brief: what said she?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SPEED.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Open your purse, that the money and the matter may be both at once deliver&#8217;d.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, sir, here is for your pains. What said she?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SPEED.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Truly, sir, I think You&#8217;ll hardly win her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why? Couldst thou perceive so much from her?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SPEED.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, I could perceive nothing at all from her; no, not so much as a ducat for delivering your letter: and being so hard to me that brought your mind, I fear she&#8217;ll prove as hard to you in telling your mind. Give her no token but stones, for she&#8217;s as hard as steel.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What said she? Nothing?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SPEED.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, not so much as &#8220;Take this for thy pains.&#8221; To testify your bounty, I thank you, you have testern&#8217;d me; in requital whereof, henceforth carry your letters yourself: and so, sir, I&#8217;ll commend you to my master.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go, go, be gone, to save your ship from wrack,</LINE>
<LINE>Which cannot perish having thee aboard,</LINE>
<LINE>Being destin&#8217;d to a drier death on shore.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exit Speed.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>I must go send some better messenger:</LINE>
<LINE>I fear my Julia would not deign my lines,</LINE>
<LINE>Receiving them from such a worthless post.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SCENEPERSONAE>(Julia, Lucetta)</SCENEPERSONAE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Julia and Lucetta.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JUL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But say, Lucetta, now we are alone,</LINE>
<LINE>Wouldst thou then counsel me to fall in love?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, madam, so you stumble not unheedfully.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JUL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Of all the fair resort of gentlemen</LINE>
<LINE>That every day with parle encounter me,</LINE>
<LINE>In thy opinion which is worthiest love?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Please you repeat their names, I&#8217;ll show my mind</LINE>
<LINE>According to my shallow simple skill.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JUL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What think&#8217;st thou of the fair Sir Eglamour?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As of a knight well-spoken, neat, and fine;</LINE>
<LINE>But were I you, he never should be mine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JUL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What think&#8217;st thou of the rich Mercatio?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well of his wealth; but of himself, so, so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JUL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What think&#8217;st thou of the gentle Proteus?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Lord, Lord! To see what folly reigns in us!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JUL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How now? What means this passion at his name?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pardon, dear madam, &#8217;tis a passing shame</LINE>
<LINE>That I (unworthy body as I am)</LINE>
<LINE>Should censure thus on lovely gentlemen.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JUL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why not on Proteus, as of all the rest?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then thus: of many good I think him best.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JUL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your reason?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have no other but a woman&#8217;s reason:</LINE>
<LINE>I think him so, because I think him so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JUL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And wouldst thou have me cast my love on him?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay&#8212;if you thought your love not cast away.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JUL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, he, of all the rest, hath never mov&#8217;d me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yet he, of all the rest, I think best loves ye.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JUL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>His little speaking shows his love but small.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fire that&#8217;s closest kept burns most of all.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JUL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>They do not love that do not show their love.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, they love least that let men know their love.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JUL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would I knew his mind.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Peruse this paper, madam.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JUL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8220;To Julia&#8221;&#8212;say, from whom?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That the contents will show.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JUL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Say, say; who gave it thee?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir Valentine&#8217;s page; and sent, I think, from Proteus.</LINE>
<LINE>He would have given it you, but I, being in the way,</LINE>
<LINE>Did in your name receive it; pardon the fault, I pray.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JUL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, by my modesty, a goodly broker!</LINE>
<LINE>Dare you presume to harbor wanton lines?</LINE>
<LINE>To whisper and conspire against my youth?</LINE>
<LINE>Now trust me, &#8217;tis an office of great worth,</LINE>
<LINE>And you an officer fit for the place.</LINE>
<LINE>There! Take the paper; see it be return&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Or else return no more into my sight.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To plead for love deserves more fee than hate.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JUL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Will ye be gone?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="3">That you may ruminate.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JUL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And yet I would I had o&#8217;erlook&#8217;d the letter;</LINE>
<LINE>It were a shame to call her back again,</LINE>
<LINE>And pray her to a fault for which I chid her.</LINE>
<LINE>What &#8217;fool is she, that knows I am a maid,</LINE>
<LINE>And would not force the letter to my view!</LINE>
<LINE>Since maids, in modesty, say &#8220;no&#8221; to that</LINE>
<LINE>Which they would have the profferer construe &#8220;ay.&#8221;</LINE>
<LINE>Fie, fie, how wayward is this foolish love,</LINE>
<LINE>That (like a testy babe) will scratch the nurse</LINE>
<LINE>And presently, all humbled, kiss the rod!</LINE>
<LINE>How churlishly I chid Lucetta hence,</LINE>
<LINE>When willingly I would have had her here!</LINE>
<LINE>How angerly I taught my brow to frown,</LINE>
<LINE>When inward joy enforc&#8217;d my heart to smile!</LINE>
<LINE>My penance is, to call Lucetta back</LINE>
<LINE>And ask remission for my folly past.</LINE>
<LINE>What ho! Lucetta!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Lucetta.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>

<LINE offset="4">What would your ladyship?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JUL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is&#8217;t near dinner-time?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">I would it were,</LINE>
<LINE>That you might kill your stomach on your meat,</LINE>
<LINE>And not upon your maid.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JUL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">What is&#8217;t that you</LINE>
<LINE>Took up so gingerly?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Nothing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JUL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">Why didst thou stoop then?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To take a paper up that I let fall.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JUL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And is that paper nothing?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Nothing concerning me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JUL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then let it lie for those that it concerns.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Madam, it will not lie where it concerns</LINE>
<LINE>Unless it have a false interpreter.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JUL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Some love of yours hath writ to you in rhyme.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That I might sing it, madam, to a tune:</LINE>
<LINE>Give me a note, your ladyship can set.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JUL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As little by such toys as may be possible:</LINE>
<LINE>Best sing it to the tune of &#8220;Light o&#8217; love.&#8221;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is too heavy for so light a tune.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JUL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Heavy? Belike it hath some burden then?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay; and melodious were it, would you sing it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JUL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And why not you?</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Takes the letter.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE offset="4">How now, minion?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Keep tune there still, so you will sing it out.</LINE>
<LINE>And yet methinks I do not like this tune.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JUL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You do not?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="3">No, madam, &#8217;tis too sharp.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JUL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You, minion, are too saucy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, now you are too flat,</LINE>
<LINE>And mar the concord with too harsh a descant:</LINE>
<LINE>There wanteth but a mean to fill your song.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JUL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The mean is drown&#8217;d with your unruly bass.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Indeed I bid the base for Proteus.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JUL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This babble shall not henceforth trouble me.</LINE>
<LINE>Here is a coil with protestation!</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Tears the letter.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Go, get you gone; and let the papers lie:</LINE>
<LINE>You would be fing&#8217;ring them, to anger me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Nay, would I were so ang&#8217;red with the same.</LINE>
<LINE>O hateful hands, to tear such loving words!</LINE>
<LINE>Injurious wasps, to feed on such sweet honey,</LINE>
<LINE>And kill the bees that yield it with your stings!</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll kiss each several paper for amends.</LINE>
<LINE>Look, here is writ &#8220;kind Julia.&#8221; Unkind Julia,</LINE>
<LINE>As in revenge of thy ingratitude,</LINE>
<LINE>I throw thy name against the bruising stones,</LINE>
<LINE>Trampling contemptuously on thy disdain.</LINE>
<LINE>And here is writ &#8220;love-wounded Proteus.&#8221;</LINE>
<LINE>Poor wounded name: my bosom as a bed</LINE>
<LINE>Shall lodge thee till thy wound be throughly heal&#8217;d;</LINE>
<LINE>And thus I search it with a sovereign kiss.</LINE>
<LINE>But twice, or thrice, was &#8220;Proteus&#8221; written down:</LINE>
<LINE>Be calm, good wind, blow not a word away</LINE>
<LINE>Till I have found each letter in the letter,</LINE>
<LINE>Except mine own name; that, some whirlwind bear</LINE>
<LINE>Unto a ragged, fearful, hanging rock,</LINE>
<LINE>And throw it thence into the raging sea.</LINE>
<LINE>Lo, here in one line is his name twice writ,</LINE>
<LINE>&#8220;Poor forlorn Proteus, passionate Proteus:</LINE>
<LINE>To the sweet Julia&#8221;&#8212;that I&#8217;ll tear away&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>And yet I will not, sith so prettily</LINE>
<LINE>He couples it to his complaining names.</LINE>
<LINE>Thus will I fold them one upon another;</LINE>
<LINE>Now kiss, embrace, contend, do what you will.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tell me, Panthino, what sad talk was that</LINE>
<LINE>Wherewith my brother held you in the cloister?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;Twas of his nephew Proteus, your son.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, what of him?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">He wond&#8217;red that your lordship</LINE>
<LINE>Would suffer him to spend his youth at home,</LINE>
<LINE>While other men, of slender reputation,</LINE>
<LINE>Put forth their sons to seek preferment out:</LINE>
<LINE>Some to the wars, to try their fortune there;</LINE>
<LINE>Some to discover islands far away;</LINE>
<LINE>Some to the studious universities.</LINE>
<LINE>For any or for all these exercises</LINE>
<LINE>He said that Proteus, your son, was meet;</LINE>
<LINE>And did request me to importune you</LINE>
<LINE>To let him spend his time no more at home,</LINE>
<LINE>Which would be great impeachment to his age,</LINE>
<LINE>In having known no travel in his youth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nor need&#8217;st thou much importune me to that</LINE>
<LINE>Whereon this month I have been hammering.</LINE>
<LINE>I have consider&#8217;d well his loss of time,</LINE>
<LINE>And how he cannot be a perfect man,</LINE>
<LINE>Not being tried and tutor&#8217;d in the world:</LINE>
<LINE>Experience is by industry achiev&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>And perfected by the swift course of time.</LINE>
<LINE>Then tell me, whither were I best to send him?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I think your lordship is not ignorant</LINE>
<LINE>How his companion, youthful Valentine,</LINE>

<SPEAKER>ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know it well.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;Twere good, I think, your lordship sent him thither:</LINE>
<LINE>There shall he practice tilts and tournaments,</LINE>
<LINE>Hear sweet discourse, converse with noblemen,</LINE>
<LINE>And be in eye of every exercise</LINE>
<LINE>Worthy his youth and nobleness of birth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I like thy counsel; well hast thou advis&#8217;d;</LINE>
<LINE>And that thou mayst perceive how well I like it,</LINE>
<LINE>The execution of it shall make known:</LINE>

<LINE>Wishing me with him, partner of his fortune.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As one relying on your lordship&#8217;s will,</LINE>
<LINE>And not depending on his friendly wish.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My will is something sorted with his wish:</LINE>
<LINE>Muse not that I thus suddenly proceed;</LINE>
<LINE>For what I will, I will, and there an end.</LINE>
<LINE>I am resolv&#8217;d that thou shalt spend some time</LINE>
<LINE>With Valentinus in the Emperor&#8217;s court;</LINE>
<LINE>What maintenance he from his friends receives,</LINE>

<LINE>Thus have I shunn&#8217;d the fire for fear of burning,</LINE>

<LINE>I fear&#8217;d to show my father Julia&#8217;s letter,</LINE>
<LINE>Lest he should take exceptions to my love,</LINE>
<LINE>And with the vantage of mine own excuse</LINE>
<LINE>Hath he excepted most against my love.</LINE>
<LINE>O, how this spring of love resembleth</LINE>

<LINE>How now, sirrah?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SPEED.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She is not within hearing, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, sir, who bade you call her?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SPEED.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your worship, sir, or else I mistook.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well&#8212;You&#8217;ll still be too forward.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SPEED.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And yet I was last chidden for being too slow.</LINE>

<LINE>Go to, sir; tell me, do you know Madam Silvia?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>She that your worship loves?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, how know you that I am in love?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SPEED.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, by these special marks: first, you have learn&#8217;d, like Sir Proteus, to wreathe your arms, like a malecontent; to relish a love-song, like a robin-redbreast; to walk alone, like one that had the pestilence; to sigh, like a schoolboy that had lost his A B C; to weep, like a young wench that had buried her grandam; to fast, like one that takes diet; to watch, like one that fears robbing; to speak puling, like a beggar at Hallowmas. You were wont, when you laugh&#8217;d, to crow like a cock; when you walk&#8217;d, to walk like one of the lions; when you fasted, it was presently after dinner; when you look&#8217;d sadly, it was for want of money: and now you are metamorphis&#8217;d with a mistress, that when I look on you, I can hardly think you my master.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Are all these things perceiv&#8217;d in me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SPEED.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>They are all perceiv&#8217;d without ye.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Without me? They cannot.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SPEED.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Without you? Nay, that&#8217;s certain; for without you were so simple, none else would: but you are so without these follies, that these follies are within you, and shine through you like the water in an urinal, that not an eye that sees you but is a physician to comment on your malady.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But tell me: dost thou know my lady Silvia?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SPEED.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She that you gaze on so as she sits at supper?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hast thou observ&#8217;d that? Even she I mean.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SPEED.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, sir, I know her not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Dost thou know her by my gazing on her, and yet know&#8217;st her not?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SPEED.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is she not hard-favor&#8217;d, sir?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not so fair, boy, as well-favor&#8217;d.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SPEED.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, I know that well enough.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What dost thou know?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SPEED.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That she is not so fair as (of you) well favor&#8217;d.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I mean that her beauty is exquisite, but her favor infinite.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SPEED.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That&#8217;s because the one is painted, and the other out of all count.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How painted? And how out of count?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SPEED.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, sir, so painted to make her fair, that no man counts of her beauty.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How esteem&#8217;st thou me? I account of her beauty.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SPEED.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You never saw her since she was deform&#8217;d.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How long hath she been deform&#8217;d?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SPEED.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ever since you lov&#8217;d her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have lov&#8217;d her ever since I saw her, and still I see her beautiful.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SPEED.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If you love her, you cannot see her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SPEED.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Because Love is blind. O that you had mine eyes, or your own eyes had the lights they were wont to have when you chid at Sir Proteus for going ungarter&#8217;d!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What should I see then?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SPEED.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your own present folly, and her passing deformity: for he, being in love, could not see to garter his hose; and you, being in love, cannot see to put on your hose.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Belike, boy, then you are in love&#8212;for last morning you could not see to wipe my shoes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SPEED.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>True, sir; I was in love with my bed. I thank you, you swing&#8217;d me for my love, which makes me the bolder to chide you for yours.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In conclusion, I stand affected to her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SPEED.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would you were set, so your affection would cease.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Last night she enjoin&#8217;d me to write some lines to one she loves.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SPEED.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And have you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SPEED.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Are they not lamely writ?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, boy, but as well as I can do them.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Silvia.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEAKER>SIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I thank you, gentle servant&#8212;&#8217;tis very clerkly done.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now trust me, madam, it came hardly off;</LINE>
<LINE>For being ignorant to whom it goes,</LINE>
<LINE>I writ at random, very doubtfully.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Perchance you think too much of so much pains?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, madam; so it stead you, I will write</LINE>
<LINE>(Please you command) a thousand times as much;</LINE>

<LINE>A pretty period! Well&#8212;I guess the sequel;</LINE>

<LINE>Meaning henceforth to trouble you no more.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What means your ladyship? Do you not like it?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Yes, yes; the lines are very quaintly writ,</LINE>
<LINE>But (since unwillingly) take them again.</LINE>
<LINE>Nay, take them.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Madam, they are for you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, ay; you writ them, sir, at my request,</LINE>
<LINE>But I will none of them; they are for you.</LINE>
<LINE>I would have had them writ more movingly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Please you, I&#8217;ll write your ladyship another.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>My master sues to her; and she hath taught her suitor,</LINE>
<LINE>He being her pupil, to become her tutor.</LINE>
<LINE>O excellent device, was there ever heard a better,</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How now, sir? What are you reasoning with yourself?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAUNCE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, &#8217;twill be this hour ere I have done weeping; all the kind of the Launces have this very fault. I have receiv&#8217;d my proportion, like the prodigious son, and am going with Sir Proteus to the Imperial&#8217;s court. I think Crab my dog be the sourest-natur&#8217;d dog that lives: my mother weeping, my father wailing, my sister crying, our maid howling, our cat wringing her hands, and all our house in a great perplexity, yet did not this cruel-hearted cur shed one tear. He is a stone, a very pibble stone, and has no more pity in him than a dog. A Jew would have wept to have seen our parting; why, my grandam, having no eyes, look you, wept herself blind at my parting. Nay, I&#8217;ll show you the manner of it. This shoe is my father; no, this left shoe is my father; no, no, this left shoe is my mother; nay, that cannot be so neither; yes, it is so, it is so&#8212;it hath the worser sole. This shoe, with the hole in it, is my mother, and this my father&#8212;a vengeance on&#8217;t! There &#8217;tis. Now, sir, this staff is my sister, for, look you, she is as white as a lily and as small as a wand. This hat is Nan, our maid. I am the dog&#8212;no, the dog is himself, and I am the dog&#8212;O! The dog is me, and I am myself; ay, so, so. Now come I to my father: &#8220;Father, your blessing.&#8221; Now should not the shoe speak a word for weeping; now should I kiss my father; well, he weeps on. Now come I to my mother. O that she could speak now like a wood woman! Well, I kiss her; why, there &#8217;tis; here&#8217;s my mother&#8217;s breath up and down. Now come I to my sister; mark the moan she makes. Now the dog all this while sheds not a tear, nor speaks a word; but see how I lay the dust with my tears.</LINE>

<LINE>Comes all the praises that I now bestow),</LINE>

<LINE>Whose high imperious thoughts have punish&#8217;d me</LINE>
<LINE>With bitter fasts, with penitential groans,</LINE>
<LINE>With nightly tears, and daily heart-sore sighs,</LINE>
<LINE>For in revenge of my contempt of love,</LINE>
<LINE>Love hath chas&#8217;d sleep from my enthralled eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>And made them watchers of mine own heart&#8217;s sorrow.</LINE>
<LINE>O gentle Proteus, Love&#8217;s a mighty lord,</LINE>

<LINE>There is no woe to his correction,</LINE>

<LINE>Plotted and &#8217;greed on for my happiness.</LINE>
<LINE>Good Proteus, go with me to my chamber,</LINE>
<LINE>In these affairs to aid me with thy counsel.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>PRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go on before; I shall inquire you forth.</LINE>
<LINE>I must unto the road, to disembark</LINE>
<LINE>Some necessaries that I needs must use,</LINE>

<LINE>Will you make haste?</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exit Valentine.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Even as one heat another heat expels,</LINE>
<LINE>Or as one nail by strength drives out another,</LINE>
<LINE>So the remembrance of my former love</LINE>
<LINE>Is by a newer object quite forgotten.</LINE>
<LINE>Is it mine eye, or Valentinus&#8217; praise,</LINE>
<LINE>Her true perfection, or my false transgression,</LINE>
<LINE>That makes me reasonless, to reason thus?</LINE>
<LINE>She is fair; and so is Julia that I love</LINE>
<LINE>(That I did love, for now my love is thaw&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Which like a waxen image &#8217;gainst a fire</LINE>
<LINE>Bears no impression of the thing it was).</LINE>
<LINE>Methinks my zeal to Valentine is cold,</LINE>
<LINE>And that I love him not as I was wont:</LINE>
<LINE>O, but I love his lady too too much,</LINE>
<LINE>And that&#8217;s the reason I love him so little.</LINE>
<LINE>How shall I dote on her with more advice,</LINE>
<LINE>That thus without advice begin to love her?</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis but her picture I have yet beheld,</LINE>
<LINE>And that hath dazzled my reason&#8217;s light;</LINE>
<LINE>But when I look on her perfections,</LINE>
<LINE>There is no reason but I shall be blind.</LINE>
<LINE>If I can check my erring love, I will;</LINE>
<LINE>If not, to compass her I&#8217;ll use my skill.</LINE>

<LINE>Launce, by mine honesty, welcome to Milan.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAUNCE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Forswear not thyself, sweet youth, for I am not welcome. I reckon this always, that a man is never undone till he be hang&#8217;d, nor never welcome to a place till some certain shot be paid and the hostess say &#8220;Welcome.&#8221;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SPEED.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come on, you madcap, I&#8217;ll to the alehouse with you presently; where, for one shot of five pence, thou shalt have five thousand welcomes. But, sirrah, how did thy master part with Madam Julia?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAUNCE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, after they clos&#8217;d in earnest, they parted very fairly in jest.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SPEED.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, are they broken?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAUNCE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, they are both as whole as a fish.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SPEED.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why then, how stands the matter with them?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAUNCE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, thus: when it stands well with him, it stands well with her.</LINE>

<LINE>Ay, and what I do too. Look thee, I&#8217;ll but lean, and my staff understands me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SPEED.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It stands under thee indeed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAUNCE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, stand-under and under-stand is all one.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SPEED.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But tell me true, will&#8217;t be a match?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAUNCE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ask my dog. If he say ay, it will; if he say no, it will; if he shake his tail and say nothing, it will.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SPEED.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The conclusion is then, that it will.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAUNCE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou shalt never get such a secret from me but by a parable.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SPEED.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis well that I get it so. But, Launce, how say&#8217;st thou that my master is become a notable lover?</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAUNCE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I never knew him otherwise.</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAUNCE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A notable lubber&#8212;as thou reportest him to be.</LINE>

<LINE>I tell thee, my master is become a hot lover.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAUNCE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, I tell thee, I care not, though he burn himself in love. If thou wilt, go with me to the alehouse; if not, thou art an Hebrew, a Jew, and not worth the name of a Christian.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SPEED.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAUNCE.</SPEAKER>

<LINE>To wrong my friend, I shall be much forsworn.</LINE>
<LINE>And ev&#8217;n that pow&#8217;r which gave me first my oath</LINE>
<LINE>Provokes me to this threefold perjury.</LINE>
<LINE>Love bade me swear, and Love bids me forswear.</LINE>
<LINE>O sweet-suggesting Love, if thou hast sinn&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Teach me, thy tempted subject, to excuse it!</LINE>
<LINE>At first I did adore a twinkling star,</LINE>
<LINE>But now I worship a celestial sun.</LINE>
<LINE>Unheedful vows may heedfully be broken,</LINE>
<LINE>And he wants wit that wants resolved will</LINE>
<LINE>To learn his wit t&#8217; exchange the bad for better.</LINE>
<LINE>Fie, fie, unreverend tongue, to call her bad,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose sovereignty so oft thou hast preferr&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>With twenty thousand soul-confirming oaths.</LINE>
<LINE>I cannot leave to love, and yet I do;</LINE>
<LINE>But there I leave to love where I should love.</LINE>
<LINE>Julia I lose, and Valentine I lose:</LINE>
<LINE>If I keep them, I needs must lose myself;</LINE>
<LINE>If I lose them, thus find I by their loss&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>For Valentine, myself; for Julia, Silvia.</LINE>
<LINE>I to myself am dearer than a friend,</LINE>
<LINE>For love is still most precious in itself,</LINE>
<LINE>And Silvia (witness heaven, that made her fair)</LINE>
<LINE>Shows Julia but a swarthy Ethiope.</LINE>
<LINE>I will forget that Julia is alive,</LINE>
<LINE>Rememb&#8217;ring that my love to her is dead;</LINE>
<LINE>And Valentine I&#8217;ll hold an enemy,</LINE>
<LINE>Aiming at Silvia as a sweeter friend.</LINE>
<LINE>I cannot now prove constant to myself,</LINE>
<LINE>Without some treachery us&#8217;d to Valentine.</LINE>
<LINE>This night he meaneth with a corded ladder</LINE>

<LINE>Of their disguising and pretended flight,</LINE>
<LINE>Who, all enrag&#8217;d, will banish Valentine;</LINE>
<LINE>For Thurio, he intends, shall wed his daughter;</LINE>
<LINE>But, Valentine being gone, I&#8217;ll quickly cross</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alas, the way is wearisome and long.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JUL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A true-devoted pilgrim is not weary</LINE>
<LINE>To measure kingdoms with his feeble steps;</LINE>
<LINE>Much less shall she that hath Love&#8217;s wings to fly,</LINE>
<LINE>And when the flight is made to one so dear,</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Better forbear till Proteus make return.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JUL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, know&#8217;st thou not his looks are my soul&#8217;s food?</LINE>
<LINE>Pity the dearth that I have pined in,</LINE>
<LINE>By longing for that food so long a time.</LINE>
<LINE>Didst thou but know the inly touch of love,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou wouldst as soon go kindle fire with snow</LINE>
<LINE>As seek to quench the fire of love with words.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do not seek to quench your love&#8217;s hot fire,</LINE>
<LINE>But qualify the fire&#8217;s extreme rage,</LINE>
<LINE>Lest it should burn above the bounds of reason.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JUL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The more thou dam&#8217;st it up, the more it burns:</LINE>
<LINE>The current that with gentle murmur glides,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou know&#8217;st, being stopp&#8217;d, impatiently doth rage;</LINE>
<LINE>But when his fair course is not hindered,</LINE>
<LINE>He makes sweet music with th&#8217; enamell&#8217;d stones,</LINE>
<LINE>Giving a gentle kiss to every sedge</LINE>
<LINE>He overtaketh in his pilgrimage;</LINE>
<LINE>And so by many winding nooks he strays</LINE>
<LINE>With willing sport to the wild ocean.</LINE>
<LINE>Then let me go, and hinder not my course:</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll be as patient as a gentle stream,</LINE>
<LINE>And make a pastime of each weary step,</LINE>
<LINE>Till the last step have brought me to my love,</LINE>
<LINE>And there I&#8217;ll rest, as after much turmoil</LINE>
<LINE>A blessed soul doth in Elysium.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But in what habit will you go along?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JUL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not like a woman, for I would prevent</LINE>
<LINE>The loose encounters of lascivious men:</LINE>
<LINE>Gentle Lucetta, fit me with such weeds</LINE>
<LINE>As may beseem some well-reputed page.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why then your ladyship must cut your hair.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JUL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, girl, I&#8217;ll knit it up in silken strings,</LINE>
<LINE>With twenty odd-conceited true-love knots:</LINE>
<LINE>To be fantastic may become a youth</LINE>
<LINE>Of greater time than I shall show to be.</LINE>

<LINE>What fashion, madam, shall I make your breeches?</LINE>

<LINE>What compass will you wear your farthingale?&#8221;</LINE>
<LINE>Why, ev&#8217;n what fashion thou best likes, Lucetta.</LINE>

<LINE>Out, out, Lucetta, that will be ill-favor&#8217;d.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A round hose, madam, now&#8217;s not worth a pin,</LINE>
<LINE>Unless you have a codpiece to stick pins on.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JUL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Lucetta, as thou lov&#8217;st me, let me have</LINE>
<LINE>What thou think&#8217;st meet, and is most mannerly.</LINE>
<LINE>But tell me, wench, how will the world repute me</LINE>
<LINE>For undertaking so unstaid a journey?</LINE>
<LINE>I fear me it will make me scandaliz&#8217;d.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If you think so, then stay at home and go not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JUL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, that I will not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then never dream on infamy, but go.</LINE>
<LINE>If Proteus like your journey when you come,</LINE>
<LINE>No matter who&#8217;s displeas&#8217;d when you are gone:</LINE>
<LINE>I fear me he will scarce be pleas&#8217;d withal.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JUL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That is the least, Lucetta, of my fear:</LINE>
<LINE>A thousand oaths, an ocean of his tears,</LINE>
<LINE>And instances of infinite of love,</LINE>
<LINE>Warrant me welcome to my Proteus.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>All these are servants to deceitful men.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JUL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Base men, that use them to so base effect!</LINE>
<LINE>But truer stars did govern Proteus&#8217; birth:</LINE>
<LINE>His words are bonds, his oaths are oracles,</LINE>
<LINE>His love sincere, his thoughts immaculate,</LINE>
<LINE>His tears pure messengers sent from his heart,</LINE>
<LINE>His heart as far from fraud as heaven from earth.</LINE>

<LINE>Now, as thou lov&#8217;st me, do him not that wrong,</LINE>
<LINE>To bear a hard opinion of his truth:</LINE>
<LINE>Only deserve my love by loving him,</LINE>
<LINE>And presently go with me to my chamber,</LINE>
<LINE>To take a note of what I stand in need of,</LINE>
<LINE>To furnish me upon my longing journey.</LINE>
<LINE>All that is mine I leave at thy dispose,</LINE>
<LINE>My goods, my lands, my reputation;</LINE>

<LINE>Now tell me, Proteus, what&#8217;s your will with me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My gracious lord, that which I would discover</LINE>
<LINE>The law of friendship bids me to conceal,</LINE>
<LINE>But when I call to mind your gracious favors</LINE>
<LINE>Done to me (undeserving as I am),</LINE>
<LINE>My duty pricks me on to utter that</LINE>
<LINE>Which else no worldly good should draw from me.</LINE>
<LINE>Know, worthy prince, Sir Valentine, my friend,</LINE>
<LINE>This night intends to steal away your daughter;</LINE>
<LINE>Myself am one made privy to the plot.</LINE>
<LINE>I know you have determin&#8217;d to bestow her</LINE>
<LINE>On Thurio, whom your gentle daughter hates,</LINE>
<LINE>And should she thus be stol&#8217;n away from you,</LINE>
<LINE>It would be much vexation to your age.</LINE>
<LINE>Thus, for my duty&#8217;s sake, I rather chose</LINE>
<LINE>To cross my friend in his intended drift,</LINE>
<LINE>Than, by concealing it, heap on your head</LINE>
<LINE>A pack of sorrows which would press you down,</LINE>
<LINE>Being unprevented, to your timeless grave.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Proteus, I thank thee for thine honest care,</LINE>
<LINE>Which to requite, command me while I live.</LINE>
<LINE>This love of theirs myself have often seen,</LINE>
<LINE>Haply when they have judg&#8217;d me fast asleep,</LINE>
<LINE>And oftentimes have purpos&#8217;d to forbid</LINE>
<LINE>Sir Valentine her company and my court;</LINE>
<LINE>But fearing lest my jealous aim might err,</LINE>
<LINE>And so, unworthily, disgrace the man</LINE>
<LINE>(A rashness that I ever yet have shunn&#8217;d),</LINE>
<LINE>I gave him gentle looks, thereby to find</LINE>
<LINE>That which thyself hast now disclos&#8217;d to me.</LINE>
<LINE>And that thou mayst perceive my fear of this,</LINE>
<LINE>Knowing that tender youth is soon suggested,</LINE>
<LINE>I nightly lodge her in an upper tow&#8217;r,</LINE>
<LINE>The key whereof myself have ever kept;</LINE>
<LINE>And thence she cannot be convey&#8217;d away.</LINE>

<LINE>Where (if it please you) you may intercept him.</LINE>
<LINE>But, good my lord, do it so cunningly</LINE>
<LINE>That my discovery be not aimed at:</LINE>

<LINE>I know it well, my lord, and sure the match</LINE>
<LINE>Were rich and honorable; besides, the gentleman</LINE>

<LINE>Beseeming such a wife as your fair daughter.</LINE>
<LINE>Cannot your Grace win her to fancy him?</LINE>

<LINE>No, trust me, she is peevish, sullen, froward,</LINE>
<LINE>Proud, disobedient, stubborn, lacking duty,</LINE>
<LINE>Neither regarding that she is my child,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor fearing me as if I were her father;</LINE>
<LINE>And may I say to thee, this pride of hers</LINE>
<LINE>(Upon advice) hath drawn my love from her,</LINE>

<LINE>If she do frown, &#8217;tis not in hate of you,</LINE>
<LINE>But rather to beget more love in you.</LINE>
<LINE>If she do chide, &#8217;tis not to have you gone,</LINE>
<LINE>For why, the fools are mad, if left alone.</LINE>
<LINE>Take no repulse, what ever she doth say;</LINE>
<LINE>For &#8220;get you gone,&#8221; she doth not mean &#8220;away!&#8221;</LINE>
<LINE>Flatter and praise, commend, extol their graces;</LINE>
<LINE>Though ne&#8217;er so black, say they have angels&#8217; faces.</LINE>
<LINE>That man that hath a tongue, I say is no man,</LINE>
<LINE>If with his tongue he cannot win a woman.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But she I mean is promis&#8217;d by her friends</LINE>
<LINE>Unto a youthful gentleman of worth,</LINE>
<LINE>And kept severely from resort of men,</LINE>
<LINE>That no man hath access by day to her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why then I would resort to her by night.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, but the doors be lock&#8217;d, and keys kept safe,</LINE>
<LINE>That no man hath recourse to her by night.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What lets but one may enter at her window?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Her chamber is aloft, far from the ground,</LINE>
<LINE>And built so shelving that one cannot climb it</LINE>
<LINE>Without apparent hazard of his life.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why then a ladder, quaintly made of cords,</LINE>
<LINE>To cast up, with a pair of anchoring hooks,</LINE>
<LINE>Would serve to scale another Hero&#8217;s tow&#8217;r,</LINE>
<LINE>So bold Leander would adventure it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now as thou art a gentleman of blood,</LINE>
<LINE>Advise me where I may have such a ladder.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>When would you use it? Pray, sir, tell me that.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This very night; for Love is like a child,</LINE>
<LINE>That longs for every thing that he can come by.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By seven a&#8217; clock I&#8217;ll get you such a ladder.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But hark thee: I will go to her alone.</LINE>
<LINE>How shall I best convey the ladder thither?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It will be light, my lord, that you may bear it</LINE>
<LINE>Under a cloak that is of any length.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A cloak as long as thine will serve the turn?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Ay, my good lord.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>DUKE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Then let me see thy cloak&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll get me one of such another length.</LINE>

<LINE>Why, any cloak will serve the turn, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How shall I fashion me to wear a cloak?</LINE>
<LINE>I pray thee let me feel thy cloak upon me.</LINE>
<LINE>What letter is this same? What&#8217;s here? &#8220;To Silvia&#8221;?</LINE>
<LINE>And here an engine fit for my proceeding!</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll be so bold to break the seal for once.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Reads.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE><RECITE>&#8220;My thoughts do harbor with my Silvia nightly,</RECITE></LINE>

<LINE><RECITE>O, could their master come and go as lightly,</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>Himself would lodge where, senseless, they are lying!</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>My herald thoughts in thy pure bosom rest them,</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>While I, their king, that thither them importune,</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>Do curse the grace that with such grace hath blest them,</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>Because myself do want my servants&#8217; fortune.</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>I curse myself, for they are sent by me,</RECITE></LINE>

<LINE><RECITE>&#8220;Silvia, this night I will enfranchise thee.&#8221;</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis so; and here&#8217;s the ladder for the purpose.</LINE>
<LINE>Why, Pha&#235;ton (for thou art Merops&#8217; son),</LINE>
<LINE>Wilt thou aspire to guide the heavenly car,</LINE>
<LINE>And with thy daring folly burn the world?</LINE>
<LINE>Wilt thou reach stars, because they shine on thee?</LINE>
<LINE>Go, base intruder, overweening slave,</LINE>
<LINE>Bestow thy fawning smiles on equal mates,</LINE>
<LINE>And think my patience (more than thy desert)</LINE>
<LINE>Is privilege for thy departure hence.</LINE>
<LINE>Thank me for this more than for all the favors</LINE>
<LINE>Which (all too much) I have bestowed on thee.</LINE>
<LINE>But if thou linger in my territories</LINE>
<LINE>Longer than swiftest expedition</LINE>
<LINE>Will give thee time to leave our royal court,</LINE>
<LINE>By heaven, my wrath shall far exceed the love</LINE>
<LINE>I ever bore my daughter, or thyself.</LINE>
<LINE>Be gone, I will not hear thy vain excuse,</LINE>
<LINE>But as thou lov&#8217;st thy life, make speed from hence.</LINE>

<LINE>And why not death, rather than living torment?</LINE>
<LINE>To die is to be banish&#8217;d from myself,</LINE>
<LINE>And Silvia is myself: banish&#8217;d from her</LINE>
<LINE>Is self from self, a deadly banishment.</LINE>
<LINE>What light is light, if Silvia be not seen?</LINE>
<LINE>What joy is joy, if Silvia be not by?</LINE>
<LINE>Unless it be to think that she is by,</LINE>
<LINE>And feed upon the shadow of perfection.</LINE>
<LINE>Except I be by Silvia in the night,</LINE>
<LINE>There is no music in the nightingale;</LINE>
<LINE>Unless I look on Silvia in the day,</LINE>
<LINE>There is no day for me to look upon.</LINE>
<LINE>She is my essence, and I leave to be,</LINE>
<LINE>If I be not by her fair influence</LINE>
<LINE>Foster&#8217;d, illumin&#8217;d, cherish&#8217;d, kept alive.</LINE>
<LINE>I fly not death, to fly his deadly doom:</LINE>

<LINE>A sea of melting pearl, which some call tears;</LINE>
<LINE>Those at her father&#8217;s churlish feet she tender&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>With them, upon her knees, her humble self,</LINE>
<LINE>Wringing her hands, whose whiteness so became them</LINE>
<LINE>As if but now they waxed pale for woe:</LINE>
<LINE>But neither bended knees, pure hands held up,</LINE>
<LINE>Sad sighs, deep groans, nor silver-shedding tears</LINE>
<LINE>Could penetrate her uncompassionate sire;</LINE>
<LINE>But Valentine, if he be ta&#8217;en, must die.</LINE>
<LINE>Besides, her intercession chaf&#8217;d him so,</LINE>

<SPEAKER>LAUNCE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am but a fool, look you, and yet I have the wit to think my master is a kind of a knave; but that&#8217;s all one, if he be but one knave. He lives not now that knows me to be in love, yet I am in love, but a team of horse shall not pluck that from me; nor who &#8217;tis I love; and yet &#8217;tis a woman; but what woman, I will not tell myself; and yet &#8217;tis a milkmaid; yet &#8217;tis not a maid, for she hath had gossips; yet &#8217;tis a maid, for she is her master&#8217;s maid, and serves for wages. She hath more qualities than a water-spaniel, which is much in a bare Christian.</LINE>

<LINE>Here is the cate-log of her condition. &#8220;Inprimis, She can fetch and carry.&#8221; Why, a horse can do no more; nay, a horse cannot fetch, but only carry, therefore is she better than a jade. &#8220;Item, She can milk.&#8221; Look you, a sweet virtue in a maid with clean hands.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Duke, Thurio.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir Thurio, fear not but that she will love you</LINE>
<LINE>Now Valentine is banish&#8217;d from her sight.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Since his exile she hath despis&#8217;d me most,</LINE>
<LINE>Forsworn my company, and rail&#8217;d at me,</LINE>
<LINE>That I am desperate of obtaining her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This weak impress of love is as a figure</LINE>
<LINE>Trenched in ice, which with an hour&#8217;s heat</LINE>
<LINE>Dissolves to water, and doth lose his form.</LINE>
<LINE>A little time will melt her frozen thoughts,</LINE>
<LINE>And worthless Valentine shall be forgot.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Proteus.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>How now, Sir Proteus? Is your countryman,</LINE>
<LINE>According to our proclamation, gone?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Gone, my good lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My daughter takes his going grievously.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A little time, my lord, will kill that grief.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So I believe; but Thurio thinks not so.</LINE>
<LINE>Proteus, the good conceit I hold of thee</LINE>
<LINE>(For thou hast shown some sign of good desert)</LINE>
<LINE>Makes me the better to confer with thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Longer than I prove loyal to your Grace</LINE>
<LINE>Let me not live to look upon your Grace.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou know&#8217;st how willingly I would effect</LINE>
<LINE>The match between Sir Thurio and my daughter?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And also, I think, thou art not ignorant</LINE>
<LINE>How she opposes her against my will?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She did, my lord, when Valentine was here.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, and perversely she persevers so.</LINE>
<LINE>What might we do to make the girl forget</LINE>
<LINE>The love of Valentine, and love Sir Thurio?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The best way is to slander Valentine</LINE>
<LINE>With falsehood, cowardice, and poor descent,</LINE>
<LINE>Three things that women highly hold in hate.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, but she&#8217;ll think that it is spoke in hate.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, if his enemy deliver it;</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore it must with circumstance be spoken</LINE>
<LINE>By one whom she esteemeth as his friend.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then you must undertake to slander him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And that, my lord, I shall be loath to do:</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis an ill office for a gentleman,</LINE>
<LINE>Especially against his very friend.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Where your good word cannot advantage him,</LINE>
<LINE>Your slander never can endamage him;</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore the office is indifferent,</LINE>
<LINE>Being entreated to it by your friend.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You have prevail&#8217;d, my lord; if I can do it</LINE>
<LINE>By aught that I can speak in his dispraise,</LINE>
<LINE>She shall not long continue love to him.</LINE>
<LINE>But say this weed her love from Valentine,</LINE>
<LINE>It follows not that she will love Sir Thurio.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Therefore, as you unwind her love from him,</LINE>
<LINE>Lest it should ravel and be good to none,</LINE>
<LINE>You must provide to bottom it on me;</LINE>
<LINE>Which must be done by praising me as much</LINE>
<LINE>As you in worth dispraise Sir Valentine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And, Proteus, we dare trust you in this kind,</LINE>
<LINE>Because we know (on Valentine&#8217;s report)</LINE>
<LINE>You are already Love&#8217;s firm votary,</LINE>
<LINE>And cannot soon revolt and change your mind.</LINE>
<LINE>Upon this warrant shall you have access</LINE>
<LINE>Where you with Silvia may confer at large&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>For she is lumpish, heavy, melancholy,</LINE>
<LINE>And (for your friend&#8217;s sake) will be glad of you&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Where you may temper her by your persuasion</LINE>
<LINE>To hate young Valentine and love my friend.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As much as I can do, I will effect.</LINE>
<LINE>But you, Sir Thurio, are not sharp enough;</LINE>
<LINE>You must lay lime to tangle her desires</LINE>
<LINE>By wailful sonnets, whose composed rhymes</LINE>
<LINE>Should be full-fraught with serviceable vows.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, much is the force of heaven-bred poesy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Say that upon the altar of her beauty</LINE>
<LINE>You sacrifice your tears, your sighs, your heart;</LINE>
<LINE>Write till your ink be dry, and with your tears</LINE>
<LINE>Moist it again, and frame some feeling line</LINE>
<LINE>That may discover such integrity:</LINE>
<LINE>For Orpheus&#8217; lute was strung with poets&#8217; sinews,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose golden touch could soften steel and stones,</LINE>
<LINE>Make tigers tame, and huge leviathans</LINE>
<LINE>Forsake unsounded deeps to dance on sands.</LINE>
<LINE>After your dire-lamenting elegies,</LINE>
<LINE>Visit by night your lady&#8217;s chamber-window</LINE>
<LINE>With some sweet consort; to their instruments</LINE>
<LINE>Tune a deploring dump&#8212;the night&#8217;s dead silence</LINE>
<LINE>Will well become such sweet-complaining grievance.</LINE>
<LINE>This, or else nothing, will inherit her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This discipline shows thou hast been in love.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And thy advice this night I&#8217;ll put in practice:</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore, sweet Proteus, my direction-giver,</LINE>
<LINE>Let us into the city presently</LINE>
<LINE>To sort some gentlemen well skill&#8217;d in music.</LINE>
<LINE>I have a sonnet that will serve the turn</LINE>
<LINE>To give the onset to thy good advice.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>About it, gentlemen!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We&#8217;ll wait upon your Grace till after supper,</LINE>

<LINE>Already have I been false to Valentine,</LINE>
<LINE>And now I must be as unjust to Thurio:</LINE>
<LINE>Under the color of commending him,</LINE>
<LINE>I have access my own love to prefer&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>But Silvia is too fair, too true, too holy,</LINE>
<LINE>To be corrupted with my worthless gifts.</LINE>
<LINE>When I protest true loyalty to her,</LINE>
<LINE>She twits me with my falsehood to my friend;</LINE>
<LINE>When to her beauty I commend my vows,</LINE>
<LINE>She bids me think how I have been forsworn</LINE>
<LINE>In breaking faith with Julia whom I lov&#8217;d;</LINE>
<LINE>And notwithstanding all her sudden quips,</LINE>
<LINE>The least whereof would quell a lover&#8217;s hope,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet, spaniel-like, the more she spurns my love,</LINE>
<LINE>The more it grows, and fawneth on her still.</LINE>

<SCENEPERSONAE>(Launce, Proteus, Julia)</SCENEPERSONAE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Launce with his dog.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LAUNCE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>When a man&#8217;s servant shall play the cur with him, look you, it goes hard: one that I brought up of a puppy; one that I sav&#8217;d from drowning, when three or four of his blind brothers and sisters went to it. I have taught him, even as one would say precisely, &#8220;Thus I would teach a dog.&#8221; I was sent to deliver him as a present to Mistress Silvia from my master; and I came no sooner into the dining-chamber but he steps me to her trencher and steals her capon&#8217;s leg. O, &#8217;tis a foul thing when a cur cannot keep himself in all companies! I would have (as one should say) one that takes upon him to be a dog indeed, to be, as it were, a dog at all things. If I had not had more wit than he, to take a fault upon me that he did, I think verily he had been hang&#8217;d for&#8217;t; sure as I live he had suffer&#8217;d for&#8217;t. You shall judge: he thrusts me himself into the company of three or four gentleman-like dogs, under the Duke&#8217;s table. He had not been there (bless the mark!) a pissing-while, but all the chamber smelt him. &#8220;Out with the dog,&#8221; says one. &#8220;What cur is that?&#8221; says another. &#8220;Whip him out,&#8221; says the third. &#8220;Hang him up,&#8221; says the Duke. I, having been acquainted with the smell before, knew it was Crab, and goes me to the fellow that whips the dogs: &#8220;Friend,&#8221; quoth I, &#8220;you mean to whip the dog?&#8221; &#8220;Ay, marry, do I,&#8221; quoth he. &#8220;You do him the more wrong,&#8221; quoth I, &#8220;&#8217;twas I did the thing you wot of.&#8221; He makes me no more ado, but whips me out of the chamber. How many masters would do this for his servant? Nay, I&#8217;ll be sworn, I have sat in the stocks for puddings he hath stol&#8217;n, otherwise he had been executed; I have stood on the pillory for geese he hath kill&#8217;d, otherwise he had suffer&#8217;d for&#8217;t. Thou think&#8217;st not of this now. Nay, I remember the trick you serv&#8217;d me, when I took my leave of Madam Silvia. Did not I bid thee still mark me, and do as I do? When didst thou see me heave up my leg and make water against a gentlewoman&#8217;s farthingale? Didst thou ever see me do such a trick?</LINE>

<LINE>Ay, sir, the other squirrel was stol&#8217;n from me by the hangman&#8217;s boys in the market-place; and then I offer&#8217;d her mine own, who is a dog as big as ten of yours, and therefore the gift the greater.</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Go, get thee hence, and find my dog again,</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exit Launce.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>A slave, that still an end turns me to shame!</LINE>
<LINE>Sebastian, I have entertained thee,</LINE>
<LINE>Partly that I have need of such a youth</LINE>
<LINE>That can with some discretion do my business&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>For &#8217;tis no trusting to yond foolish lout&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>But chiefly for thy face and thy behavior,</LINE>
<LINE>Which (if my augury deceive me not)</LINE>
<LINE>Witness good bringing up, fortune, and truth:</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore know thou, for this I entertain thee.</LINE>
<LINE>Go presently, and take this ring with thee,</LINE>

<SPEAKER>PRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="3">Wherefore shouldst thou pity her?</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JUL.</SPEAKER>

<LINE>As you do love your lady Silvia:</LINE>
<LINE>She dreams on him that has forgot her love;</LINE>
<LINE>You dote on her that cares not for your love.</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis pity love should be so contrary;</LINE>
<LINE>And thinking on it makes me cry &#8220;alas!&#8221;</LINE>

<LINE>Well, give her that ring and therewithal</LINE>

<LINE>Alas, poor Proteus, thou hast entertain&#8217;d</LINE>

<LINE>Alas, poor fool, why do I pity him</LINE>
<LINE>That with his very heart despiseth me?</LINE>
<LINE>Because he loves her, he despiseth me;</LINE>
<LINE>Because I love him, I must pity him.</LINE>
<LINE>This ring I gave him when he parted from me,</LINE>
<LINE>To bind him to remember my good will;</LINE>
<LINE>And now am I (unhappy messenger)</LINE>
<LINE>To plead for that which I would not obtain,</LINE>
<LINE>To carry that which I would have refus&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>To praise his faith which I would have disprais&#8217;d.</LINE>
<LINE>I am my master&#8217;s true confirmed love;</LINE>
<LINE>But cannot be true servant to my master,</LINE>
<LINE>Unless I prove false traitor to myself.</LINE>
<LINE>Yet will I woo for him, but yet so coldly</LINE>

<LINE>To think upon her woes I do protest</LINE>
<LINE>That I have wept a hundred several times.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Belike she thinks that Proteus hath forsook her?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Is she not passing fair?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JUL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She hath been fairer, madam, than she is:</LINE>
<LINE>When she did think my master lov&#8217;d her well,</LINE>
<LINE>She, in my judgment, was as fair as you;</LINE>
<LINE>But since she did neglect her looking-glass,</LINE>
<LINE>And threw her sun-expelling mask away,</LINE>
<LINE>The air hath starv&#8217;d the roses in her cheeks,</LINE>
<LINE>And pinch&#8217;d the lily-tincture of her face,</LINE>
<LINE>That now she is become as black as I.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How tall was she?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JUL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>About my stature; for at Pentecost,</LINE>
<LINE>When all our pageants of delight were play&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Our youth got me to play the woman&#8217;s part,</LINE>
<LINE>And I was trimm&#8217;d in Madam Julia&#8217;s gown,</LINE>
<LINE>Which served me as fit, by all men&#8217;s judgments,</LINE>
<LINE>As if the garment had been made for me;</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore I know she is about my height.</LINE>
<LINE>And at that time I made her weep agood,</LINE>
<LINE>For I did play a lamentable part.</LINE>
<LINE>Madam, &#8217;twas Ariadne passioning</LINE>
<LINE>For Theseus&#8217; perjury and unjust flight;</LINE>
<LINE>Which I so lively acted with my tears</LINE>
<LINE>That my poor mistress, moved therewithal,</LINE>
<LINE>Wept bitterly; and would I might be dead</LINE>
<LINE>If I in thought felt not her very sorrow.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She is beholding to thee, gentle youth.</LINE>
<LINE>Alas, poor lady, desolate and left!</LINE>
<LINE>I weep myself to think upon thy words.</LINE>
<LINE>Here, youth, there is my purse; I give thee this</LINE>
<LINE>For thy sweet mistress&#8217; sake, because thou lov&#8217;st her.</LINE>
<LINE>Farewell.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit Silvia with Attendants.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>A virtuous gentlewoman, mild and beautiful!</LINE>
<LINE>I hope my master&#8217;s suit will be but cold,</LINE>
<LINE>Since she respects my mistress&#8217; love so much.</LINE>
<LINE>Alas, how love can trifle with itself!</LINE>
<LINE>Here is her picture: let me see; I think</LINE>
<LINE>If I had such a tire, this face of mine</LINE>
<LINE>Were full as lovely as is this of hers;</LINE>
<LINE>And yet the painter flatter&#8217;d her a little,</LINE>
<LINE>Unless I flatter with myself too much.</LINE>
<LINE>Her hair is auburn, mine is perfect yellow:</LINE>
<LINE>If that be all the difference in his love,</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll get me such a color&#8217;d periwig.</LINE>
<LINE>Her eyes are grey as glass, and so are mine;</LINE>
<LINE>Ay, but her forehead&#8217;s low, and mine&#8217;s as high.</LINE>
<LINE>What should it be that he respects in her,</LINE>
<LINE>But I can make respective in myself,</LINE>
<LINE>If this fond Love were not a blinded god?</LINE>
<LINE>Come, shadow, come, and take this shadow up,</LINE>
<LINE>For &#8217;tis thy rival. O thou senseless form,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou shalt be worshipp&#8217;d, kiss&#8217;d, lov&#8217;d, and ador&#8217;d;</LINE>
<LINE>And were there sense in his idolatry,</LINE>
<LINE>My substance should be statue in thy stead.</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll use thee kindly for thy mistress&#8217; sake</LINE>
<LINE>That us&#8217;d me so; or else, by Jove I vow,</LINE>
<LINE>I should have scratch&#8217;d out your unseeing eyes,</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, sir, I find her milder than she was,</LINE>
<LINE>And yet she takes exceptions at your person.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What? That my leg is too long?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, that it is too little.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll wear a boot, to make it somewhat rounder.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JUL.</SPEAKER>
<STAGEDIR>Aside.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>But love will not be spurr&#8217;d to what it loathes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What says she to my face?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She says it is a fair one.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay then the wanton lies; my face is black.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But pearls are fair; and the old saying is,</LINE>
<LINE>Black men are pearls in beauteous ladies&#8217; eyes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JUL.</SPEAKER>
<STAGEDIR>Aside.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis true, such pearls as put out ladies&#8217; eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>For I had rather wink than look on them.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How likes she my discourse?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ill, when you talk of war.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But well, when I discourse of love and peace.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JUL.</SPEAKER>
<STAGEDIR>Aside.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>But better indeed, when you hold your peace.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What says she to my valor?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, sir, she makes no doubt of that.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JUL.</SPEAKER>
<STAGEDIR>Aside.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>She needs not, when she knows it cowardice.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What says she to my birth?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That you are well deriv&#8217;d.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JUL.</SPEAKER>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Considers she my possessions?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O ay; and pities them.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Wherefore?</LINE>

<SPEAKER>JUL.</SPEAKER>

<SPEAKER>DUKE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How now, Sir Proteus? How now, Thurio?</LINE>
<LINE>Which of you saw Eglamour of late?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not I.</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="8">Neither.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why then</LINE>
<LINE>She&#8217;s fled unto that peasant Valentine;</LINE>
<LINE>And Eglamour is in her company.</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis true; for Friar Laurence met them both,</LINE>
<LINE>As he in penance wander&#8217;d through the forest;</LINE>
<LINE>Him he knew well, and guess&#8217;d that it was she,</LINE>
<LINE>But being mask&#8217;d, he was not sure of it;</LINE>
<LINE>Besides, she did intend confession</LINE>
<LINE>At Patrick&#8217;s cell this even, and there she was not.</LINE>
<LINE>These likelihoods confirm her flight from hence:</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore I pray you stand not to discourse,</LINE>
<LINE>But mount you presently and meet with me</LINE>
<LINE>Upon the rising of the mountain foot</LINE>
<LINE>That leads toward Mantua, whither they are fled.</LINE>
<LINE>Dispatch, sweet gentlemen, and follow me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, this it is to be a peevish girl,</LINE>
<LINE>That flies her fortune when it follows her.</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll after, more to be reveng&#8217;d on Eglamour</LINE>
<LINE>Than for the love of reckless Silvia.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And I will follow, more for Silvia&#8217;s love</LINE>
<LINE>Than hate of Eglamour that goes with her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JUL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And I will follow, more to cross that love</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How use doth breed a habit in a man!</LINE>
<LINE>This shadowy desert, unfrequented woods,</LINE>
<LINE>I better brook than flourishing peopled towns:</LINE>
<LINE>Here can I sit alone, unseen of any,</LINE>
<LINE>And to the nightingale&#8217;s complaining notes</LINE>
<LINE>Tune my distresses and record my woes.</LINE>
<LINE>O thou that dost inhabit in my breast,</LINE>
<LINE>Leave not the mansion so long tenantless,</LINE>
<LINE>Lest growing ruinous, the building fall</LINE>
<LINE>And leave no memory of what it was!</LINE>
<LINE>Repair me with thy presence, Silvia;</LINE>
<LINE>Thou gentle nymph, cherish thy forlorn swain.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Shouts within.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>What hallowing and what stir is this today?</LINE>
<LINE>These are my mates, that make their wills their law,</LINE>
<LINE>Have some unhappy passenger in chase.</LINE>

<LINE>To keep them from uncivil outrages.</LINE>
<LINE>Withdraw thee, Valentine: who&#8217;s this comes here?</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Madam, this service I have done for you</LINE>
<LINE>(Though you respect not aught your servant doth)</LINE>
<LINE>To hazard life, and rescue you from him</LINE>
<LINE>That would have forc&#8217;d your honor and your love.</LINE>
<LINE>Vouchsafe me, for my meed, but one fair look:</LINE>
<LINE>A smaller boon than this I cannot beg,</LINE>
<LINE>And less than this, I am sure you cannot give.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VAL.</SPEAKER>
<STAGEDIR>Aside.</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>And me, when he approacheth to your presence.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Had I been seized by a hungry lion,</LINE>
<LINE>I would have been a breakfast to the beast</LINE>
<LINE>Rather than have false Proteus rescue me.</LINE>
<LINE>O heaven be judge how I love Valentine,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose life&#8217;s as tender to me as my soul!</LINE>
<LINE>And full as much (for more there cannot be)</LINE>
<LINE>I do detest false perjur&#8217;d Proteus.</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore be gone, solicit me no more.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What dangerous action, stood it next to death,</LINE>
<LINE>Would I not undergo for one calm look?</LINE>
<LINE>O, &#8217;tis the curse in love, and still approv&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>When women cannot love where they&#8217;re belov&#8217;d!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>When Proteus cannot love where he&#8217;s belov&#8217;d!</LINE>
<LINE>Read over Julia&#8217;s heart (thy first best love),</LINE>
<LINE>For whose dear sake thou didst then rend thy faith</LINE>
<LINE>Into a thousand oaths; and all those oaths</LINE>
<LINE>Descended into perjury, to love me.</LINE>
<LINE>Thou hast no faith left now, unless thou&#8217;dst two,</LINE>
<LINE>And that&#8217;s far worse than none: better have none</LINE>

<LINE offset="6">Valentine!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou common friend, that&#8217;s without faith or love,</LINE>
<LINE>For such is a friend now! Treacherous man,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou hast beguil&#8217;d my hopes! Nought but mine eye</LINE>
<LINE>Could have persuaded me; now I dare not say</LINE>
<LINE>I have one friend alive; thou wouldst disprove me.</LINE>
<LINE>Who should be trusted, when one&#8217;s right hand</LINE>
<LINE>Is perjured to the bosom? Proteus,</LINE>
<LINE>I am sorry I must never trust thee more,</LINE>
<LINE>But count the world a stranger for thy sake.</LINE>
<LINE>The private wound is deepest: O time most accurst!</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Mongst all foes that a friend should be the worst!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My shame and guilt confounds me.</LINE>
<LINE>Forgive me, Valentine; if hearty sorrow</LINE>
<LINE>Be a sufficient ransom for offense,</LINE>
<LINE>I tender&#8217;t here: I do as truly suffer</LINE>
<LINE>As e&#8217;er I did commit.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Then I am paid;</LINE>

<LINE>By penitence th&#8217; Eternal&#8217;s wrath&#8217;s appeas&#8217;d:</LINE>

<LINE>Be thou asham&#8217;d that I have took upon me</LINE>
<LINE>Such an immodest raiment&#8212;if shame live</LINE>
<LINE>In a disguise of love!</LINE>
<LINE>It is the lesser blot, modesty finds,</LINE>
<LINE>Women to change their shapes than men their minds.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Than men their minds? &#8217;Tis true. O heaven, were man</LINE>

<LINE>Fills him with faults; makes him run through all th&#8217; sins:</LINE>
<LINE>Inconstancy falls off ere it begins.</LINE>
<LINE>What is in Silvia&#8217;s face, but I may spy</LINE>
<LINE>More fresh in Julia&#8217;s with a constant eye?</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The more degenerate and base art thou</LINE>

<LINE>I do applaud thy spirit, Valentine,</LINE>
