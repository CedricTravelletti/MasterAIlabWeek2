<persona gender="female">
<persname short="LADY F.">Lady Faulconbridge</persname>
<persdescription>Lady Faulconbridge is a lady of Northamptonshire and widow of Sir Robert Faulconbridge. Some years ago, when her husband was off on an embassy, she had a brief fling with the then-king, Richard Coeur-de-Lion (the Lionhearted), which resulted in the birth of her son Philip; her second son, Robert, was born to her actual husband. When she hears that her two sons have gone to court to work out who should be the heir, she rushes after to defend her honor. She insists that Philip is legitimate until she hears that he has denied his name himself and been knighted, upon which she immediately admits that he is indeed a bastard, though she insists that it took King Richard some time to seduce her.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="female">
<persname short="BLANCH.">Blanch of Spain</persname>
<persdescription>Blanch of Spain is King John&#8217;s niece and daughter to the King of Castile. She is an obedient girl who is willing to be used as a political pawn until war breaks out again and she finds her loyalties torn. Somewhat na&#239;ve, she is shocked to discover that she cannot restore the peace her marriage was meant to seal by pleading. Once married, however, she follows custom and accompanies her husband, even though he is on his way to wage war on her uncle. She shows some evidence of a mocking tongue, though she may simply be a wide-eyed, admiring girl.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="female">
<persname short="CONST.">Constance</persname>
<persdescription>Constance is the widow of King John&#8217;s elder brother Geoffrey, and Prince Arthur&#8217;s mother. Convinced of her son&#8217;s right to the throne (and of the danger to his life if John remains in power), she calls on Philip of France to help her have Arthur declared King of England. A high-spirited woman, she does not understand the concept of diplomacy, flying into rages at the least provocation. She is an excellent ranter who knows how to use language to her advantage, but she is careless, insulting everybody who does her the faintest slight. She does not like many people, but is still shocked when the men who had sworn to uphold her casually break their oaths. An expert mocker, she hates her mother-in-law Elinor. She nevertheless hopes that things can be resolved without bloodshed. Possessed of a melodramatic character, Constance is sometimes thought by others to be playing a role; but however wildly expressed, her emotions are genuine and deeply felt. She adores her son, and is (rightly) terrified of what may happen to him.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="female">
<persname short="EL.">Queen Elinor</persname>
<persdescription>Queen Elinor, widow of Henry II, is King John&#8217;s mother. History&#8217;s Eleanor of Aquitaine, she is an old and decrepit woman still in full possession of her senses. She is much stronger-willed (and more intelligent) than her son; she is also still quite capable of flirting with her newly-discovered grandson, the Bastard. She is John&#8217;s chief counselor, and fully aware that his claim to the throne is less than strong. Adept at diplomacy, she believes it is a better solution than war, and quickly sees the benefit of Hubert&#8217;s suggestion that Blanch and Lewis marry. Her reputation is not good, possibly with good reason: she may have forged a will to allow John to succeed to the throne, and may also distract Arthur specifically so that John can entice Hubert into murdering the boy. Living mostly in France, she is John&#8217;s chief information-gatherer about the preparations for war, and her death leaves him ill-informed about the coming French invasion.</persdescription>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="CHAT.">Chatillion</persname>
<persdescription>Chatillion is a nobleman of France, set as an ambassador by King Philip to John, to formally challenge the latter&#8217;s right to the throne. He is overtaken on the trip to France by John&#8217;s forces, and arrives back at Philip&#8217;s side only just in time to warn the latter that the English army is at hand.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="MEL.">Melune</persname>
<persdescription>Melune is a French Count, a friend of Hubert de Burgh&#8217;s, and one of Lewis&#8217;s chief counselors during the Dolphin&#8217;s war against England. He is among the French lords who swear to kill the rebellious English lords once the war is won. When he is mortally wounded in battle, however, his conscience awakens, and he remembers that along with having English friends, his grandfather was English; he therefore reveals the plot to the rebels.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="PAND.">Cardinal Pandulph</persname>
<persdescription>Pandulph is the Cardinal of Milan and a legate of the Pope, sent to enforce obedience from John. Full of his own authority, he is a sly, hair-splitting politician, and a very persuasive man. In his quest to bring John to heel, he excommunicates the English King and threatens the French monarch with the same sentence if he does not immediately make war on John. He has little sympathy for Constance, whose claims for her son he finds rather a distraction from the main point of John&#8217;s disobedience. He tempts Lewis into invading England, and uses this invasion as an argument that persuades John to submit himself to the Pope. Having no more need of the French army, he attempts to call off the attack, but a little too late. When Lewis realizes that his invasion has failed, he uses Pandulph as a go-between to negotiate terms with the English.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="AUST.">Lymoges, Duke of Austria</persname>
<persdescription>The Duke of Austria, also called Lymoges, was responsible for the death of the previous King of England, Richard Coeur-de-lion (the Lionhearted). He is a foolish braggart who goes around wearing a lion-skin in memory of that fact, betrays his oaths easily, and threatens while rarely acting on his threats. Taunted by the Bastard, he finds himself beheaded by the latter in combat.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="LEW.">Lewis, the Dauphin</persname>
<persdescription>Lewis is the Dauphin (heir to the throne) of France, and King Philip&#8217;s son. Like his father a good speaker of empty phrases, he is quite willing to marry Blanch for political reasons and speak the part of the lovelorn swain, but he is far more hot-blooded than Philip and likes a good opportunity for war. He is able to be swayed by Pandulph into making war in his own right for the throne of England, and once he has been convinced to do so refuses to step back, not intending to merely be Pandulph&#8217;s tool. He is a young man, and rather cold; while he accepts the services of the rebellious English noblemen, he fully intends to execute them once they have served their purpose. He is also proud and foolish, not realizing the extent to which his success in England is tied to Pandulph. When the English lords hear of his plans for their deaths and return to John, he does finally accept that he will not win, and goes back home.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="K. PHI.">Philip, King of France</persname>
<persdescription>Philip, King of France, is an able politician who uses Constance&#8217;s claims on behalf of Arthur as an excellent excuse to make war on England and try to wrest control of England&#8217;s lands in France. When he sees an opportunity to acquire those lands without wasting any blood, he is quick to seize it. He is not overly troubled by his oaths, and is quick to join with whoever suits his purposes best. However, he is enough of a loyal son of the Church that when John is excommunicated he is convinced by Pandulph to abandon his recent agreement with the English king &#8212; though it may be that seeing John in a bad position, he simply realizes that this would be a good time to fight him. He is a good speaker of empty phrases, and though he feels some pity for Constance, he in general dismisses her and thinks that she overplays her part. He gives over the war against England to his son Lewis.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="PETER.">Peter of Pomfret</persname>
<persdescription>Peter of Pomfret is a poor man who has foreknowledge of the future, and tells everyone he meets that John will give up his crown before Ascension Day. This leads to his arrest and imprisonment.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="GUR.">James Gurney</persname>
<persdescription>James Gurney is a servant of the Faulconbridges, who accompanies Lady Faulconbridge when she rushes to court to defend her honor.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="BAST.">Philip, the Bastard</persname>
<persdescription>The Bastard, first known as Philip Faulconbridge, is knighted and renamed as Sir Richard Plantagenet by King John when the latter comes to agree that the young man is his brother Richard the Lionhearted&#8217;s bastard son. An excellent fighter, hugely energetic, the Bastard is glib and extraordinarily cheeky, to the extent that John sometimes has to rein him in. Utterly guileless, he has no qualms about giving up a guaranteed income for the sake of a new name and the opportunities afforded by serving the King. He is a charmer, quickly getting his grandmother Elinor&#8217;s approval and becoming one of John&#8217;s closest advisers. He is loyal to his uncle, and thinks nothing of being sent to ransack monasteries to find money for the wars. Impatient with the dithering of the citizens of Angers, he suggests that the town be destroyed before anyone decides who owns it, while seeing the advantage that the enemy might end up destroying itself at the same time. He is a fair man, willing to fight Salisbury to allow Hubert have a chance to explain himself, even though he shares Salisbury&#8217;s opinion of the man. John gives him complete command of the English forces to fight off the French after Pandulph fails to arrange a peace. The Bastard grows up over the course of the play: starting as merely high-spirited, his experience with politics soon makes him extremely cynical about the world, and he resolves to make the most of it; but he slowly comes to realize that there are things more important, and he leads the English noblemen in their resolve to keep their land free from French invasion.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="ROB.">Robert Faulconbridge</persname>
<persdescription>Robert Faulconbridge, son of Sir Robert Faulconbridge, is a young gentleman of Northamptonshire who is convinced that his elder brother Philip is in fact the bastard son of the former King. Since if this were proved, he would become his father&#8217;s heir, to the tune of 500 pounds a year, he decides to openly challenge the inheritance, despite what this does to his mother&#8217;s reputation. He is thin, with spindly legs; he is also earnest and much duller than his brother like most people.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="HUB.">Hubert de Burgh</persname>
<persdescription>Hubert de Burgh is a leading citizen of Angers, a town in France belonging to England. He refuses to open the gates of the town to either John or Philip until they have settled between them who ought to be King of England, hoping that this will avoid having his town sacked by either party. When at the Bastard&#8217;s suggestion the two instead team up to destroy Angers first, Hubert quickly comes up with another plan, the marriage of Blanch and Lewis. With John therefore confirmed as King of England, Hubert rallies to his side and becomes a trusted ally &#8212; enough that John entrusts him with Arthur&#8217;s death. Unfortunately for John, Hubert turns out to be a soft-hearted fellow, who becomes great friends with Arthur and in the end cannot bring himself to blind the boy. He pretends to John that he has gone through with the execution, but when he finds John casting all the blame on him, he first points out that he received orders, and then admits that Arthur is alive. He remains loyal to John despite everything, and when the latter is poisoned rushes to find the Bastard. Hubert attempts to do what is right, but is often confused as to what that might be. He looks like an evil man, and this prompts others to think the worst of him.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="BIG.">Lord Bigot</persname>
<persdescription>Lord Bigot is one of John&#8217;s noblemen. He joins Salisbury and Pembroke in their search for Arthur&#8217;s body. Arthur&#8217;s death convinces him to join the others in their betrayal of John. He stands upon his rank and uses it as an insult against Hubert, as well as calling the Bastard by his original name, not acknowledging his royal blood.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="SAL.">Earl of Salisbury</persname>
<persdescription>Earl of Salisbury is one of King John&#8217;s noblemen. He is sent to give the news of the peace between France and England to Constance, and is uncomfortable in the duty. He dislikes too much pomp and is appalled at John&#8217;s decision to be crowned a second time, though he accepts that the King&#8217;s orders must be obeyed. An upright and honorable man, he refuses to follow John any longer when he comes to believe that the King has had Arthur murdered. He vows to revenge Arthur&#8217;s death on finding the boy&#8217;s body, refusing to have any trust in Hubert&#8217;s protestations of innocence. He is the first of the rebellious nobles to make contact with the army of France, and leads them in their desertion to Lewis&#8217;s side. He is torn by his rebellion, however. Warned by Melun of Lewis&#8217;s treachery, he leads the rebellious nobles in returning to the King of England, and is present at John&#8217;s death. He is insulting when roused to anger, refusing to give the Bastard his new name of Plantagenet and instead referring to him as Faulconbridge.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="ESSEX.">Earl of Essex</persname>
<persdescription>The Earl of Essex is one of John&#8217;s noblemen. He is the first to hear of the Faulconbridge dispute, and asks that John judge it.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="PEM.">Earl of Pembroke</persname>
<persdescription>Earl of Pembroke is one of King John&#8217;s noblemen. He lets his disapproval of John&#8217;s second coronation be known, but does not overly object to it, as he had been chosen to be the noblemen&#8217;s spokesman for requesting that Arthur be put at liberty. He knows in advance that John has given orders for Arthur&#8217;s death, and believes in Hubert&#8217;s guilt. He is capable of a sardonic jab at John&#8217;s crocodile tears over the boy. Horrified by Arthur&#8217;s death, he joins Salisbury in rebelling and going over to the French side, where he is worries and bears in mind that a French defeat will mean their lives. He repents on hearing that a French victory will mean their lives as well, and returns with the others to John&#8217;s side, where he attends on the King as he lies dying.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="ARTH.">Arthur</persname>
<persdescription>Arthur, Duke of Britain, is John&#8217;s nephew, the son of his dead older brother Geoffrey. As such, by the laws of primogeniture he has a better right to the throne than John has. Quite young, his rights are pushed forwards far more by his mother than by himself; though he plays his role, he is at best a pawn, pushed around as need be and used as an excuse by Philip. Captured by John, he is given into the keeping of Hubert, to whom he grows very attached. He is a kind-natured boy who feels keenly that all that happens to him and because of him is not his fault. He is for good reason scared of his uncle, though he still finds it hard to believe that John orders his eyes to be put out. He succeeds in pleading for his eyesight and life with Hubert, but he is still afraid and plans to escape. Disguised as a ship-boy, he attempts to escape his prison by jumping from the castle walls, but this is not successful, as he merely ends up dead.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="P. HEN.">Prince Henry</persname>
<persdescription>Prince Henry is King John&#8217;s son and heir. He is an obedient child, insistent that his dead father&#8217;s wishes be carried out, and loves his father deeply. He hopes that the poisoned King will heal, but does not truly expect that he will. He is not the jolliest of princes, but he is honorable, and successfully begs John for the pardon of the rebellious lords when they return to the fold.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="K. JOHN.">King John</persname>
<persdescription>King John is the youngest of Elinor&#8217;s three sons and the last one living; he takes the throne despite the fact that the second of the three brothers left an heir. Sly, slippery, and deeply insecure, John is keenly aware of how uncertain his claim to the throne is. He depends a great deal on his mother, following her advice on everything. Though John acts the part of a King well, there is a distinct weakness to him; he relies on others to do things for him, be it Elinor, the Bastard, or Hubert. He refuses to accept the authority of the Pope until he can no longer afford not to, and pillages the monasteries and abbeys of England to pay for his wars. When things go wrong, he tries to plead that he is not at fault; he does not directly order Arthur&#8217;s death, but speaks highly suggestively to Hubert until the latter confirms that he has understood the King&#8217;s wishes. Once he has Hubert&#8217;s agreement, John does however put the order in writing. He loses whatever respect his noblemen had for him when he has himself crowned a second time to reaffirm his title after defeating Arthur&#8217;s supporters; the news of the French invasion and of his mother&#8217;s death disconcert him greatly, and he suddenly finds his position very shaky. He grows depressed after submitting to Pandulph, and gives over the command of his armies to the Bastard. He is poisoned by a monk, and dies after suffering from a high fever. He is a deeply ambiguous figure, as all the other characters are aware.</persdescription>

<scenepersonae>(King John, Queen Elinor, Pembroke, Essex, Salisbury, Chatillion of France, Sheriff, Robert Faulconbridge, Philip the Bastard, Lady Faulconbridge, James Gurney)</scenepersonae>
<scenedescription>The French Ambassador, insultingly referring to John&#8217;s majesty as &#8220;borrowed,&#8221; insists for his master King Philip that John give up his throne to his elder brother Geoffrey&#8217;s son, Arthur, threatening war if he refuses. John angrily refuses and plans for immediate war in France. His mother Queen Elinor reminds him that she predicted that Arthur&#8217;s mother Constance would make trouble, and that some diplomatic talk might have prevented all this, but John argues that possession of the throne will be enough. Elinor admits that John&#8217;s claim to the throne is weak.  John is then called on to settle a dispute between two brothers as to which is the rightful heir to their father&#8217;s land. The younger one charges that the elder, Philip, is a bastard; both Elinor and John admit that he rather resembles the deceased Richard the Lion-Hearted, both in feature and in manner. Elinor offers the Bastard the choice between remaining a mere Faulconbridge and inheriting, or giving up his reputed father&#8217;s lands to the younger brother and becoming a knight at John&#8217;s court. He doesn&#8217;t even think it over, opts to stay, and is knighted by John. Left alone, the Bastard is delighted at his new status. His mother enters in a fury, seeking for the son who has slandered her as an adulteress, but finding how things have turned out, she admits that Richard Lion-Hearted was indeed Philip&#8217;s father.</scenedescription>

<scenelocation>France. Before the town of Angiers.</scenelocation>
<scenepersonae>(Philip, King of France, Lewis the Dauphin, Constance, Arthur, Austria, Chatillion, John, King of England, Bastard, Queen Elinor, Blanch, Pembroke, Hubert, Citizens, Herald of France, English Herald)</scenepersonae>
<scenedescription>The King of France and the Duke of Austria join forces before the town, preparing to attack it on Arthur&#8217;s behalf. Austria is presented to Arthur and his mother Constance. They wait to hear how the embassy to John went before attacking, in case he has given up the throne, but not only has John kept the throne, he has mustered an army so quickly that he arrives before Angiers on the heels of the French ambassador. John and Philip debate John&#8217;s right to the throne, Elinor and Constance trading insults the while. Both sides appeal to the citizens of the town to decide which is the true king, but the citizens refuse to decide, stating that they have decided not to open their gates to either side. The French and English go off to fight, and soon return, both claiming victory. The citizens still refuse to pick a king, and the exasperated Bastard proposes that everyone set their quarrel aside and destroy the city before they get back to fighting each other. Both Kings agree, and the worried citizens quickly propose that John&#8217;s niece Blanch marry Philip&#8217;s son Lewis, so that everyone can be happy. Out of self-interest, the two kings agree, with Philip giving up Arthur&#8217;s cause as part of the deal. The Bastard expostulates on how quickly self-interest makes people forget their oaths, and decides that he might as well do the same himself.</scenedescription>

<scenedescription>Distraught and dejected, Constance laments the newly patched-up peace, and refuses to go see the kings, rather sitting on the ground and sulking. The Kings and their train arrive to talk with her, and she berates Philip of France and the Duke of Austria for oath-breaking. Austria huffs and puffs when she insults him, saying that she&#8217;s lucky to be a woman, but the Bastard, who dislikes him, takes up her insult and dares him to do something about it. John calls the Bastard back to order. At this point Cardinal Pandulph, the Legate of the Pope, arrives, and demands that John allow Stephen Langton to assume his position as Archbishop of Canterbury and cease attacking the Church. John defies the Pope, to Philip&#8217;s horror, and is promptly excommunicated. Constance is delighted. Pandulph orders Philip to renounce his newly-made friendship with John; Philip hesitates, but in the end deserts John. Blanch is horrified, torn between her loyalty to her new husband and her loyalty to her uncle. Both sides prepare for battle.</scenedescription>

<scenedescription>Philip and Lewis feel disgraced at their defeat. The loss of Arthur has made Constance almost lose her wits; she raves and refuses to be comforted, convinced that John will have Arthur killed. Pandulph and Philip accuse her of overplaying her part. Pandulph assures Lewis that Arthur is done for, and that this, coupled with the sacking of the monasteries by the Bastard to raise funds, will put England in a state of discontent. Lewis can then put in a claim to the throne of England in the name of his wife Blanch, and trust that the English won&#8217;t fight very hard for a child-murderer. Lewis is won over and agrees to help persuade Philip to send an expedition to England.</scenedescription>

<scenepersonae>(King John, Pembroke, Salisbury, Lords, Hubert, Messenger, Bastard, Peter of Pomfret)</scenepersonae>
<scenedescription>King John has had himself crowned a second time, but his nobility objects to him that this was superfluous. Still, since they acquiesced to this, they now request that he free Arthur. John agrees just as Hubert shows up and claims that the boy is dead. The nobles immediately accuse John of murder and desert him. A messenger arrives with the news that both Elinor and Constance are dead and that a French army under Lewis has landed in Kent. The Bastard returns with his takings from the monasteries and tales of popular unrest, including the prophecies of Peter of Pomfret, who has predicted that the King will yield up his crown. Peter insists he speaks true, and John has him locked up. The Bastard is sent to try and induce the nobles to return to John&#8217;s side. Hubert tells John of the presages and omens seen by the people, and how discontent is spreading with the news of Arthur&#8217;s death. John turns on him and blames him for the murder, but Hubert reminds him it was his own order, and finally tells him that Arthur is still alive. John sends him to tell the nobles this.</scenedescription>

<scenedescription>On Ascension Day, John yields up his crown to Pandulph, who gives it back to him as the Pope&#8217;s man. In exchange Pandulph has agreed to persuade the French to return to France. The Bastard enters with the news of Arthur&#8217;s death. John is shaken. When the Bastard hears of the terms of submission to the Pope, he is angered, and advises John that the French won&#8217;t give up so easily, and that the English should prepare for war.
