<title short="The Phoenix &#38; Turtle">The Phoenix &#38; Turtle</title>
<playwright>William Shakespeare</playwright>


<poembody>
<stanza>
<line>Let the bird of loudest lay,</line>
<line>On the sole Arabian tree,</line>
<line>Herald sad and trumpet be,</line>
<line>To whose sound chaste wings obey.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>But thou shriking harbinger,</line>
<line>Foul precurrer of the fiend,</line>
<line>Augur of the fever&#8217;s end,</line>
<line>To this troop come thou not near.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>From this session interdict</line>
<line>Every fowl of tyrant wing,</line>
<line>Save the eagle, feath&#8217;red king;</line>
<line>Keep the obsequy so strict.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Let the priest in surplice white,</line>
<line>That defunctive music can,</line>
<line>Be the death-divining swan,</line>
<line>Lest the requiem lack his right.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>And thou treble-dated crow,</line>
<line>That thy sable gender mak&#8217;st</line>
<line>With the breath thou giv&#8217;st and tak&#8217;st,</line>
<line>&#8217;Mongst our mourners shalt thou go.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Here the anthem doth commence:</line>
<line>Love and Constancy is dead,</line>
<line>Phoenix and the Turtle fled</line>
<line>In a mutual flame from hence.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>So they loved as love in twain</line>
<line>Had the essence but in one,</line>
<line>Two distincts, division none:</line>
<line>Number there in love was slain.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Hearts remote, yet not asunder;</line>
<line>Distance and no space was seen</line>
<line>&#8217;Twixt this Turtle and his queen:</line>
<line>But in them it were a wonder.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>So between them love did shine,</line>
<line>That the Turtle saw his right</line>
<line>Flaming in the Phoenix&#8217; sight;</line>
<line>Either was the other&#8217;s mine.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Property was thus appalled,</line>
<line>That the self was not the same;</line>
<line>Single nature&#8217;s double name</line>
<line>Neither two nor one was called.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Reason, in itself confounded,</line>
<line>Saw division grow together,</line>
<line>To themselves yet either neither,</line>
<line>Simple were so well compounded:</line>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>That it cried, "How true a twain</line>
<line>Seemeth this concordant one!</line>
<line>Love hath reason, Reason none,</line>
<line>If what parts, can so remain."</line>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Whereupon it made this threne</line>
<line>To the Phoenix and the Dove,</line>
<line>Co-supremes and stars of love,</line>
<line>As chorus to their tragic scene.</line>
</stanza>

<subtitle>Threnos</subtitle>

<stanza>
<line>Beauty, Truth, and Rarity,</line>
<line>Grace in all simplicity,</line>
<line>Here enclos&#8217;d, in cinders lie.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Death is now the Phoenix&#8217; nest,</line>
<line>And the Turtle&#8217;s loyal breast</line>
<line>To eternity doth rest.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Leaving no posterity,</line>
<line>&#8217;Twas not their infirmity,</line>
<line>It was married chastity.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>Truth may seem, but cannot be,</line>
<line>Beauty brag, but &#8217;tis not she,</line>
<line>Truth and Beauty buried be.</line>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<line>To this urn let those repair</line>
<line>That are either true or fair;</line>
<line>For these dead birds sigh a prayer.</line>
</stanza>
