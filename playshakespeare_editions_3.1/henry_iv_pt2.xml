<STAGEDIR>Induction</STAGEDIR>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Rumor, painted full of tongues.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RUM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Open your ears; for which of you will stop</LINE>
<LINE>The vent of hearing when loud Rumor speaks?</LINE>
<LINE>I, from the orient to the drooping west</LINE>
<LINE>(Making the wind my post-horse), still unfold</LINE>
<LINE>The acts commenced on this ball of earth.</LINE>
<LINE>Upon my tongues continual slanders ride,</LINE>
<LINE>The which in every language I pronounce,</LINE>
<LINE>Stuffing the ears of men with false reports.</LINE>
<LINE>I speak of peace, while covert enmity</LINE>
<LINE>Under the smile of safety wounds the world;</LINE>
<LINE>And who but Rumor, who but only I,</LINE>
<LINE>Make fearful musters and prepar&#8217;d defense,</LINE>
<LINE>Whiles the big year, swoll&#8217;n with some other grief,</LINE>
<LINE>Is thought with child by the stern tyrant war,</LINE>
<LINE>And no such matter? Rumor is a pipe</LINE>
<LINE>Blown by surmises, jealousies, conjectures,</LINE>
<LINE>And of so easy and so plain a stop</LINE>
<LINE>That the blunt monster with uncounted heads,</LINE>
<LINE>The still-discordant wav&#8217;ring multitude,</LINE>
<LINE>Can play upon it. But what need I thus</LINE>
<LINE>My well-known body to anatomize</LINE>
<LINE>Among my household? Why is Rumor here?</LINE>
<LINE>I run before King Harry&#8217;s victory,</LINE>
<LINE>Who in a bloody field by Shrewsbury</LINE>
<LINE>Hath beaten down young Hotspur and his troops,</LINE>
<LINE>Quenching the flame of bold rebellion</LINE>
<LINE>Even with the rebels&#8217; blood. But what mean I</LINE>
<LINE>To speak so true at first? My office is</LINE>
<LINE>To noise abroad that Harry Monmouth fell</LINE>
<LINE>Under the wrath of noble Hotspur&#8217;s sword,</LINE>
<LINE>And that the King before the Douglas&#8217; rage</LINE>
<LINE>Stoop&#8217;d his anointed head as low as death.</LINE>
<LINE>This have I rumor&#8217;d through the peasant towns</LINE>
<LINE>Between that royal field of Shrewsbury</LINE>
<LINE>And this worm-eaten hold of ragged stone,</LINE>
<LINE>Where Hotspur&#8217;s father, old Northumberland,</LINE>
<LINE>Lies crafty-sick. The posts come tiring on,</LINE>
<LINE>And not a man of them brings other news</LINE>
<LINE>Than they have learnt of me. From Rumor&#8217;s tongues</LINE>
<LINE>They bring smooth comforts false, worse than true wrongs.</LINE>

<SCENELOCATION>Warkworth. Before Northumberland&#8217;s Castle.</SCENELOCATION>
<SCENEPERSONAE>(Lord Bardolph, Porter, Earl Northumberland, Travers, Morton)</SCENEPERSONAE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter the Lord Bardolph at one door.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>L. BARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who keeps the gate here ho?</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Porter.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE offset="6">Where is the Earl?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PORT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What shall I say you are?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>L. BARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Tell thou the Earl</LINE>
<LINE>That the Lord Bardolph doth attend him here.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PORT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>His lordship is walk&#8217;d forth into the orchard.</LINE>
<LINE>Please it your honor knock but at the gate,</LINE>
<LINE>And he himself will answer.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter the Earl Northumberland in a night-cap and supporting himself with a staff.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>L. BARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Here comes the Earl.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit Porter.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NORTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What news, Lord Bardolph? Every minute now</LINE>
<LINE>Should be the father of some stratagem.</LINE>
<LINE>The times are wild, contention, like a horse</LINE>
<LINE>Full of high feeding, madly hath broke loose,</LINE>
<LINE>And bears down all before him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>L. BARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">Noble Earl,</LINE>
<LINE>I bring you certain news from Shrewsbury.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NORTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good, and God will!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>L. BARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">As good as heart can wish:</LINE>
<LINE>The King is almost wounded to the death,</LINE>
<LINE>And in the fortune of my lord your son,</LINE>
<LINE>Prince Harry slain outright, and both the Blunts</LINE>
<LINE>Kill&#8217;d by the hand of Douglas, young Prince John</LINE>
<LINE>And Westmorland and Stafford fled the field,</LINE>
<LINE>And Harry Monmouth&#8217;s brawn, the hulk Sir John,</LINE>
<LINE>Is prisoner to your son. O, such a day!</LINE>
<LINE>So fought, so followed, and so fairly won,</LINE>
<LINE>Came not till now to dignify the times,</LINE>
<LINE>Since Caesar&#8217;s fortunes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NORTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">How is this deriv&#8217;d?</LINE>
<LINE>Saw you the field? Came you from Shrewsbury?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>L. BARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I spake with one, my lord, that came from thence,</LINE>
<LINE>A gentleman well bred and of good name,</LINE>
<LINE>That freely rend&#8217;red me these news for true.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NORTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here comes my servant Travers, who I sent</LINE>
<LINE>On Tuesday last to listen after news.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Travers.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>L. BARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, I overrode him on the way,</LINE>
<LINE>And he is furnish&#8217;d with no certainties</LINE>
<LINE>More than he haply may retail from me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NORTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, Travers, what good tidings comes with you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRA.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, Sir John Umfrevile turn&#8217;d me back</LINE>
<LINE>With joyful tidings, and being better hors&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Outrode me. After him came spurring hard</LINE>
<LINE>A gentleman, almost forespent with speed,</LINE>
<LINE>That stopp&#8217;d by me to breathe his bloodied horse.</LINE>
<LINE>He ask&#8217;d the way to Chester, and of him</LINE>
<LINE>I did demand what news from Shrewsbury.</LINE>
<LINE>He told me that rebellion had bad luck,</LINE>
<LINE>And that young Harry Percy&#8217;s spur was cold.</LINE>
<LINE>With that he gave his able horse the head,</LINE>
<LINE>And bending forward strook his armed heels</LINE>
<LINE>Against the panting sides of his poor jade</LINE>
<LINE>Up to the rowel-head, and starting so</LINE>
<LINE>He seem&#8217;d in running to devour the way,</LINE>
<LINE>Staying no longer question.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NORTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">Ha? Again.</LINE>
<LINE>Said he young Harry Percy&#8217;s spur was cold?</LINE>
<LINE>Of Hotspur, Coldspur? That rebellion</LINE>
<LINE>Had met ill luck?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>L. BARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">My lord, I&#8217;ll tell you what:</LINE>
<LINE>If my young lord your son have not the day,</LINE>
<LINE>Upon mine honor, for a silken point</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll give my barony. Never talk of it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NORTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why should that gentleman that rode by Travers</LINE>
<LINE>Give then such instances of loss?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>L. BARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">Who, he?</LINE>
<LINE>He was some hilding fellow that had stol&#8217;n</LINE>
<LINE>The horse he rode on, and, upon my life,</LINE>
<LINE>Spoke at a venter. Look, here comes more news.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Morton.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NORTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yea, this man&#8217;s brow, like to a title-leaf,</LINE>
<LINE>Foretells the nature of a tragic volume.</LINE>
<LINE>So looks the strond whereon the imperious flood</LINE>
<LINE>Hath left a witness&#8217;d usurpation.</LINE>
<LINE>Say, Morton, didst thou come from Shrewsbury?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I ran from Shrewsbury, my noble lord,</LINE>
<LINE>Where hateful death put on his ugliest mask</LINE>
<LINE>To fright our party.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NORTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">How doth my son and brother?</LINE>
<LINE>Thou tremblest, and the whiteness in thy cheek</LINE>
<LINE>Is apter than thy tongue to tell thy arrand.</LINE>
<LINE>Even such a man, so faint, so spiritless,</LINE>
<LINE>So dull, so dead in look, so woe-begone,</LINE>
<LINE>Drew Priam&#8217;s curtain in the dead of night,</LINE>
<LINE>And would have told him half his Troy was burnt;</LINE>
<LINE>But Priam found the fire ere he his tongue,</LINE>
<LINE>And I my Percy&#8217;s death ere thou report&#8217;st it.</LINE>
<LINE>This thou wouldst say, &#8220;Your son did thus and thus;</LINE>
<LINE>Your brother thus; so fought the noble Douglas&#8221;&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Stopping my greedy ear with their bold deeds,</LINE>
<LINE>But in the end, to stop my ear indeed,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou hast a sigh to blow away this praise,</LINE>
<LINE>Ending with &#8220;Brother, son, and all are dead.&#8221;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Douglas is living, and your brother yet,</LINE>
<LINE>But for my lord your son&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NORTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Why, he is dead.</LINE>
<LINE>See what a ready tongue suspicion hath!</LINE>
<LINE>He that but fears the thing he would not know</LINE>
<LINE>Hath by instinct knowledge from others&#8217; eyes</LINE>
<LINE>That what he fear&#8217;d is chanced. Yet speak, Morton,</LINE>
<LINE>Tell thou an earl his divination lies,</LINE>
<LINE>And I will take it as a sweet disgrace</LINE>
<LINE>And make thee rich for doing me such wrong.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You are too great to be by me gainsaid,</LINE>
<LINE>Your spirit is too true, your fears too certain.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NORTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yet for all this, say not that Percy&#8217;s dead.</LINE>
<LINE>I see a strange confession in thine eye.</LINE>
<LINE>Thou shak&#8217;st thy head, and hold&#8217;st it fear or sin</LINE>
<LINE>To speak a truth. If he be slain, say so;</LINE>
<LINE>The tongue offends not that reports his death,</LINE>
<LINE>And he doth sin that doth belie the dead,</LINE>
<LINE>Not he which says the dead is not alive.</LINE>
<LINE>Yet the first bringer of unwelcome news</LINE>
<LINE>Hath but a losing office, and his tongue</LINE>
<LINE>Sounds ever after as a sullen bell,</LINE>
<LINE>Rememb&#8217;red tolling a departing friend.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>L. BARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I cannot think, my lord, your son is dead.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am sorry I should force you to believe</LINE>
<LINE>That which I would to God I had not seen,</LINE>
<LINE>But these mine eyes saw him in bloody state,</LINE>
<LINE>Rend&#8217;ring faint quittance, wearied and outbreath&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>To Harry Monmouth, whose swift wrath beat down</LINE>
<LINE>The never-daunted Percy to the earth,</LINE>
<LINE>From whence with life he never more sprung up.</LINE>
<LINE>In few, his death, whose spirit lent a fire</LINE>
<LINE>Even to the dullest peasant in his camp,</LINE>
<LINE>Being bruited once, took fire and heat away</LINE>
<LINE>From the best-temper&#8217;d courage in his troops,</LINE>
<LINE>For from his metal was his party steeled,</LINE>
<LINE>Which once in him abated, all the rest</LINE>
<LINE>Turn&#8217;d on themselves, like dull and heavy lead.</LINE>
<LINE>And as the thing that&#8217;s heavy in itself</LINE>
<LINE>Upon enforcement flies with greatest speed,</LINE>
<LINE>So did our men, heavy in Hotspur&#8217;s loss,</LINE>
<LINE>Lend to this weight such lightness with their fear</LINE>
<LINE>That arrows fled not swifter toward their aim</LINE>
<LINE>Than did our soldiers, aiming at their safety,</LINE>
<LINE>Fly from the field. Then was that noble Worcester</LINE>
<LINE>So soon ta&#8217;en prisoner, and that furious Scot,</LINE>
<LINE>The bloody Douglas, whose well-laboring sword</LINE>
<LINE>Had three times slain th&#8217; appearance of the King,</LINE>
<LINE>Gan vail his stomach and did grace the shame</LINE>
<LINE>Of those that turn&#8217;d their backs, and in his flight,</LINE>
<LINE>Stumbling in fear, was took. The sum of all</LINE>
<LINE>Is that the King hath won, and hath sent out</LINE>
<LINE>A speedy power to encounter you, my lord,</LINE>
<LINE>Under the conduct of young Lancaster</LINE>
<LINE>And Westmorland. This is the news at full.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NORTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For this I shall have time enough to mourn;</LINE>
<LINE>In poison there is physic, and these news,</LINE>
<LINE>Having been well, that would have made me sick,</LINE>
<LINE>Being sick, have (in some measure) made me well.</LINE>
<LINE>And as the wretch whose fever-weak&#8217;ned joints,</LINE>
<LINE>Like strengthless hinges, buckle under life,</LINE>
<LINE>Impatient of his fit, breaks like a fire</LINE>
<LINE>Out of his keeper&#8217;s arms, even so my limbs,</LINE>
<LINE>Weak&#8217;ned with grief, being now enrag&#8217;d with grief,</LINE>
<LINE>Are thrice themselves. Hence therefore, thou nice crutch!</LINE>
<LINE>A scaly gauntlet now with joints of steel</LINE>
<LINE>Must glove this hand; and hence, thou sickly coif!</LINE>
<LINE>That art a guard too wanton for the head</LINE>
<LINE>Which princes, flesh&#8217;d with conquest, aim to hit.</LINE>
<LINE>Now bind my brows with iron, and approach</LINE>
<LINE>The ragged&#8217;st hour that time and spite dare bring</LINE>
<LINE>To frown upon th&#8217; enrag&#8217;d Northumberland!</LINE>
<LINE>Let heaven kiss earth! Now let not Nature&#8217;s hand</LINE>
<LINE>Keep the wild flood confin&#8217;d! Let order die!</LINE>
<LINE>And let this world no longer be a stage</LINE>
<LINE>To feed contention in a ling&#8217;ring act;</LINE>
<LINE>But let one spirit of the first-born Cain</LINE>
<LINE>Reign in all bosoms, that each heart being set</LINE>
<LINE>On bloody courses, the rude scene may end,</LINE>
<LINE>And darkness be the burier of the dead!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>L. BARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This strained passion doth you wrong, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sweet Earl, divorce not wisdom from your honor,</LINE>
<LINE>The lives of all your loving complices</LINE>
<LINE>Lean on your health, the which, if you give o&#8217;er</LINE>
<LINE>To stormy passion, must perforce decay.</LINE>
<LINE>You cast th&#8217; event of war, my noble lord,</LINE>
<LINE>And summ&#8217;d the accompt of chance before you said,</LINE>
<LINE>&#8220;Let us make head.&#8221; It was your presurmise</LINE>
<LINE>That in the dole of blows your son might drop.</LINE>
<LINE>You knew he walk&#8217;d o&#8217;er perils, on an edge,</LINE>
<LINE>More likely to fall in than to get o&#8217;er;</LINE>
<LINE>You were advis&#8217;d his flesh was capable</LINE>
<LINE>Of wounds and scars; and that his forward spirit</LINE>
<LINE>Would lift him where most trade of danger rang&#8217;d;</LINE>
<LINE>Yet did you say, &#8220;Go forth!&#8221; and none of this</LINE>
<LINE>(Though strongly apprehended) could restrain</LINE>
<LINE>The stiff-borne action. What hath then befall&#8217;n?</LINE>
<LINE>Or what doth this bold enterprise bring forth</LINE>
<LINE>More than that being which was like to be?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>L. BARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We all that are engaged to this loss</LINE>
<LINE>Knew that we ventured on such dangerous seas</LINE>
<LINE>That if we wrought out life &#8217;twas ten to one,</LINE>
<LINE>And yet we ventur&#8217;d for the gain propos&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Chok&#8217;d the respect of likely peril fear&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>And since we are o&#8217;erset, venture again.</LINE>
<LINE>Come, we will all put forth, body and goods.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis more than time, and, my most noble lord,</LINE>
<LINE>I hear for certain and dare speak the truth,</LINE>
<LINE>The gentle Archbishop of York is up</LINE>
<LINE>With well-appointed pow&#8217;rs. He is a man</LINE>
<LINE>Who with a double surety binds his followers.</LINE>
<LINE>My lord your son had only but the corpse&#8217;,</LINE>
<LINE>But shadows and the shows of men, to fight;</LINE>
<LINE>For that same word, rebellion, did divide</LINE>
<LINE>The action of their bodies from their souls,</LINE>
<LINE>And they did fight with queasiness, constrain&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>As men drink potions, that their weapons only</LINE>
<LINE>Seem&#8217;d on our side; but for their spirits and souls,</LINE>
<LINE>This word, rebellion, it had froze them up,</LINE>
<LINE>As fish are in a pond. But now the Bishop</LINE>
<LINE>Turns insurrection to religion.</LINE>
<LINE>Suppos&#8217;d sincere and holy in his thoughts,</LINE>
<LINE>He&#8217;s follow&#8217;d both with body and with mind;</LINE>
<LINE>And doth enlarge his rising with the blood</LINE>
<LINE>Of fair King Richard, scrap&#8217;d from Pomfret stones;</LINE>
<LINE>Derives from heaven his quarrel and his cause;</LINE>
<LINE>Tells them he doth bestride a bleeding land,</LINE>
<LINE>Gasping for life under great Bullingbrook,</LINE>
<LINE>And more and less do flock to follow him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NORTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I knew of this before, but to speak truth,</LINE>
<LINE>This present grief had wip&#8217;d it from my mind.</LINE>
<LINE>Go in with me, and counsel every man</LINE>
<LINE>The aptest way for safety and revenge.</LINE>
<LINE>Get posts and letters, and make friends with speed&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Never so few, and never yet more need.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Sir John Falstaff alone, with his Page, following behind, bearing his sword and buckler.</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>Sirrah, you giant, what says the doctor to my water?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAGE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He said, sir, the water itself was a good healthy water, but for the party that ow&#8217;d it, he might have more diseases than he knew for.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Men of all sorts take a pride to gird at me. The brain of this foolish-compounded clay, man, is not able to invent any thing that intends to laughter more than I invent or is invented on me: I am not only witty in myself, but the cause that wit is in other men. I do here walk before thee like a sow that hath overwhelm&#8217;d all her litter but one. If the Prince put thee into my service for any other reason than to set me off, why then I have no judgment. Thou whoreson mandrake, thou art fitter to be worn in my cap than to wait at my heels. I was never mann&#8217;d with an agot till now, but I will inset you neither in gold nor silver, but in vile apparel, and send you back again to your master for a jewel&#8212;the juvenal, the Prince your master, whose chin is not yet fledge. I will sooner have a beard grow in the palm of my hand than he shall get one of his cheek, and yet he will not stick to say his face is a face royal. God may finish it when he will, &#8217;tis not a hair amiss yet. He may keep it still at a face royal, for a barber shall never earn sixpence out of it; and yet he&#8217;ll be crowing as if he had writ man ever since his father was a bachelor. He may keep his own grace, but he&#8217;s almost out of mine, I can assure him. What said Master Dommelton about the satin for my short cloak and my slops?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAGE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He said, sir, you should procure him better assurance than Bardolph. He would not take his bond and yours, he lik&#8217;d not the security.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let him be damn&#8217;d like the glutton! Pray God his tongue be hotter! A whoreson Achitophel! A rascally yea-forsooth knave, to bear a gentleman in hand, and then stand upon security! The whoreson smoothy-pates do now wear nothing but high shoes, and bunches of keys at their girdles, and if a man is through with them in honest taking up, then they must stand upon security. I had as live they would put ratsbane in my mouth as offer to stop it with security. I look&#8217;d &#8217;a should have sent me two and twenty yards of satin (as I am a true knight), and he sends me security! Well, he may sleep in security, for he hath the horn of abundance, and the lightness of his wife shines through it; and yet cannot he see, though he have his own lanthorn to light him. Where&#8217;s Bardolph?</LINE>

<LINE>He&#8217;s gone into Smithfield to buy your worship a horse.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I bought him in Paul&#8217;s, and he&#8217;ll buy me a horse in Smithfield; and I could get me but a wife in the stews, I were mann&#8217;d, hors&#8217;d, and wiv&#8217;d.</LINE>

<LINE>You must speak louder, my master is deaf.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Sir John!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What? A young knave, and begging? Is there not wars? Is there not employment? Doth not the King lack subjects? Do not the rebels need soldiers? Though it be a shame to be on any side but one, it is worse shame to beg than to be on the worst side, were it worse than the name of rebellion can tell how to make it.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>SERV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You mistake me, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, sir, did I say you were an honest man? Setting my knighthood and my soldiership aside, I had lied in my throat if I had said so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SERV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I pray you, sir, then set your knighthood and your soldiership aside, and give me leave to tell you you lie in your throat if you say I am any other than an honest man.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I give thee leave to tell me so? I lay aside that which grows to me? If thou get&#8217;st any leave of me, hang me; if thou tak&#8217;st leave, thou wert better be hang&#8217;d. You hunt counter, hence, avaunt!</LINE>

<SPEAKER>SERV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, my lord would speak with you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CH. JUST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir John Falstaff, a word with you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My good lord! God give your lordship good time of day. I am glad to see your lordship abroad. I heard say your lordship was sick, I hope your lordship goes abroad by advice. Your lordship, though not clean past your youth, have yet some smack of an ague in you, some relish of the saltness of time in you, and I most humbly beseech your lordship to have a reverend care of your health.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CH. JUST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir John, I sent for you before your expedition to Shrewsbury.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And&#8217;t please your lordship, I hear his Majesty is return&#8217;d with some discomfort from Wales.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CH. JUST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I talk not of his Majesty. You would not come when I sent for you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And I hear, moreover, his Highness is fall&#8217;n into this same whoreson apoplexy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CH. JUST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, God mend him! I pray you let me speak with you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This apoplexy, as I take it, is a kind of lethargy, and&#8217;t please your lordship, a kind of sleeping in the blood, a whoreson tingling.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CH. JUST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What tell you me of it? Be it as it is.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It hath it original from much grief, from study, and perturbation of the brain. I have read the cause of his effects in Galen, it is a kind of deafness.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CH. JUST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I think you are fall&#8217;n into the disease, for you hear not what I say to you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Very well, my lord, very well. Rather, and&#8217;t please you, it is the disease of not list&#8217;ning, the malady of not marking, that I am troubled withal.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CH. JUST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To punish you by the heels would amend the attention of your ears, and I care not if I do become your physician.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am as poor as Job, my lord, but not so patient. Your lordship may minister the potion of imprisonment to me in respect of poverty, but how I should be your patient to follow your prescriptions, the wise may make some dram of a scruple, or indeed a scruple itself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CH. JUST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I sent for you, when there were matters against you for your life, to come speak with me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As I was then advis&#8217;d by my learned counsel in the laws of this land-service, I did not come.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CH. JUST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, the truth is, Sir John, you live in great infamy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He that buckles himself in my belt cannot live in less.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CH. JUST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your means are very slender, and your waste is great.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would it were otherwise, I would my means were greater and my waist slenderer.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CH. JUST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You have misled the youthful prince.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The young prince hath misled me. I am the fellow with the great belly, and he my dog.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CH. JUST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, I am loath to gall a new-heal&#8217;d wound. Your day&#8217;s service at Shrewsbury hath a little gilded over your night&#8217;s exploit on Gadshill. You may thank th&#8217; unquiet time for your quiet o&#8217;erposting that action.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CH. JUST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But since all is well, keep it so, wake not a sleeping wolf.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To wake a wolf is as bad as smell a fox.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CH. JUST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, you are as a candle, the better part burnt out.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A wassail candle, my lord, all tallow; if I did say of wax, my growth would approve the truth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CH. JUST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There is not a white hair in your face but should have his effect of gravity.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>His effect of gravy, gravy, gravy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CH. JUST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You follow the young prince up and down, like his ill angel.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not so, my lord. Your ill angel is light, but I hope he that looks upon me will take me without weighing, and yet in some respects I grant I cannot go. I cannot tell. Virtue is of so little regard in these costermongers&#8217; times that true valor is turn&#8217;d berrord; pregnancy is made a tapster, and his quick wit wasted in giving reckonings; all the other gifts appertinent to man, as the malice of this age shapes them, are not worth a gooseberry. You that are old consider not the capacities of us that are young, you do measure the heat of our livers with the bitterness of your galls; and we that are in the vaward of our youth, I must confess, are wags too.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CH. JUST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do you set down your name in the scroll of youth, that are written down old with all the characters of age? Have you not a moist eye, a dry hand, a yellow cheek, a white beard, a decreasing leg, an increasing belly? Is not your voice broken, your wind short, your chin double, your wit single, and every part about you blasted with antiquity? And will you yet call yourself young? Fie, fie, fie, Sir John!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, I was born about three of the clock in the afternoon, with a white head and something a round belly. For my voice, I have lost it with hallowing and singing of anthems. To approve my youth further, I will not. The truth is, I am only old in judgment and understanding; and he that will caper with me for a thousand marks, let him lend me the money, and have at him! For the box of the year that the Prince gave you, he gave it like a rude prince, and you took it like a sensible lord. I have check&#8217;d him for it, and the young lion repents,</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>marry, not in ashes and sackcloth, but in new silk and old sack.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CH. JUST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, God send the Prince a better companion!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>God send the companion a better prince! I cannot rid my hands of him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CH. JUST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, the King hath sever&#8217;d you. I hear you are going with Lord John of Lancaster against the Archbishop and the Earl of Northumberland.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yea, I thank your pretty sweet wit for it. But look you pray, all you that kiss my Lady Peace at home, that our armies join not in a hot day! For, by the Lord, I take but two shirts out with me, and I mean not to sweat extraordinarily. If it be a hot day, and I brandish any thing but a bottle, I would I might never spit white again. There is not a dangerous action can peep out his head but I am thrust upon it. Well, I cannot last ever, but it was alway yet the trick of our English nation, if they have a good thing, to make it too common. If ye will needs say I am an old man, you should give me rest. I would to God my name were not so terrible to the enemy as it is. I were better to be eaten to death with a rust than to be scour&#8217;d to nothing with perpetual motion.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CH. JUST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, be honest, be honest, and God bless your expedition!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Will your lordship lend me a thousand pound to furnish me forth?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CH. JUST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not a penny, not a penny, you are too impatient to bear crosses. Fare you well! Commend me to my cousin Westmorland.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt Chief Justice and Servant.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If I do, fillip me with a three-man beetle. A man can no more separate age and covetousness than &#8217;a can part young limbs and lechery; but the gout galls the one, and the pox pinches the other, and so both the degrees prevent my curses. Boy!</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAGE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Seven groats and two pence.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I can get no remedy against this consumption of the purse; borrowing only lingers and lingers it out, but the disease is incurable. Go bear this letter to my Lord of Lancaster, this to the Prince, this to the Earl of Westmorland, and this to old Mistress Ursula, whom I have weekly sworn to marry since I perceiv&#8217;d the first white hair of my chin. About it, you know where to find me.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit Page.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>A pox of this gout! Or a gout of this pox! For the one or the other plays the rogue with my great toe. &#8217;Tis no matter if I do halt, I have the wars for my color, and my pension shall seem the more reasonable. A good wit will make use of any thing. I will turn diseases to commodity.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARCH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thus have you heard our cause and known our means,</LINE>
<LINE>And, my most noble friends, I pray you all</LINE>
<LINE>Speak plainly your opinions of our hopes.</LINE>
<LINE>And first, Lord Marshal, what say you to it?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MOWB.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I well allow the occasion of our arms,</LINE>
<LINE>But gladly would be better satisfied</LINE>
<LINE>How in our means we should advance ourselves</LINE>
<LINE>To look with forehead bold and big enough</LINE>
<LINE>Upon the power and puissance of the King.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Our present musters grow upon the file</LINE>
<LINE>To five and twenty thousand men of choice,</LINE>
<LINE>And our supplies live largely in the hope</LINE>
<LINE>Of great Northumberland, whose bosom burns</LINE>
<LINE>With an incensed fire of injuries.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>L. BARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The question then, Lord Hastings, standeth thus:</LINE>
<LINE>Whether our present five and twenty thousand</LINE>
<LINE>May hold up head without Northumberland?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>With him, we may.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>L. BARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Yea, marry, there&#8217;s the point!</LINE>
<LINE>But if without him we be thought too feeble,</LINE>
<LINE>My judgment is we should not step too far</LINE>
<LINE>Till we had his assistance by the hand.</LINE>
<LINE>For in a theme so bloody-fac&#8217;d as this,</LINE>
<LINE>Conjecture, expectation, and surmise</LINE>
<LINE>Of aids incertain should not be admitted.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARCH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis very true, Lord Bardolph, for indeed</LINE>
<LINE>It was young Hotspur&#8217;s cause at Shrewsbury.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>L. BARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It was, my lord, who lin&#8217;d himself with hope,</LINE>
<LINE>Eating the air, and promise of supply,</LINE>
<LINE>Flatt&#8217;ring himself in project of a power</LINE>
<LINE>Much smaller than the smallest of his thoughts,</LINE>
<LINE>And so with great imagination,</LINE>
<LINE>Proper to madmen, led his powers to death,</LINE>
<LINE>And winking, leapt into destruction.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But by your leave, it never yet did hurt</LINE>
<LINE>To lay down likelihoods and forms of hope.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>L. BARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, if this present quality of war&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Indeed the instant action, a cause on foot&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Lives so in hope, as in an early spring</LINE>
<LINE>We see th&#8217; appearing buds, which to prove fruit</LINE>
<LINE>Hope gives not so much warrant, as despair</LINE>
<LINE>That frosts will bite them. When we mean to build,</LINE>
<LINE>We first survey the plot, then draw the model,</LINE>
<LINE>And when we see the figure of the house,</LINE>
<LINE>Then must we rate the cost of the erection,</LINE>
<LINE>Which if we find outweighs ability,</LINE>
<LINE>What do we then but draw anew the model</LINE>
<LINE>In fewer offices, or at least desist</LINE>
<LINE>To build at all? Much more, in this great work</LINE>
<LINE>(Which is, almost, to pluck a kingdom down</LINE>
<LINE>And set another up), should we survey</LINE>
<LINE>The plot of situation and the model,</LINE>
<LINE>Consent upon a sure foundation,</LINE>
<LINE>Question surveyors, know our own estate,</LINE>
<LINE>How able such a work to undergo,</LINE>
<LINE>To weigh against his opposite; or else</LINE>
<LINE>We fortify in paper and in figures,</LINE>
<LINE>Using the names of men in stead of men,</LINE>
<LINE>Like one that draws the model of an house</LINE>
<LINE>Beyond his power to build it, who, half thorough,</LINE>
<LINE>Gives o&#8217;er, and leaves his part-created cost</LINE>
<LINE>A naked subject to the weeping clouds</LINE>
<LINE>And waste for churlish winter&#8217;s tyranny.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Grant that our hopes (yet likely of fair birth)</LINE>
<LINE>Should be still-born, and that we now possess&#8217;d</LINE>

<LINE>I think we are so a body strong enough,</LINE>
<LINE>Even as we are, to equal with the King.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To us no more, nay, not so much, Lord Bardolph,</LINE>
<LINE>For his divisions, as the times do brawl,</LINE>
<LINE>Are in three heads: one power against the French,</LINE>
<LINE>And one against Glendower; perforce a third</LINE>
<LINE>Must take up us. So is the unfirm King</LINE>
<LINE>In three divided, and his coffers sound</LINE>
<LINE>With hollow poverty and emptiness.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARCH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That he should draw his several strengths together,</LINE>

<LINE>I am undone by his going, I warrant you, he&#8217;s an infinitive thing upon my score. Good Master Fang, hold him sure. Good Master Snare, let him not scape. &#8217;A comes continuantly to Pie-corner (saving your manhoods) to buy a saddle, and he is indited to dinner to the Lubber&#8217;s Head in Lumbert street, to Master Smooth&#8217;s the silk-man. I pray you, since my exion is ent&#8217;red and my case so openly known to the world, let him be brought in to his answer. A hundred mark is a long one for a poor lone woman to bear, and I have borne, and borne, and borne, and have been fubb&#8217;d off, and fubb&#8217;d off, and fubb&#8217;d off, from this day to that day, that it is a shame to be thought on. There is no honesty in such dealing, unless a woman should be made an ass and a beast, to bear every knave&#8217;s wrong.</LINE>

<LINE>For what sum?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is more than for some, my lord, it is for all I have. He hath eaten me out of house and home, he hath put all my substance into that fat belly of his, but I will have some of it out again, or I will ride thee a&#8217; nights like the mare.</LINE>

<LINE>What is the gross sum that I owe thee?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, if thou wert an honest man, thyself and the money too. Thou didst swear to me upon a parcel-gilt goblet, sitting in my Dauphin chamber, at the round table by a sea-coal fire, upon Wednesday in Wheeson week, when the Prince broke thy head for liking his father to a singing-man of Windsor, thou didst swear to me then, as I was washing thy wound, to marry me and make me my lady thy wife. Canst thou deny it? Did not goodwife Keech, the butcher&#8217;s wife, come in then and call me gossip Quickly? Coming in to borrow a mess of vinegar, telling us she had a good dish of prawns, whereby thou didst desire to eat some, whereby I told thee they were ill for a green wound? And didst thou not, when she was gone down stairs, desire me to be no more so familiarity with such poor people, saying that ere long they should call me madam? And didst thou not kiss me, and bid me fetch thee thirty shillings? I put thee now to thy book-oath. Deny it if thou canst.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, this is a poor mad soul, and she says up and down the town that her eldest son is like you. She hath been in good case, and the truth is, poverty hath distracted her. But for these foolish officers, I beseech you I may have redress against them.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CH. JUST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir John, Sir John, I am well acquainted with your manner of wrenching the true cause the false way. It is not a confident brow, nor the throng of words that come with such more than impudent sauciness from you, can thrust me from a level consideration. You have, as it appears to me, practic&#8217;d upon the easy-yielding spirit of this woman, and made her serve your uses both in purse and in person.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yea, in truth, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CH. JUST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pray thee peace. Pay her the debt you owe her, and unpay the villainy you have done with her. The one you may do with sterling money, and the other with current repentance.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, I will not undergo this sneap without reply. You call honorable boldness impudent sauciness; if a man will make curtsy and say nothing, he is virtuous. No, my lord, my humble duty rememb&#8217;red, I will not be your suitor. I say to you, I do desire deliverance from these officers, being upon hasty employment in the King&#8217;s affairs.</LINE>

<LINE>Glasses, glasses, is the only drinking, and for thy walls, a pretty slight drollery, or the story of the Prodigal, or the German hunting in waterwork, is worth a thousand of these bed-hangers and these fly-bitten tapestries.

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Before God, I am exceeding weary.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POINS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is&#8217;t come to that? I had thought weariness durst not have attach&#8217;d one of so high blood.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Faith, it does me, though it discolors the complexion of my greatness to acknowledge it. Doth it not show vildly in me to desire small beer?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POINS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, a prince should not be so loosely studied as to remember so weak a composition.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Belike then my appetite was not princely got, for, by my troth, I do now remember the poor creature, small beer. But indeed these humble considerations make me out of love with my greatness. What a disgrace is it to me to remember thy name, or to know thy face tomorrow, or to take note how many pair of silk stockings thou hast, viz., these, and those that were thy peach-color&#8217;d once, or to bear the inventory of thy shirts, as one for superfluity, and another for use! But that the tennis-court-keeper knows better than I, for it is a low ebb of linen with thee when thou keepest not racket there; as thou hast not done a great while, because the rest of the low countries have made a shift to eat up thy holland. And God knows whether those that bawl out the ruins of thy linen shall inherit his kingdom: but the midwives say the children are not in the fault, whereupon the world increases, and kinreds are mightily strengthen&#8217;d.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POINS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How ill it follows, after you have labor&#8217;d so hard, you should talk so idlely! Tell me how many good young princes would do so, their fathers being so sick as yours at this time is.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Shall I tell thee one thing, Poins?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POINS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, faith, and let it be an excellent good thing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It shall serve among wits of no higher breeding than thine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POINS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go to, I stand the push of your one thing that you will tell.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, I tell thee it is not meet that I should be sad, now my father is sick, albeit I could tell to thee&#8212;as to one it pleases me, for fault of a better, to call my friend&#8212;I could be sad, and sad indeed too.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POINS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Very hardly, upon such a subject.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By this hand, thou thinkest me as far in the devil&#8217;s book as thou and Falstaff, for obduracy and persistency. Let the end try the man. But I tell thee, my heart bleeds inwardly that my father is so sick, and keeping such vile company as thou art hath in reason taken from me all ostentation of sorrow.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POINS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The reason?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What wouldst thou think of me if I should weep?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POINS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would think thee a most princely hypocrite.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It would be every man&#8217;s thought, and thou art a blessed fellow to think as every man thinks. Never a man&#8217;s thought in the world keeps the road-way better than thine: every man would think me an hypocrite indeed. And what accites your most worshipful thought to think so?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POINS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, because you have been so lewd and so much engraff&#8217;d to Falstaff.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And to thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POINS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By this light, I am well spoke on, I can hear it with mine own ears. The worst that they can say of me is that I am a second brother, and that I am a proper fellow of my hands, and those two things I confess I cannot help. By the mass, here comes Bardolph.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Bardolph and Boy Page.</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>And yours, most noble Bardolph!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POINS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, you virtuous ass, you bashful fool, must you be blushing? Wherefore blush you now? What a maidenly man-at-arms are you become! Is&#8217;t such a matter to get a pottle-pot&#8217;s maidenhead?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAGE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;A calls me e&#8217;en now, my lord, through a red lattice, and I could discern no part of his face from the window. At last I spied his eyes, and methought he had made two holes in the ale-wive&#8217;s petticoat and so peep&#8217;d through.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8220;I commend me to thee, I commend thee, and I leave thee. Be not too familiar with Poins, for he misuses thy favors so much that he swears thou art to marry his sister Nell. Repent at idle times as thou mayst, and so farewell.</LINE>
<LINE>Thine, by yea and no, which is as much as to say, as thou usest him, Jack Falstaff with my familiars, John with my brothers and sisters, and Sir John with all Europe.&#8221;</LINE>

<LINE>O yet for God&#8217;s sake, go not to these wars!</LINE>
<LINE>The time was, father, that you broke your word</LINE>
<LINE>When you were more endear&#8217;d to it than now,</LINE>
<LINE>When your own Percy, when my heart&#8217;s dear Harry,</LINE>
<LINE>Threw many a northward look to see his father</LINE>
<LINE>Bring up his powers; but he did long in vain.</LINE>
<LINE>Who then persuaded you to stay at home?</LINE>
<LINE>There were two honors lost, yours and your son&#8217;s:</LINE>
<LINE>For yours, the God of heaven brighten it!</LINE>
<LINE>For his, it stuck upon him as the sun</LINE>
<LINE>In the grey vault of heaven, and by his light</LINE>
<LINE>Did all the chevalry of England move</LINE>
<LINE>To do brave acts. He was indeed the glass</LINE>
<LINE>Wherein the noble youth did dress themselves:</LINE>
<LINE>He had no legs that practic&#8217;d not his gait;</LINE>
<LINE>And speaking thick (which nature made his blemish)</LINE>
<LINE>Became the accents of the valiant;</LINE>
<LINE>For those that could speak low and tardily</LINE>

<LINE>To seem like him; so that in speech, in gait,</LINE>
<LINE>In diet, in affections of delight,</LINE>
<LINE>In military rules, humors of blood,</LINE>
<LINE>He was the mark and glass, copy and book,</LINE>
<LINE>That fashion&#8217;d others. And him, O wondrous him!</LINE>
<LINE>O miracle of men! Him did you leave,</LINE>
<LINE>Second to none, unseconded by you,</LINE>
<LINE>To look upon the hideous god of war</LINE>
<LINE>In disadvantage, to abide a field</LINE>
<LINE>Where nothing but the sound of Hotspur&#8217;s name</LINE>
<LINE>Did seem defensible: so you left him.</LINE>
<LINE>Never, O never, do his ghost the wrong</LINE>
<LINE>To hold your honor more precise and nice</LINE>
<LINE>With others than with him! Let them alone.</LINE>
<LINE>The Marshal and the Archbishop are strong.</LINE>
<LINE>Had my sweet Harry had but half their numbers,</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A good shallow young fellow. &#8217;A would have made a good pantler, &#8217;a would &#8217;a&#8217; chipp&#8217;d bread well.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DOLL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why does the Prince love him so then?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Because their legs are both of a bigness, and &#8217;a plays at quoits well, and eats conger and fennel, and drinks off candles&#8217; ends for flap-dragons, and rides the wild-mare with the boys, and jumps upon join&#8217;d-stools, and swears with a good grace, and wears his boots very smooth, like unto the sign of the Leg, and breeds no bate with telling of discreet stories; and such other gambol faculties &#8217;a has, that show a weak mind and an able body, for the which the Prince admits him. For the Prince himself is such another, the weight of a hair will turn scales between their avoirdupois.</LINE>

<LINE>No abuse?</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No abuse, Ned, i&#8217; th&#8217; world, honest Ned, none. I disprais&#8217;d him before the wicked, that the wicked turns to the Prince might not fall in love with thee; in which doing, I have done the part of a careful friend and a true subject, and thy father is to give me thanks for it. No abuse, Hal; none, Ned, none; no, faith, boys, none.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>See now whether pure fear and entire cowardice doth not make thee wrong this virtuous gentlewoman to close with us. Is she of the wicked? Is thine hostess here of the wicked? Or is thy boy of the wicked? Or honest Bardolph, whose zeal burns in his nose, of the wicked?</LINE>

<SPEAKER>HOST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, I warrant you.</LINE>

<LINE>Bare-headed, sweating, knocking at the taverns,</LINE>
<LINE>And asking every one for Sir John Falstaff.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By heaven, Poins, I feel me much to blame</LINE>
<LINE>So idly to profane the precious time,</LINE>
<LINE>When tempest of commotion, like the south</LINE>
<LINE>Borne with black vapor, doth begin to melt</LINE>

<LINE>Give me my sword and cloak. Falstaff, good night.</LINE>

<LINE>Nature&#8217;s soft nurse, how have I frighted thee,</LINE>

<LINE>O God, that one might read the book of fate,</LINE>
<LINE>And see the revolution of the times</LINE>
<LINE>Make mountains level, and the continent,</LINE>
<LINE>Weary of solid firmness, melt itself</LINE>
<LINE>Into the sea, and other times to see</LINE>
<LINE>The beachy girdle of the ocean</LINE>
<LINE>Too wide for Neptune&#8217;s hips; how chance&#8217;s mocks</LINE>

<LINE>With divers liquors! O, if this were seen,</LINE>
<LINE>The happiest youth, viewing his progress through,</LINE>
<LINE>What perils past, what crosses to ensue,</LINE>
<LINE>Would shut the book, and sit him down and die.</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis not ten years gone</LINE>
<LINE>Since Richard and Northumberland, great friends,</LINE>
<LINE>Did feast together, and in two year after</LINE>
<LINE>Were they at wars. It is but eight years since</LINE>
<LINE>This Percy was the man nearest my soul,</LINE>
<LINE>Who like a brother toil&#8217;d in my affairs,</LINE>
<LINE>And laid his love and life under my foot,</LINE>
<LINE>Yea, for my sake, even to the eyes of Richard</LINE>
<LINE>Gave him defiance. But which of you was by&#8212;</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>To Warwick.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>You, cousin Nevil, as I may remember&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>When Richard, with his eye brimful of tears,</LINE>
<LINE>Then check&#8217;d and rated by Northumberland,</LINE>
<LINE>Did speak these words, now prov&#8217;d a prophecy?</LINE>

<LINE>(Though then, God knows, I had no such intent,</LINE>

<LINE>&#8220;The time will come, that foul sin, gathering head,</LINE>
<LINE>Shall break into corruption&#8221;: so went on,</LINE>

<LINE>With a near aim, of the main chance of things</LINE>
<LINE>As yet not come to life, who in their seeds</LINE>
<LINE>And weak beginning lie intreasured.</LINE>
<LINE>Such things become the hatch and brood of time,</LINE>
<LINE>And by the necessary form of this</LINE>
<LINE>King Richard might create a perfect guess</LINE>
<LINE>That great Northumberland, then false to him,</LINE>
<LINE>Would of that seed grow to a greater falseness,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, pardon, a soldier is better accommodated than with a wife.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SHAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is well said, in faith, sir, and it is well said indeed too. Better accommodated! It is good, yea indeed is it. Good phrases are surely, and ever were, very commendable. Accommodated! It comes of accommodo, very good, a good phrase.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BARD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pardon, sir, I have heard the word. Phrase call you it? By this day, I know not the phrase, but I will maintain the word with my sword to be a soldier-like word, and a word of exceeding good command, by heaven. Accommodated: that is, when a man is, as they say, accommodated, or when a man is being whereby &#8217;a may be thought to be accommodated&#8212;which is an excellent thing.</LINE>

<LINE>You may, but if he had been a man&#8217;s tailor, he&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; prick&#8217;d you. Wilt thou make as many holes in an enemy&#8217;s battle as thou hast done in a woman&#8217;s petticoat?</LINE>

<LINE>I will do my good will, sir, you can have no more.</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FAL.</SPEAKER>

<LINE>Will you tell me, Master Shallow, how to choose a man? Care I for the limb, the thews, the stature, bulk, and big assemblance of a man? Give me the spirit, Master Shallow. Here&#8217;s Wart, you see what a ragged appearance it is. &#8217;A shall charge you and discharge you with the motion of a pewterer&#8217;s hammer, come off and on swifter than he that gibbets on the brewer&#8217;s bucket. And this same half-fac&#8217;d fellow, Shadow, give me this man. He presents no mark to the enemy, the foeman may with as great aim level at the edge of a penknife. And for a retrait, how swiftly will this Feeble the woman&#8217;s tailor run off! O, give me the spare men, and spare me the great ones. Put me a caliver into Wart&#8217;s hand, Bardolph.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt Bardolph, recruits, etc.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>As I return, I will fetch off these justices. I do see the bottom of Justice Shallow. Lord, Lord, how subject we old men are to this vice of lying! This same starv&#8217;d justice hath done nothing but prate to me of the wildness of his youth, and the feats he hath done about Turnbull Street, and every third word a lie, duer paid to the hearer than the Turk&#8217;s tribute. I do remember him at Clement&#8217;s Inn, like a man made after supper of a cheese-paring. When &#8217;a was naked, he was for all the world like a fork&#8217;d redish, with a head fantastically carv&#8217;d upon it with a knife. &#8217;A was so forlorn, that his dimensions to any thick sight were invisible. &#8217;A was the very genius of famine, yet lecherous as a monkey, and the whores call&#8217;d him mandrake. &#8217;A came ever in the rearward of the fashion, and sung those tunes to the overscutch&#8217;d huswives that he heard the carmen whistle, and sware they were his fancies or his good-nights. And now is this Vice&#8217;s dagger become a squire, and talks as familiarly of John a&#8217; Gaunt as if he had been sworn brother to him, and I&#8217;ll be sworn &#8217;a ne&#8217;er saw him but once in the Tilt-yard, and then he burst his head for crowding among the marshal&#8217;s men. I saw it, and told John a&#8217; Gaunt he beat his own name, for you might have thrust him and all his apparel into an eel-skin. The case of a treble hoboy was a mansion for him, a court, and now has he land and beefs! Well, I&#8217;ll be acquainted with him if I return, and&#8217;t shall go hard but I&#8217;ll make him a philosopher&#8217;s two stones to me. If the young dace be a bait for the old pike, I see no reason in the law of nature but I may snap at him: let time shape, and there an end.</LINE>

<LINE offset="7">Then, my lord,</LINE>
<LINE>Unto your Grace do I in chief address</LINE>
<LINE>The substance of my speech. If that rebellion</LINE>
<LINE>Came like itself, in base and abject routs,</LINE>
<LINE>Led on by bloody youth, guarded with rage,</LINE>
<LINE>And countenanc&#8217;d by boys and beggary&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>I say, if damn&#8217;d commotion so appear&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>In his true, native, and most proper shape,</LINE>
<LINE>You, reverend father, and these noble lords</LINE>
<LINE>Had not been here to dress the ugly form</LINE>
<LINE>Of base and bloody insurrection</LINE>
<LINE>With your fair honors. You, Lord Archbishop,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose see is by a civil peace maintain&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose beard the silver hand of peace hath touch&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose learning and good letters peace hath tutor&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose white investments figure innocence,</LINE>
<LINE>The dove, and very blessed spirit of peace,</LINE>
<LINE>Wherefore do you so ill translate yourself</LINE>
<LINE>Out of the speech of peace that bears such grace,</LINE>
<LINE>Into the harsh and boist&#8217;rous tongue of war?</LINE>
<LINE>Turning your books to graves, your ink to blood,</LINE>
<LINE>Your pens to lances, and your tongue divine</LINE>
<LINE>To a loud trumpet and a point of war?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARCH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Wherefore do I this? So the question stands.</LINE>
<LINE>Briefly, to this end: we are all diseas&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>And with our surfeiting and wanton hours</LINE>
<LINE>Have brought ourselves into a burning fever,</LINE>
<LINE>And we must bleed for it; of which disease</LINE>
<LINE>Our late King Richard (being infected) died.</LINE>
<LINE>But, my most noble Lord of Westmorland,</LINE>
<LINE>I take not on me here as a physician,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor do I as an enemy to peace</LINE>
<LINE>Troop in the throngs of military men;</LINE>
<LINE>But rather show a while like fearful war</LINE>
<LINE>To diet rank minds sick of happiness,</LINE>
<LINE>And purge th&#8217; obstructions which begin to stop</LINE>
<LINE>Our very veins of life. Hear me more plainly.</LINE>
<LINE>I have in equal balance justly weigh&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>What wrongs our arms may do, what wrongs we suffer,</LINE>
<LINE>And find our griefs heavier than our offenses.</LINE>
<LINE>We see which way the stream of time doth run,</LINE>
<LINE>And are enforc&#8217;d from our most quiet there</LINE>
<LINE>By the rough torrent of occasion,</LINE>
<LINE>And have the summary of all our griefs</LINE>
<LINE>(When time shall serve) to show in articles;</LINE>
<LINE>Which long ere this we offer&#8217;d to the King,</LINE>
<LINE>And might by no suit gain our audience.</LINE>
<LINE>When we are wrong&#8217;d and would unfold our griefs,</LINE>
<LINE>We are denied access unto his person</LINE>
<LINE>Even by those men that most have done us wrong.</LINE>
<LINE>The dangers of the days but newly gone,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose memory is written on the earth</LINE>
<LINE>With yet appearing blood, and the examples</LINE>
<LINE>Of every minute&#8217;s instance (present now)</LINE>
<LINE>Hath put us in these ill-beseeming arms,</LINE>
<LINE>Not to break peace, or any branch of it,</LINE>
<LINE>But to establish here a peace indeed,</LINE>
<LINE>Concurring both in name and quality.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WEST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>When ever yet was your appeal denied?</LINE>
<LINE>Wherein have you been galled by the King?</LINE>
<LINE>What peer hath been suborn&#8217;d to grate on you?</LINE>
<LINE>That you should seal this lawless bloody book</LINE>
<LINE>Of forg&#8217;d rebellion with a seal divine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARCH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My brother general, the commonwealth,</LINE>
<LINE>I make my quarrel in particular.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WEST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There is no need of any such redress,</LINE>
<LINE>Or if there were, it not belongs to you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MOWB.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why not to him in part, and to us all</LINE>
<LINE>That feel the bruises of the days before,</LINE>
<LINE>And suffer the condition of these times</LINE>
<LINE>To lay a heavy and unequal hand</LINE>
<LINE>Upon our honors?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WEST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">O, my good Lord Mowbray,</LINE>
<LINE>Construe the times to their necessities,</LINE>
<LINE>And you shall say, indeed, it is the time,</LINE>
<LINE>And not the King, that doth you injuries.</LINE>
<LINE>Yet, for your part, it not appears to me,</LINE>
<LINE>Either from the King or in the present time,</LINE>
<LINE>That you should have an inch of any ground</LINE>
<LINE>To build a grief on. Were you not restor&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>To all the Duke of Norfolk&#8217;s signories,</LINE>
<LINE>Your noble and right well-rememb&#8217;red father&#8217;s?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MOWB.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What thing, in honor, had my father lost,</LINE>
<LINE>That need to be reviv&#8217;d and breath&#8217;d in me?</LINE>
<LINE>The King that lov&#8217;d him, as the state stood then,</LINE>
<LINE>Was force perforce compell&#8217;d to banish him;</LINE>
<LINE>And then that Henry Bullingbrook and he,</LINE>
<LINE>Being mounted and both roused in their seats,</LINE>
<LINE>Their neighing coursers daring of the spur,</LINE>
<LINE>Their armed staves in charge, their beavers down,</LINE>
<LINE>Their eyes of fire sparkling through sights of steel,</LINE>
<LINE>And the loud trumpet blowing them together;</LINE>
<LINE>Then, then, when there was nothing could have stay&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>My father from the breast of Bullingbrook,</LINE>
<LINE>O, when the King did throw his warder down</LINE>
<LINE>(His own life hung upon the staff he threw),</LINE>
<LINE>Then threw he down himself and all their lives</LINE>
<LINE>That by indictment and by dint of sword</LINE>
<LINE>Have since miscarried under Bullingbrook.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WEST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You speak, Lord Mowbray, now you know not what.</LINE>
<LINE>The Earl of Herford was reputed then</LINE>
<LINE>In England the most valiant gentleman.</LINE>
<LINE>Who knows on whom fortune would then have smil&#8217;d?</LINE>
<LINE>But if your father had been victor there,</LINE>
<LINE>He ne&#8217;er had borne it out of Coventry;</LINE>
<LINE>For all the country in a general voice</LINE>
<LINE>Cried hate upon him; and all their prayers and love</LINE>
<LINE>Were set on Herford, whom they doted on</LINE>
<LINE>And bless&#8217;d and grac&#8217;d and did, more than the King&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>But this is mere digression from my purpose.</LINE>
<LINE>Here come I from our princely general</LINE>
<LINE>To know your griefs, to tell you from his Grace</LINE>
<LINE>That he will give you audience, and wherein</LINE>
<LINE>It shall appear that your demands are just,</LINE>
<LINE>You shall enjoy them, every thing set off</LINE>
<LINE>That might so much as think you enemies.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MOWB.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But he hath forc&#8217;d us to compel this offer,</LINE>
<LINE>And it proceeds from policy, not love.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WEST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Mowbray, you overween to take it so;</LINE>
<LINE>This offer comes from mercy, not from fear.</LINE>
<LINE>For lo, within a ken our army lies:</LINE>
<LINE>Upon mine honor, all too confident</LINE>
<LINE>To give admittance to a thought of fear.</LINE>
<LINE>Our battle is more full of names than yours,</LINE>
<LINE>Our men more perfect in the use of arms,</LINE>
<LINE>Our armor all as strong, our cause the best;</LINE>
<LINE>Then reason will our hearts should be as good.</LINE>
<LINE>Say you not then our offer is compell&#8217;d.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MOWB.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, by my will we shall admit no parley.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WEST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That argues but the shame of your offense:</LINE>
<LINE>A rotten case abides no handling.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hath the Prince John a full commission,</LINE>
<LINE>In very ample virtue of his father,</LINE>
<LINE>To hear and absolutely to determine</LINE>
<LINE>Of what conditions we shall stand upon?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WEST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That is intended in the general&#8217;s name.</LINE>
<LINE>I muse you make so slight a question.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARCH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then take, my Lord of Westmorland, this schedule,</LINE>
<LINE>For this contains our general grievances:</LINE>
<LINE>Each several article herein redress&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>All members of our cause, both here and hence,</LINE>
<LINE>That are ensinewed to this action</LINE>
<LINE>Acquitted by a true substantial form</LINE>
<LINE>And present execution of our wills&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>To us and to our purposes confin&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>We come within our aweful banks again,</LINE>
<LINE>And knit our powers to the arm of peace.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WEST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This will I show the general. Please you, lords,</LINE>
<LINE>In sight of both our battles we may meet,</LINE>
<LINE>And either end in peace, which God so frame!</LINE>
<LINE>Or to the place of diff&#8217;rence call the swords</LINE>
<LINE>Which must decide it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARCH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">My lord, we will do so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit Westmorland.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MOWB.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There is a thing within my bosom tells me</LINE>
<LINE>That no conditions of our peace can stand.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fear you not that; if we can make our peace</LINE>
<LINE>Upon such large terms and so absolute</LINE>
<LINE>As our conditions shall consist upon,</LINE>
<LINE>Our peace shall stand as firm as rocky mountains.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MOWB.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yea, but our valuation shall be such</LINE>
<LINE>That every slight and false-derived cause,</LINE>
<LINE>Yea, every idle, nice, and wanton reason,</LINE>
<LINE>Shall to the King taste of this action,</LINE>
<LINE>That were our royal faiths martyrs in love,</LINE>
<LINE>We shall be winnow&#8217;d with so rough a wind</LINE>
<LINE>That even our corn shall seem as light as chaff,</LINE>
<LINE>And good from bad find no partition.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARCH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, no, my lord, note this: the King is weary</LINE>
<LINE>Of dainty and such picking grievances,</LINE>
<LINE>For he hath found to end one doubt by death</LINE>
<LINE>Revives two greater in the heirs of life;</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore will he wipe his tables clean</LINE>
<LINE>And keep no tell-tale to his memory</LINE>
<LINE>That may repeat and history his loss</LINE>
<LINE>To new remembrance; for full well he knows</LINE>
<LINE>He cannot so precisely weed this land</LINE>
<LINE>As his misdoubts present occasion.</LINE>
<LINE>His foes are so enrooted with his friends</LINE>
<LINE>That, plucking to unfix an enemy,</LINE>
<LINE>He doth unfasten so and shake a friend,</LINE>
<LINE>So that this land, like an offensive wife</LINE>
<LINE>That hath enrag&#8217;d him on to offer strokes,</LINE>
<LINE>As he is striking, holds his infant up</LINE>
<LINE>And hangs resolv&#8217;d correction in the arm</LINE>
<LINE>That was uprear&#8217;d to execution.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Besides, the King hath wasted all his rods</LINE>
<LINE>On late offenders, that he now doth lack</LINE>
<LINE>The very instruments of chastisement,</LINE>
<LINE>So that his power, like to a fangless lion,</LINE>
<LINE>May offer, but not hold.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARCH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">&#8217;Tis very true,</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore be assur&#8217;d, my good Lord Marshal,</LINE>
<LINE>If we do now make our atonement well,</LINE>
<LINE>Our peace will, like a broken limb united,</LINE>
<LINE>Grow stronger for the breaking.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>You are well encount&#8217;red here, my cousin Mowbray,</LINE>
<LINE>Good day to you, gentle Lord Archbishop,</LINE>
<LINE>And so to you, Lord Hastings, and to all.</LINE>
<LINE>My Lord of York, it better show&#8217;d with you</LINE>
<LINE>When that your flock, assembled by the bell,</LINE>
<LINE>Encircled you to hear with reverence</LINE>
<LINE>Your exposition on the holy text</LINE>
<LINE>Than now to see you here an iron man, talking,</LINE>
<LINE>Cheering a rout of rebels with your drum,</LINE>
<LINE>Turning the word to sword and life to death.</LINE>
<LINE>That man that sits within a monarch&#8217;s heart</LINE>
<LINE>And ripens in the sunshine of his favor,</LINE>
<LINE>Would he abuse the countenance of the King,</LINE>
<LINE>Alack, what mischiefs might he set abroach</LINE>
<LINE>In shadow of such greatness? With you, Lord Bishop,</LINE>
<LINE>It is even so. Who hath not heard it spoken</LINE>
<LINE>How deep you were within the books of God?</LINE>
<LINE>To us the speaker in his parliament,</LINE>
<LINE>To us th&#8217; imagin&#8217;d voice of God himself,</LINE>
<LINE>The very opener and intelligencer</LINE>
<LINE>Between the grace, the sanctities of heaven,</LINE>
<LINE>And our dull workings? O, who shall believe</LINE>
<LINE>But you misuse the reverence of your place,</LINE>
<LINE>Employ the countenance and grace of heav&#8217;n,</LINE>
<LINE>As a false favorite doth his prince&#8217;s name,</LINE>
<LINE>In deeds dishonorable? You have ta&#8217;en up,</LINE>
<LINE>Under the counterfeited zeal of God,</LINE>
<LINE>The subjects of his substitute, my father,</LINE>
<LINE>And both against the peace of heaven and him</LINE>
<LINE>Have here upswarm&#8217;d them.</LINE>

<LINE offset="5">Good my Lord of Lancaster,</LINE>
<LINE>I am not here against your father&#8217;s peace,</LINE>

<LINE>The time misord&#8217;red doth, in common sense,</LINE>
<LINE>Crowd us and crush us to this monstrous form</LINE>
<LINE>To hold our safety up. I sent your Grace</LINE>
<LINE>The parcels and particulars of our grief,</LINE>
<LINE>The which hath been with scorn shov&#8217;d from the court,</LINE>
<LINE>Whereon this Hydra son of war is born,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose dangerous eyes may well be charm&#8217;d asleep</LINE>
<LINE>With grant of our most just and right desires,</LINE>
<LINE>And true obedience, of this madness cured,</LINE>

<LINE>I like them all, and do allow them well,</LINE>

<LINE>My father&#8217;s purposes have been mistook,</LINE>

<LINE>Wrested his meaning and authority.</LINE>
<LINE>My lord, these griefs shall be with speed redress&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Upon my soul they shall. If this may please you,</LINE>
<LINE>Discharge your powers unto their several counties,</LINE>
<LINE>As we will ours, and here between the armies</LINE>
<LINE>Let&#8217;s drink together friendly and embrace,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have a whole school of tongues in this belly of mine, and not a tongue of them all speaks any other word but my name. And I had but a belly of any indifferency, I were simply the most active fellow in Europe. My womb, my womb, my womb undoes me. Here comes our general.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Prince John of Lancaster, Westmorland, Blunt, and the rest.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>P. JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The heat is past, follow no further now;</LINE>
<LINE>Call in the powers, good cousin Westmorland.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exit Westmorland. Retrait.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Now, Falstaff, where have you been all this while?</LINE>
<LINE>When every thing is ended, then you come.</LINE>
<LINE>These tardy tricks of yours will, on my life,</LINE>
<LINE>One time or other break some gallows&#8217; back.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would be sorry, my lord, but it should be thus. I never knew yet but rebuke and check was the reward of valor. Do you think me a swallow, an arrow, or a bullet? Have I, in my poor and old motion, the expedition of thought? I have speeded hither with the very extremest inch of possibility; I have found&#8217;red ninescore and odd posts, and here, travel-tainted as I am, have, in my pure and immaculate valor, taken Sir John Colevile of the Dale, a most furious knight and valorous enemy. But what of that? He saw me, and yielded, that I may justly say, with the hook-nos&#8217;d fellow of Rome, &#8220;There, cousin, I came, saw, and overcame.&#8221;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>P. JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It was more of his courtesy than your deserving.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know not: here he is, and here I yield him, and I beseech your Grace let it be book&#8217;d with the rest of this day&#8217;s deeds, or by the Lord, I will have it in a particular ballad else, with mine own picture on the top on&#8217;t (Colevile kissing my foot), to the which course if I be enforc&#8217;d, if you do not all show like gilt twopences to me, and I in the clear sky of fame o&#8217;ershine you as much as the full moon doth the cinders of the element (which show like pins&#8217; heads to her), believe not the word of the noble. Therefore let me have right, and let desert mount.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>P. JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thine&#8217;s too heavy to mount.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am, my lord, but as my betters are</LINE>

<LINE>My lord, I beseech you give me leave to go through Gloucestershire, and when you come to court stand my good lord in your good report.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>P. JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fare you well, Falstaff. I, in my condition,</LINE>
<LINE>Shall better speak of you than you deserve.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt all but Falstaff.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would you had the wit, &#8217;twere better than your dukedom. Good faith, this same young sober-blooded boy doth not love me, nor a man cannot make him laugh, but that&#8217;s no marvel, he drinks no wine. There&#8217;s never none of these demure boys come to any proof, for thin drink doth so over-cool their blood, and making many fish-meals, that they fall into a kind of male green-sickness, and then when they marry, they get wenches. They are generally fools and cowards, which some of us should be too, but for inflammation. A good sherris-sack hath a twofold operation in it. It ascends me into the brain, dries me there all the foolish and dull and crudy vapors which environ it, makes it apprehensive, quick, forgetive, full of nimble, fiery, and delectable shapes, which deliver&#8217;d o&#8217;er to the voice, the tongue, which is the birth, becomes excellent wit. The second property of your excellent sherris is the warming of the blood, which before (cold and settled) left the liver white and pale, which is the badge of pusillanimity and cowardice; but the sherris warms it, and makes it course from the inwards to the parts&#8217; extremes. It illumineth the face, which as a beacon gives warning to all the rest of this little kingdom, man, to arm, and then the vital commoners and inland petty spirits muster me all to their captain, the heart, who great and puff&#8217;d up with this retinue, doth any deed of courage; and this valor comes of sherris. So that skill in the weapon is nothing without sack (for that sets it a-work) and learning a mere hoard of gold kept by a devil, till sack commences it and sets it in act and use. Hereof comes it that Prince Harry is valiant, for the cold blood he did naturally inherit of his father, he hath, like lean, sterile, and bare land, manur&#8217;d, husbanded, and till&#8217;d with excellent endeavor of drinking good and good store of fertile sherris, that he is become very hot and valiant. If I had a thousand sons, the first humane principle I would teach them should be, to forswear thin potations and to addict themselves to sack.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Bardolph.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>How now, Bardolph?</LINE>

<LINE>No, my good lord, he is in presence here.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>What would my lord and father?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nothing but well to thee, Thomas of Clarence.</LINE>
<LINE>How chance thou art not with the Prince thy brother?</LINE>
<LINE>He loves thee, and thou dost neglect him, Thomas.</LINE>
<LINE>Thou hast a better place in his affection</LINE>
<LINE>Than all thy brothers. Cherish it, my boy;</LINE>
<LINE>And noble offices thou mayst effect</LINE>
<LINE>Of mediation, after I am dead,</LINE>
<LINE>Between his greatness and thy other brethren.</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore omit him not, blunt not his love,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor lose the good advantage of his grace</LINE>
<LINE>By seeming cold or careless of his will,</LINE>
<LINE>For he is gracious if he be observ&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>He hath a tear for pity, and a hand</LINE>
<LINE>Open as day for meting charity;</LINE>
<LINE>Yet notwithstanding, being incens&#8217;d, he is flint,</LINE>
<LINE>As humorous as winter, and as sudden</LINE>
<LINE>As flaws congealed in the spring of day.</LINE>
<LINE>His temper therefore must be well observ&#8217;d.</LINE>
<LINE>Chide him for faults, and do it reverently,</LINE>
<LINE>When you perceive his blood inclin&#8217;d to mirth;</LINE>
<LINE>But, being moody, give him time and scope,</LINE>
<LINE>Till that his passions, like a whale on ground,</LINE>
<LINE>Confound themselves with working. Learn this, Thomas,</LINE>
<LINE>And thou shalt prove a shelter to thy friends,</LINE>
<LINE>A hoop of gold to bind thy brothers in,</LINE>
<LINE>That the united vessel of their blood,</LINE>
<LINE>Mingled with venom of suggestion</LINE>
<LINE>(As, force perforce, the age will pour it in),</LINE>
<LINE>Shall never leak, though it do work as strong</LINE>
<LINE>As aconitum or rash gunpowder.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I shall observe him with all care and love.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Most subject is the fattest soil to weeds,</LINE>
<LINE>And he, the noble image of my youth,</LINE>
<LINE>Is overspread with them; therefore my grief</LINE>
<LINE>Stretches itself beyond the hour of death.</LINE>
<LINE>The blood weeps from my heart when I do shape,</LINE>
<LINE>In forms imaginary, th&#8217; unguided days</LINE>
<LINE>And rotten times that you shall look upon,</LINE>
<LINE>When I am sleeping with my ancestors.</LINE>
<LINE>For when his headstrong riot hath no curb,</LINE>
<LINE>When rage and hot blood are his counsellors,</LINE>
<LINE>When means and lavish manners meet together,</LINE>
<LINE>O, with what wings shall his affections fly</LINE>
<LINE>Towards fronting peril and oppos&#8217;d decay!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My gracious lord, you look beyond him quite:</LINE>
<LINE>The Prince but studies his companions</LINE>
<LINE>Like a strange tongue, wherein, to gain the language,</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis needful that the most immodest word</LINE>
<LINE>Be look&#8217;d upon and learnt, which once attain&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Your Highness knows, comes to no further use</LINE>
<LINE>But to be known and hated. So, like gross terms,</LINE>
<LINE>The Prince will in the perfectness of time</LINE>
<LINE>Cast off his followers, and their memory</LINE>
<LINE>Shall as a pattern or a measure live,</LINE>
<LINE>By which his Grace must mete the lives of other,</LINE>

<LINE>Washing with kindly tears his gentle cheeks,</LINE>
<LINE>With such a deep demeanor in great sorrow</LINE>
<LINE>That tyranny, which never quaff&#8217;d but blood,</LINE>
<LINE>Would, by beholding him, have wash&#8217;d his knife</LINE>
<LINE>With gentle eye-drops. He is coming hither.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But wherefore did he take away the crown?</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Prince Harry.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Lo where he comes. Come hither to me, Harry.</LINE>
<LINE>Depart the chamber, leave us here alone.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt Warwick and the rest.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I never thought to hear you speak again.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thy wish was father, Harry, to that thought:</LINE>
<LINE>I stay too long by thee, I weary thee.</LINE>
<LINE>Dost thou so hunger for mine empty chair</LINE>
<LINE>That thou wilt needs invest thee with my honors</LINE>
<LINE>Before thy hour be ripe? O foolish youth,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou seek&#8217;st the greatness that will overwhelm thee.</LINE>
<LINE>Stay but a little, for my cloud of dignity</LINE>
<LINE>Is held from falling with so weak a wind</LINE>
<LINE>That it will quickly drop; my day is dim.</LINE>
<LINE>Thou hast stol&#8217;n that which after some few hours</LINE>
<LINE>Were thine without offense, and at my death</LINE>
<LINE>Thou hast seal&#8217;d up my expectation.</LINE>
<LINE>Thy life did manifest thou lov&#8217;dst me not,</LINE>
<LINE>And thou wilt have me die assur&#8217;d of it.</LINE>
<LINE>Thou hid&#8217;st a thousand daggers in thy thoughts,</LINE>
<LINE>Whom thou hast whetted on thy stony heart</LINE>
<LINE>To stab at half an hour of my life.</LINE>
<LINE>What, canst thou not forbear me half an hour?</LINE>
<LINE>Then get thee gone, and dig my grave thyself,</LINE>
<LINE>And bid the merry bells ring to thine ear</LINE>
<LINE>That thou art crowned, not that I am dead.</LINE>
<LINE>Let all the tears that should bedew my hearse</LINE>
<LINE>Be drops of balm to sanctify thy head;</LINE>
<LINE>Only compound me with forgotten dust;</LINE>
<LINE>Give that which gave thee life unto the worms,</LINE>
<LINE>Pluck down my officers, break my decrees,</LINE>
<LINE>For now a time is come to mock at form.</LINE>
<LINE>Harry the Fifth is crown&#8217;d! Up, vanity!</LINE>
<LINE>Down, royal state! All you sage counsellors, hence!</LINE>
<LINE>And to the English court assemble now,</LINE>
<LINE>From every region, apes of idleness!</LINE>
<LINE>Now, neighbor confines, purge you of your scum!</LINE>
<LINE>Have you a ruffin that will swear, drink, dance,</LINE>
<LINE>Revel the night, rob, murder, and commit</LINE>
<LINE>The oldest sins the newest kind of ways?</LINE>
<LINE>Be happy, he will trouble you no more.</LINE>
<LINE>England shall double gild his treble guilt,</LINE>
<LINE>England shall give him office, honor, might;</LINE>
<LINE>For the fift Harry from curb&#8217;d license plucks</LINE>
<LINE>The muzzle of restraint, and the wild dog</LINE>
<LINE>Shall flesh his tooth on every innocent.</LINE>
<LINE>O my poor kingdom, sick with civil blows!</LINE>
<LINE>When that my care could not withhold thy riots,</LINE>
<LINE>What wilt thou do when riot is thy care?</LINE>
<LINE>O, thou wilt be a wilderness again,</LINE>
<LINE>Peopled with wolves, thy old inhabitants!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, pardon me, my liege! But for my tears,</LINE>
<LINE>The moist impediments unto my speech,</LINE>
<LINE>I had forestall&#8217;d this dear and deep rebuke</LINE>
<LINE>Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard</LINE>
<LINE>The course of it so far. There is your crown;</LINE>
<LINE>And He that wears the crown immortally</LINE>
<LINE>Long guard it yours! If I affect it more</LINE>
<LINE>Than as your honor and as your renown,</LINE>
<LINE>Let me no more from this obedience rise,</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Kneels.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Which my most inward true and duteous spirit</LINE>
<LINE>Teacheth this prostrate and exterior bending.</LINE>
<LINE>God witness with me, when I here came in,</LINE>
<LINE>And found no course of breath within your Majesty,</LINE>
<LINE>How cold it strook my heart! If I do feign,</LINE>
<LINE>O, let me in my present wildness die,</LINE>
<LINE>And never live to show th&#8217; incredulous world</LINE>
<LINE>The noble change that I have purposed!</LINE>
<LINE>Coming to look on you, thinking you dead,</LINE>
<LINE>And dead almost, my liege, to think you were,</LINE>
<LINE>I spake unto this crown as having sense,</LINE>
<LINE>And thus upbraided it: &#8220;The care on thee depending</LINE>
<LINE>Hath fed upon the body of my father;</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore thou best of gold art worst of gold.</LINE>
<LINE>Other, less fine in carat, is more precious,</LINE>
<LINE>Preserving life in med&#8217;cine potable;</LINE>
<LINE>But thou, most fine, most honor&#8217;d, most renown&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Hast eat thy bearer up.&#8221; Thus, my most royal liege,</LINE>
<LINE>Accusing it, I put it on my head,</LINE>
<LINE>To try with it, as with an enemy</LINE>
<LINE>That had before my face murdered my father,</LINE>
<LINE>The quarrel of a true inheritor.</LINE>
<LINE>But if it did infect my blood with joy,</LINE>
<LINE>Or swell my thoughts to any strain of pride,</LINE>
<LINE>If any rebel or vain spirit of mine</LINE>
<LINE>Did with the least affection of a welcome</LINE>
<LINE>Give entertainment to the might of it,</LINE>
<LINE>Let God forever keep it from my head,</LINE>
<LINE>And make me as the poorest vassal is</LINE>
<LINE>That doth with awe and terror kneel to it!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O my son,</LINE>
<LINE>God put it in thy mind to take it hence,</LINE>
<LINE>That thou mightst win the more thy father&#8217;s love,</LINE>
<LINE>Pleading so wisely in excuse of it!</LINE>
<LINE>Come hither, Harry, sit thou by my bed,</LINE>
<LINE>And hear (I think) the very latest counsel</LINE>
<LINE>That ever I shall breathe. God knows, my son,</LINE>
<LINE>By what by-paths and indirect crook&#8217;d ways</LINE>
<LINE>I met this crown, and I myself know well</LINE>
<LINE>How troublesome it sate upon my head.</LINE>
<LINE>To thee it shall descend with better quiet,</LINE>
<LINE>Better opinion, better confirmation,</LINE>
<LINE>For all the soil of the achievement goes</LINE>
<LINE>With me into the earth. It seem&#8217;d in me</LINE>
<LINE>But as an honor snatch&#8217;d with boist&#8217;rous hand,</LINE>
<LINE>And I had many living to upbraid</LINE>
<LINE>My gain of it by their assistances,</LINE>
<LINE>Which daily grew to quarrel and to bloodshed,</LINE>
<LINE>Wounding supposed peace. All these bold fears</LINE>
<LINE>Thou seest with peril I have answered;</LINE>
<LINE>For all my reign hath been but as a scene</LINE>
<LINE>Acting that argument. And now my death</LINE>
<LINE>Changes the mood, for what in me was purchas&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>Falls upon thee in a more fairer sort;</LINE>
<LINE>So thou the garland wear&#8217;st successively.</LINE>
<LINE>Yet though thou stand&#8217;st more sure than I could do,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou art not firm enough, since griefs are green,</LINE>
<LINE>And all my friends, which thou must make thy friends,</LINE>
<LINE>Have but their stings and teeth newly ta&#8217;en out;</LINE>
<LINE>By whose fell working I was first advanc&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>And by whose power I well might lodge a fear</LINE>
<LINE>To be again displac&#8217;d; which to avoid,</LINE>
<LINE>I cut them off, and had a purpose now</LINE>
<LINE>To lead out many to the Holy Land,</LINE>
<LINE>Lest rest and lying still might make them look</LINE>
<LINE>Too near unto my state. Therefore, my Harry,</LINE>
<LINE>Be it thy course to busy giddy minds</LINE>
<LINE>With foreign quarrels, that action, hence borne out,</LINE>
<LINE>May waste the memory of the former days.</LINE>
<LINE>More would I, but my lungs are wasted so</LINE>
<LINE>That strength of speech is utterly denied me.</LINE>
<LINE>How I came by the crown, O God forgive,</LINE>
<LINE>And grant it may with thee in true peace live!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My gracious liege,</LINE>
<LINE>You won it, wore it, kept it, gave it me;</LINE>
<LINE>Then plain and right must my possession be,</LINE>
<LINE>Which I with more than with a common pain</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Gainst all the world will rightfully maintain.</LINE>

<LINE>Marry, sir, thus; those precepts cannot be serv&#8217;d; and again, sir, shall we sow the hade land with wheat?</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>With red wheat, Davy. But for William cook&#8212;are there no young pigeons?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DAVY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, sir. Here is now the smith&#8217;s note for shoeing and plough-irons.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Now, sir, a new link to the bucket must needs be had; and, sir, do you mean to stop any of William&#8217;s wages, about the sack he lost at Hinckley fair?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SHAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;A shall answer it. Some pigeons, Davy, a couple of short-legg&#8217;d hens, a joint of mutton, and any pretty little tiny kickshaws, tell William cook.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DAVY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Doth the man of war stay all night, sir?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SHAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yea, Davy, I will use him well. A friend i&#8217; th&#8217; court is better than a penny in purse. Use his men well, Davy, for they are arrant knaves, and will backbite.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DAVY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No worse than they are backbitten, sir, for they have marvail&#8217;s foul linen.</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SHAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There is many complaints, Davy, against that Visor. That Visor is an arrant knave, on my knowledge.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DAVY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I grant your worship that he is a knave, sir; but yet God forbid, sir, but a knave should have some countenance at his friend&#8217;s request. An honest man, sir, is able to speak for himself, when a knave is not. I have serv&#8217;d your worship truly, sir, this eight years; and I cannot once or twice in a quarter bear out a knave against an honest man, I have little credit with your worship. The knave is mine honest friend, sir, therefore I beseech you let him be countenanc&#8217;d.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SHAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go to, I say, he shall have no wrong. Look about, Davy.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt Bardolph and Page.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>If I were saw&#8217;d into quantities, I should make four dozen of such bearded hermits&#8217; staves as Master Shallow. It is a wonderful thing to see the semblable coherence of his men&#8217;s spirits and his. They, by observing him, do bear themselves like foolish justices; he, by conversing with them, is turn&#8217;d into a justice-like servingman. Their spirits are so married in conjunction with the participation of society that they flock together in consent, like so many wild geese. If I had a suit to Master Shallow, I would humor his men with the imputation of being near their master; if to his men, I would curry with Master Shallow that no man could better command his servants. It is certain that either wise bearing or ignorant carriage is caught, as men take diseases, one of another; therefore let men take heed of their company. I will devise matter enough out of this Shallow to keep Prince Harry in continual laughter the wearing out of six fashions, which is four terms, or two actions, and &#8217;a shall laugh without intervallums. O, it is much that a lie with a slight oath and a jest with a sad brow will do with a fellow that never had the ache in his shoulders! O, you shall see him laugh till his face be like a wet cloak ill laid up.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>PRINCE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This new and gorgeous garment, majesty,</LINE>
<LINE>Sits not so easy on me as you think.</LINE>
<LINE>Brothers, you mix your sadness with some fear:</LINE>
<LINE>This is the English, not the Turkish court,</LINE>
<LINE>Not Amurath an Amurath succeeds,</LINE>
<LINE>But Harry Harry. Yet be sad, good brothers,</LINE>
<LINE>For by my faith it very well becomes you.</LINE>
<LINE>Sorrow so royally in you appears</LINE>
<LINE>That I will deeply put the fashion on</LINE>
<LINE>And wear it in my heart. Why then be sad,</LINE>
<LINE>But entertain no more of it, good brothers,</LINE>
<LINE>Than a joint burden laid upon us all.</LINE>
<LINE>For me, by heaven (I bid you be assur&#8217;d),</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll be your father and your brother too.</LINE>
<LINE>Let me but bear your love, I&#8217;ll bear your cares.</LINE>
<LINE>Yet weep that Harry&#8217;s dead, and so will I,</LINE>

<LINE>May this be wash&#8217;d in Lethe and forgotten?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CH. JUST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I then did use the person of your father,</LINE>
<LINE>The image of his power lay then in me,</LINE>
<LINE>And in th&#8217; administration of his law,</LINE>
<LINE>Whiles I was busy for the commonwealth,</LINE>
<LINE>Your Highness pleased to forget my place,</LINE>
<LINE>The majesty and power of law and justice,</LINE>
<LINE>The image of the King whom I presented,</LINE>
<LINE>And strook me in my very seat of judgment;</LINE>
<LINE>Whereon (as an offender to your father)</LINE>
<LINE>I gave bold way to my authority,</LINE>
<LINE>And did commit you. If the deed were ill,</LINE>
<LINE>Be you contented, wearing now the garland,</LINE>
<LINE>To have a son set your decrees at nought?</LINE>
<LINE>To pluck down justice from your aweful bench?</LINE>
<LINE>To trip the course of law and blunt the sword</LINE>
<LINE>That guards the peace and safety of your person?</LINE>
<LINE>Nay more, to spurn at your most royal image,</LINE>
<LINE>And mock your workings in a second body?</LINE>
<LINE>Question your royal thoughts, make the case yours:</LINE>
<LINE>Be now the father and propose a son,</LINE>
<LINE>Hear your own dignity so much profan&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>See your most dreadful laws so loosely slighted,</LINE>
<LINE>Behold yourself so by a son disdained;</LINE>
<LINE>And then imagine me taking your part,</LINE>
<LINE>And in your power soft silencing your son.</LINE>
<LINE>After this cold considerance, sentence me,</LINE>
<LINE>And as you are a king, speak in your state</LINE>
<LINE>What I have done that misbecame my place,</LINE>
<LINE>My person, or my liege&#8217;s sovereignty.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You are right justice, and you weigh this well,</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore still bear the balance and the sword,</LINE>
<LINE>And I do wish your honors may increase,</LINE>
<LINE>Till you do live to see a son of mine</LINE>

<LINE>That dares do justice on my proper son;</LINE>

<LINE>To your well-practic&#8217;d wise directions.</LINE>
<LINE>And, princes all, believe me, I beseech you,</LINE>
<LINE>My father is gone wild into his grave;</LINE>
<LINE>For in his tomb lie my affections,</LINE>
<LINE>And with his spirits sadly I survive,</LINE>
<LINE>To mock the expectation of the world,</LINE>
<LINE>To frustrate prophecies, and to rase out</LINE>
<LINE>Rotten opinion, who hath writ me down</LINE>
<LINE>After my seeming. The tide of blood in me</LINE>
<LINE>Hath proudly flow&#8217;d in vanity till now;</LINE>
<LINE>Now doth it turn and ebb back to the sea,</LINE>
<LINE>Where it shall mingle with the state of floods,</LINE>
<LINE>And flow henceforth in formal majesty.</LINE>
<LINE>Now call we our high court of parliament,</LINE>
<LINE>And let us choose such limbs of noble counsel</LINE>
<LINE>That the great body of our state may go</LINE>
<LINE>In equal rank with the best govern&#8217;d nation,</LINE>
<LINE>That war, or peace, or both at once, may be</LINE>
<LINE>As things acquainted and familiar to us,</LINE>
<LINE>In which you, father, shall have foremost hand.</LINE>
<LINE>Our coronation done, we will accite</LINE>
<LINE>(As I before rememb&#8217;red) all our state,</LINE>
<LINE>And (God consigning to my good intents)</LINE>
<LINE>No prince nor peer shall have just cause to say,</LINE>

<LINE>That can hardly be, Master Shallow. Do not you grieve at this, I shall be sent for in private to him. Look you, he must seem thus to the world. Fear not your advancements, I will be the man yet that shall make you great.</LINE>

<LINE>Sir, I will be as good as my word. This that you heard was but a color.</LINE>

<LINE>I like this fair proceeding of the King&#8217;s.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>EPILOGUE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>First my fear, then my cur&#8217;sy, last my speech. My fear, is your displeasure, my cur&#8217;sy, my duty, and my speech, to beg your pardons. If you look for a good speech now, you undo me, for what I have to say is of mine own making, and what indeed (I should say) will (I doubt) prove mine own marring. But to the purpose, and so to the venture. Be it known to you, as it is very well, I was lately here in the end of a displeasing play, to pray your patience for it and to promise you a better. I meant indeed to pay you with this, which if like an ill venture it come unluckily home, I break, and you, my gentle creditors, lose. Here I promis&#8217;d you I would be, and here I commit my body to your mercies. Bate me some, and I will pay you some, and (as most debtors do) promise you infinitely; and so I kneel down before you&#8212;but, indeed, to pray for the Queen.</LINE>
<LINE>If my tongue cannot entreat you to acquit me, will you command me to use my legs? And yet that were but light payment, to dance out of your debt. But a good conscience will make any possible satisfaction, and so would I. All the gentlewomen here have forgiven me; if the gentlemen will not, then the gentlemen do not agree with the gentlewomen, which was never seen in such an assembly.</LINE>
<LINE>One word more, I beseech you. If you be not too much cloy&#8217;d with fat meat, our humble author will continue the story, with Sir John in it, and make you merry with fair Katherine of France, where (for any thing I know) Falstaff shall die of a sweat, unless already &#8217;a be kill&#8217;d with your hard opinions; for Oldcastle died a martyr, and this is not the man. My tongue is weary, when my legs are too, I will bid you good night.</LINE>
