<persona gender="male">
<persname short="KING.">King Henry the Fourth</persname>
<persdescription>King Henry IV is the same as the Bullingbrook of <persnameref>Richard II</persnameref> and the King of <persnameref>Henry IV, Part One</persnameref>. Much older and wearier now, he suffers dreadfully from insomnia and lingering guilt over his usurpation of the throne. Rebellions against him continually keep him from going on crusade to Jerusalem as he hopes to do in expiation of his guilt. He is subject to fits where his vision blurs before he falls unconscious, and slips into coma-like sleeps where it is impossible to tell if he is still alive. If continual treasons against him and physical illness were not enough, his cares are increased by the fact that his eldest son and heir, Prince Harry, is a wastrel who spends most of his time in bars and has even been thrown in jail for being publicly disorderly. The King is too ill to lead his armies against the new rebellion himself, and has to entrust his forces to his second son, John of Lancaster rather than to his heir. Henry has lost all hope for Prince Harry, and is driven to the point of begging his three other sons to restrain their brother once the latter takes the throne. The combination of paternal disappointment and worry for his kingdom drives him to a passionate outburst even on his deathbed. He is reconciled with Harry just prior to his death. Known as a crafty politician, Henry is still enough of one as he lies dying that he can recommend that Harry avoid rebellions against himself by spending all of the nobles&#8217; energies in fighting wars elsewhere. Haunted by a prophecy that he should die in Jerusalem, he fulfills it by insisting on being carried to a chamber of that name within his palace. Henry is as much as he can be a just king, glad to have servants who respect the law, and approving of the Lord Chief Justice for not treating Prince Harry any differently from other troublemakers.</persdescription>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="PRINCE.">Prince Henry</persname>
<persaliases>
	<persname short="BOTH PRINCE. AND POINS.">Both Prince and Poins</persname>
</persaliases>
<persdescription>Prince Harry, sometimes known as Monmouth, is the same as the Prince of <persnameref>Henry IV, Part One</persnameref>. Despite his apparent reformation in that play, he has since the battle of Shrewsbury gone back to his disreputable ways, playing pranks on Falstaff, mocking Poins, consorting with prostitutes and tavern-keepers. He has even been sent to prison after being publicly disorderly and slapping the Lord Chief Justice in court. He spends much less time with Falstaff, however, beginning to neglect him and preparing for his rejection once he takes the throne. Despite what King Henry and the whole world believes, he loves his father, but he is aware that saying so would have him tagged as a hypocrite because of his past conduct. He is extremely concerned about how he appears to the world, due to his master plan of setting himself up as a wastrel so that his reputation will be enhanced when he gives up that behavior on taking the throne. He is very quick to pick up the crown when he thinks that his father is dead; though he insists he did so to get used to the idea of kingship, his excuses are undercut by the fact that they are spoken in retrospect, and do not fully match what the audience saw on stage. As he is extremely successful at playing roles, the truth behind his feelings remains unknown. As King, he tests the loyalty of the Lord Chief Justice to make certain that fear of his new power will not undercut the old man&#8217;s honesty. His rejection of Falstaff and rounding up of his old companions has exactly the effect that he planned it to. Both as Prince and as King it is difficult to discern what his genuine emotions are; whether casting off his dissipation causes him any pain is up to the performer. Taking his father&#8217;s last words of advice, he plans a war in France to occupy his noblemen&#8217;s minds and energies and thus forestall rebellion. How this turns out can be discovered in <persnameref>Henry V</persnameref>.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="P. JOHN.">Prince John of Lancaster</persname>
<persdescription>Prince John of Lancaster is King Henry&#8217;s second son, and Prince Harry&#8217;s brother &#8212; the same as in <persnameref>Henry IV, Part One</persnameref>. A humorless man who drinks no alcohol and puts up poorly with Falstaff, he is a cold politician with a lawyer&#8217;s instinct for precise, hairsplitting words that enable him to trick the rebels into letting their soldiers go, thus avoiding a battle. He is quick to have rebels executed. He knows and respects the Lord Chief Justice, and shares his opinion of Prince Harry until the latter reassures them of his reformation. He has his ear to the ground and has a fair idea of what the new King&#8217;s next actions will be.</persdescription>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="GLOU.">Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester</persname>
<persaliases>
	<persname short="GLOU. AND CLAR.">Both Gloucester and Clarence</persname>
</persaliases>
<persdescription>Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester is one of King Henry&#8217;s sons, and Prince Harry&#8217;s brother. As his father grows weaker, he grows worried about the public restlessness at the odd portents suggesting that the King is dying. He is as uncertain of Prince Harry&#8217;s worth as the others. He returns in <persnameref>Henry V</persnameref>.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="CLAR.">Thomas, Duke of Clarence</persname>
<persaliases>
	<persname short="GLOU. AND CLAR.">Both Gloucester and Clarence</persname>
</persaliases>
<persdescription>Thomas, Duke of Clarence is one of King Henry&#8217;s sons, and Prince Harry&#8217;s brother. Of the King&#8217;s four sons, he is the closest to Harry, something that the King hopes will allow him to be a good influence once Harry takes the throne. He is worried about his father&#8217;s health. He returns in <persnameref>Henry V</persnameref>.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="NORTH.">Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland</persname>
<persdescription>The Earl of Northumberland is the same as the Northumberland of <persnameref>Richard II </persnameref>and <persnameref>Henry IV, Part One</persnameref>. Having once helped Henry IV to usurp the throne, he is now theoretically rebelling against him. However, at the beginning of the play he is still pretending to be sick, which was his excuse for not joining his son Hotspur at the battle of Shrewsbury, leaving the latter under-strength; and he will later choose not to reinforce the Archbishop of York and the other rebels, with much the same results. The death of his son breaks his heart and leads him to rage against the King and help organize the second rebellion, but he is convinced by his wife and daughter-in-law to wait and see who will overcome rather than join in from the start. Waiting in Scotland, he raises an army with Lord Bardolph, but is beaten in battle by the Sheriff of Yorkshire. He is an old man, highly respected and powerful.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="ARCH.">Richard Scroop, Archbishop of York</persname>
<persdescription>Scroop, Archbishop of York is the same as the character of the same name in <persnameref>Henry IV, Part One</persnameref>. Longing for revenge for the death of his brother Stephen (see <persnameref>Richard II</persnameref>), he grows convinces that the ills afflicting the country can be laid squarely at Henry IV&#8217;s door for his usurpation of the throne. He lends dignity to the rebellion by bringing the weight of his position behind it, and uses revenge for Richard II&#8217;s overthrow and murder as the official excuse for the uprising. He despises the common people, partly for their changeable opinions, and blames them for the state of affairs as it was Bullingbrook&#8217;s popularity with them that allowed him to easily take the throne. He is not as bright as he thinks he is, nor as good a judge of character; his certainty about what the King will do does not take into consideration the character of Prince John, whom he trusts far too readily, with the unfortunate result that he gets his head chopped off. He is an older man, whose beard is turning white.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="MOWB.">Lord Mowbray</persname>
<persdescription>Thomas, Lord Mowbray is the Earl Marshal of England, who joins the rebellion against the King. He is the son of the Mowbray of <persnameref>Richard II</persnameref>, who was supposed to fight a duel to the death with Bullingbrook, now King Henry IV. Not particularly intelligent, he is the most hot-headed of the rebels, partly for his father&#8217;s sake, though his understanding of that situation is less than perfect. He disapproves of the peace that the Archbishop negotiates with Prince John, as he would rather have fought it out; as it turns out, he is quite right to wish so, since the peace simply has him arrested and beheaded.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="HAST.">Lord Hastings</persname>
<persdescription>Lord Hastings is one of the rebels against King Henry IV. More optimistic than either the Archbishop or Lord Bardolph, he discounts the necessity of Northumberland&#8217;s support in making plans, trusting in the fact that the king&#8217;s own forces are divided into three armies in different parts of the country. Certain that the King is weak, he is foolish enough to think that a few threats will suffice, and he agrees to disperse the rebel army once Prince John has sworn to rectify the wrongs the rebels complain of. This overconfidence gets his head chopped off.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="L. BARD.">Lord Bardolph</persname>
<persdescription>Lord Bardolph is one of the rebels against King Henry IV, who having heard that all was going well for their party rushes to the Earl of Northumberland&#8217;s to tell him that they&#8217;ve won. Not the best of news-gatherers, he forgets to double-check his sources, and is reluctant to admit that he was wrong. He proposes continuing the rebellion despite the scale of the defeat at Shrewsbury. He is much more cautious in planning the second campaign, insisting that it be properly thought out before it is begun. He is well-known enough to the Earl of Northumberland that the latter&#8217;s staff allow him access to the Earl&#8217;s house. He joins the latter in Scotland, where they raise an army but are defeated by the Sheriff of Yorkshire. Lord Bardolph is not to be confused with Falstaff&#8217;s companion of the same name.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="TRA.">Travers</persname>
<persdescription>Travers is one of Northumberland&#8217;s servants, whom he sent to find out news of the battle of Shrewsbury. Returning, he can bring no certain news, only report that Lord Bardolph suggested things were going well but that he passed another gentleman who claimed just the opposite.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="COL.">Sir John Colevile</persname>
<persdescription>Sir John Coleville is one of the rebels against King Henry IV. He surrenders to Falstaff after the rebels are tricked into defeat. He insists that in the place of his leaders he would have fought Prince John instead, and also that he only rebelled because of his superiors. This excuse does not do him any good, and he is carted off to be executed.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="WAR.">Earl of Warwick</persname>
<persdescription>Warwick is one of King Henry&#8217;s noblemen, a loyal, reasonable and optimistic man. He seeks at all times to reassure his master and to help his comfort, whether it be in lowering the estimates of the rebels&#8217; strength or hushing the princes to keep the King from hearing their discussion of his coming death. He is the only member of the court to suspect that Prince Harry&#8217;s dissipation might be a deception. Despite his reassurances to the King on the matter, however, he is concerned that Harry will prove the disappointment all the other courtiers fear. He returns in <persnameref>Henry V</persnameref>.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="WEST.">Earl of Westmorland</persname>
<persdescription>Westmorland is one of Henry IV&#8217;s lords, the same character as in <persnameref>Henry IV, Part One</persnameref>. Prince John sends him as an emissary to the rebels, with whom he argues at length over the justice of their cause. Mowbray&#8217;s misunderstanding of history leads him to scorn the young man. As the Prince&#8217;s second-in-command, he is an essential part of the plot to arrest the rebel leaders, convincing them that all is well, drinking with them, and offering a reasonable excuse for why the royal army has not dispersed. He has no philosophical difficulties with acting dishonorably towards traitors.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="SURR.">Earl of Surrey</persname>
<persdescription>Surrey [mute role] is a nobleman highly trusted by Henry IV, one of the first he speaks to when he receives news of the new rebellion.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="BLUNT.">Sir John Blunt</persname>
<persdescription>Sir John Blunt [mute role] is one of King Henry IV&#8217;s noblemen, among the first he calls when he hears of the new rebellion. He is sent with Prince John to deal with the Archbishop&#8217;s army, and is charged with taking Coleville and his men to be executed. He accompanies Prince John back to the palace.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="GOW.">Gower</persname>
<persdescription>Gower brings news to the Lord Chief Justice that the King and Prince Harry have returned from the wars in Wales and that part of the army has gone to reinforce Prince John&#8217;s forces against the rebels.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="HAR.">Harcourt</persname>
<persdescription>Harcourt is a messenger who comes from Scotland to announce to the King that Northumberland and Lord Bardolph have been defeated.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="CH. JUST.">Lord Chief Justice</persname>
<persdescription>Lord Chief Justice is the highest judge of the land, equivalent to the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. An old man with a strong sense of his responsibilities, he once imprisoned Prince Harry for public disorderliness after the latter hit him across the face in court. Upright and honest, he loathes Falstaff and all he stands for, and especially his influence on the heir to the throne. He worries about what will occur when the latter takes the throne, and fears that all the good done in Henry IV&#8217;s reign will be undone by Henry V. Refusing to flatter, he resists the temptation to speak well of Falstaff to the new King, and does not apologize for having sent him to prison. He is rewarded by keeping his place and being promised that he will be the new King&#8217;s chief advisor, and is later given charge of ensuring that Falstaff obey his banishment.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="POINS.">Poins</persname>
<persaliases>
	<persname short="BOTH PRINCE. AND POINS.">Both Prince and Poins</persname>
</persaliases>
<persdescription>Poins is Prince Harry&#8217;s companion and accomplice, leading him on in his dissipated life. He is little more respectable than Falstaff and his crew, with whom he has an ongoing rivalry. Not overly rich, as he is a younger son, he has a rather small wardrobe. He is not afraid of speaking his true opinions before the Prince.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="FAL.">Sir John Falstaff</persname>
<persdescription>Sir John Falstaff is an excessively fat, excessively drunken, excessively cowardly, excessively witty, and excessively incorrigible rogue. Utterly shameless, he can talk his way out of almost any situation and rationalize any action, though he does not pull the wool over most courtiers&#8217; eyes. Commoners are much more easily impressed by him. He is convinced that he still has Prince Harry&#8217;s love and that when the latter comes to the throne he will be the most influential man in the kingdom. Being rather poor, Falstaff tends to borrow inordinate amounts of money from people; he charms Hostess Quickly so much that even after she attempts to have him arrested for debt he can milk yet more money from her. He has often proposed marriage to her, keeping her in hope even as she arranges for him to enjoy Doll Tearsheet&#8217;s favors. He is very fond of Doll, the only person in whose presence he admits to feeling his age. He is not only fat and white-bearded: too much eating has given him gout, and too much time with whores has struck him with venereal disease, and he can no longer even tell which pains are caused by which disease. He has something of a feud with the Lord Chief Justice, who despises him and his influence on the Prince. He is easily bribed into letting draftees avoid the army, and can justify doing so. Calling on his old acquaintance Justice Shallow while mustering soldiers, he is able to cajole him into lending him a thousand pounds, for the sake of which he puts up with the old man&#8217;s nattering. Hearing of Prince Harry&#8217;s accession to the throne, he is so excited that he gallops full-tilt to London, willing to steal horses to do so, where he interrupts the new King&#8217;s coronation procession in the most shocking fashion. Rejected by the King, he attempts to convince his companions and himself that this is merely Harry putting on a show for the sake of respectability, but on being arrested by the Lord Chief Justice his argument falters. What happens to him afterwards is told in <persnameref>Henry V</persnameref>.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="BARD.">Bardolph</persname>
<persdescription>Bardolph is one of Falstaff&#8217;s followers, a man with a huge red nose and red marks all over his face. He is Falstaff&#8217;s assistant, collecting money from the drafted men who wish to bribe their way out of the army, fighting Pistol, delivering messages, and so forth. A rogue, he is arrested along with Falstaff at the end of the play. Not to be confused with the rebel Lord Bardolph, his further adventures are chronicled in <persnameref>Henry V</persnameref>.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="PIST.">Pistol</persname>
<persdescription>Ancient Pistol is an officer in the army, an ensign-bearer. He is a swaggering braggart, trying to intimidate everyone he meets, speaking in overblown terms and stuffing his speech with foreign phrases and curses. It is said that he and Doll Tearsheet beat a man who later dies of his injuries. Pistol rushes to find Falstaff when Henry IV dies, hoping to rise in favor with the new King as Falstaff does. Unfortunately for him, this merely leads to his arrest. His further adventures are chronicled in <persnameref>Henry V</persnameref>.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="RUM.">Rumor, the Presenter</persname>
<persdescription>Rumor, the Presenter speaks the Prologue of the play, reminding us of what occurred in <persnameref>Henry IV, Part One</persnameref> and setting the scene for the confusion of the first scene. Dressed in a costume covered in wagging tongues, Rumor is quite proud of itself and its effect on the world, and delighted at the opportunity to spread false news about the result of the battle of Shrewsbury.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="PORT.">Porter</persname>
<persdescription>The Porter guards the Earl of Northumberland&#8217;s gate. He knows Lord Bardolph well enough to let him go through to the orchard without further ado when the latter arrives.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="EPILOGUE.">Epilogue</persname>
<persdescription>Epilogue comes forward at the end to plead for mercy from the audience. He also offers to dance a jig for them.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="female">
<persname short="DOLL.">Doll Tearsheet</persname>
<persdescription>Doll Tearsheet is a whore who is a particular favorite of Falstaff&#8217;s. She is drunken and has a remarkably foul mouth. She is fond of Falstaff, or at least makes a good show of it; she is also fond of raging at him. She is arrested and sentenced to be whipped for whoring at the end of the play, though she puts up a good fight (at least in words) against the beadles come to take her. She displeases Hostess Quickly by ending up pregnant, and is accused of having helped Pistol beat a man who later died of his injuries. She is quite good-looking, as common harlots go.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="female">
<persname short="HOST.">Hostess Quickly</persname>
<persdescription>Hostess Quickly (often known as &#8216;Mistress Quickly&#8217;) is the owner of the Boar&#8217;s Head tavern in Eastcheap, and a bit of a madam on the side. She is the same as the Hostess of <persnameref>Henry IV, Part One</persnameref>. She does not have the best command of the English language, and often messes up her words. She is entirely under Falstaff&#8217;s spell, and has known him for 29 years: though he is indebted to her for a massive amount and continually puts of repaying her by promising to marry her instead, the moment he begins to speak to her he is able to convince her to lend him more, even though it may require her to pawn her richest possessions. She is also quick to offer Doll Tearsheet&#8217;s services to the fat knight. Despite her trade, the Hostess wishes to be seen as a respectable woman, and dislikes rowdy customers like Pistol. She is rather dithering, and sent all of a flutter whenever the Prince of Wales shows up in her inn. She is well-able to insult when need be, and is not pleased when Doll ends up pregnant, as it will hurt trade. She is arrested at the end of the play; her further adventures can be found in <persnameref>Henry V</persnameref>.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="female">
<persname short="LADY P.">Lady Percy</persname>
<persdescription>Lady Percy is the widow of Hotspur, the daughter-in-law of the Earl of Northumberland and his Lady. She grieves deeply for her husband, and convinces her father-in-law not to join immediately with the new rebellion but to wait and see how things turn out, not wishing to lose him as well as her husband. She has the courage to use his own desertion from the first rebellion against him. She is the same as the Lady Percy of <persnameref>Henry IV, Part One</persnameref>.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="female">
<persname short="LADY N.">Lady Northumberland</persname>
<persdescription>Lady Northumberland is the Earl of Northumberland&#8217;s wife. Grieving for the death of her son Hotspur, she helps her daughter-in-law persuade her husband to not join the rebellion, recommending Scotland as a good vantage-point from which to observe events.</persdescription>

<persname short="MOUL.">Mouldy</persname>
<persdescription>Mouldy is a countryman drafted to the King&#8217;s army. He is not the brightest of fellows, but while he cannot catch one of Falstaff&#8217;s jokes, he is intelligent enough to know that bribery can get him out of going to war. He takes care of his mother.</persdescription>

<persdescription>Shallow is a Justice of the Peace, an old, thin, decaying man verging on senility, at least 70 years old. He is close to Justice Silence, to whose daughter he is godfather. A great babbler, he is rarely quiet, and is forever remembering his days in university &#8212; or at least telling tales about his days in university. He has known Falstaff since that time, when he was a starving student. Now rich, he looks forward to the possibility of using Falstaff as a connection to court. He is nevertheless deeply involved in his country living, looking into the smallest details of the local life. He thinks himself much more wicked than he is, not realizing that in terms of drinking he is entirely out of his depth with Falstaff and his cronies. He is an honest and loyal servant of the King, not catching on to why Falstaff allows the two best men he drafts to go free. He lends Falstaff the enormous sum of a thousand pounds on expectation of getting it back when Prince Harry becomes King, so certain is Falstaff of the Prince&#8217;s favor. He follows the fat knight to Harry&#8217;s coronation, swept away by promises of lordship and who knows what else, and ends up arrested and sent to the Fleet prison.</persdescription>

<speaker>RUM.</speaker>
<line>Open your ears; for which of you will stop</line>
<line>The vent of hearing when loud Rumor speaks?</line>
<line>I, from the orient to the drooping west</line>
<line>(Making the wind my post-horse), still unfold</line>
<line>The acts commenced on this ball of earth.</line>
<line>Upon my tongues continual slanders ride,</line>
<line>The which in every language I pronounce,</line>
<line>Stuffing the ears of men with false reports.</line>
<line>I speak of peace, while covert enmity</line>
<line>Under the smile of safety wounds the world;</line>
<line>And who but Rumor, who but only I,</line>
<line>Make fearful musters and prepar&#8217;d defense,</line>
<line>Whiles the big year, swoll&#8217;n with some other grief,</line>
<line>Is thought with child by the stern tyrant war,</line>
<line>And no such matter? Rumor is a pipe</line>
<line>Blown by surmises, jealousies, conjectures,</line>
<line>And of so easy and so plain a stop</line>
<line>That the blunt monster with uncounted heads,</line>
<line>The still-discordant wav&#8217;ring multitude,</line>
<line>Can play upon it. But what need I thus</line>
<line>My well-known body to anatomize</line>
<line>Among my household? Why is Rumor here?</line>
<line>I run before King Harry&#8217;s victory,</line>
<line>Who in a bloody field by Shrewsbury</line>
<line>Hath beaten down young Hotspur and his troops,</line>
<line>Quenching the flame of bold rebellion</line>
<line>Even with the rebels&#8217; blood. But what mean I</line>
<line>To speak so true at first? My office is</line>
<line>To noise abroad that Harry Monmouth fell</line>
<line>Under the wrath of noble Hotspur&#8217;s sword,</line>
<line>And that the King before the Douglas&#8217; rage</line>
<line>Stoop&#8217;d his anointed head as low as death.</line>
<line>This have I rumor&#8217;d through the peasant towns</line>
<line>Between that royal field of Shrewsbury</line>
<line>And this worm-eaten hold of ragged stone,</line>
<line>Where Hotspur&#8217;s father, old Northumberland,</line>
<line>Lies crafty-sick. The posts come tiring on,</line>
<line>And not a man of them brings other news</line>
<line>Than they have learnt of me. From Rumor&#8217;s tongues</line>

<line>My lord, Sir John Umfrevile turn&#8217;d me back</line>
<line>With joyful tidings, and being better hors&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Outrode me. After him came spurring hard</line>
<line>A gentleman, almost forespent with speed,</line>
<line>That stopp&#8217;d by me to breathe his bloodied horse.</line>
<line>He ask&#8217;d the way to Chester, and of him</line>
<line>I did demand what news from Shrewsbury.</line>
<line>He told me that rebellion had bad luck,</line>
<line>And that young Harry Percy&#8217;s spur was cold.</line>
<line>With that he gave his able horse the head,</line>
<line>And bending forward strook his armed heels</line>
<line>Against the panting sides of his poor jade</line>
<line>Up to the rowel-head, and starting so</line>
<line>He seem&#8217;d in running to devour the way,</line>
<line>Staying no longer question.</line>

<line offset="6">Ha? Again.</line>

<line>If my young lord your son have not the day,</line>
<line>Upon mine honor, for a silken point</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll give my barony. Never talk of it.</line>

<line>He was some hilding fellow that had stol&#8217;n</line>

<stagedir type="enter">Enter Morton.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>NORTH.</speaker>
<line>Yea, this man&#8217;s brow, like to a title-leaf,</line>

<line>Say, Morton, didst thou come from Shrewsbury?</line>

<speech>

<speaker>NORTH.</speaker>
<line offset="4">How doth my son and brother?</line>
<line>Thou tremblest, and the whiteness in thy cheek</line>
<line>Is apter than thy tongue to tell thy arrand.</line>
<line>Even such a man, so faint, so spiritless,</line>
<line>So dull, so dead in look, so woe-begone,</line>
<line>Drew Priam&#8217;s curtain in the dead of night,</line>
<line>And would have told him half his Troy was burnt;</line>
<line>But Priam found the fire ere he his tongue,</line>
<line>And I my Percy&#8217;s death ere thou report&#8217;st it.</line>
<line>This thou wouldst say, &#8220;Your son did thus and thus;</line>
<line>Your brother thus; so fought the noble Douglas&#8221;&#8212;</line>
<line>Stopping my greedy ear with their bold deeds,</line>
<line>But in the end, to stop my ear indeed,</line>
<line>Thou hast a sigh to blow away this praise,</line>
<line>Ending with &#8220;Brother, son, and all are dead.&#8221;</line>

<speaker>NORTH.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Why, he is dead.</line>
<line>See what a ready tongue suspicion hath!</line>
<line>He that but fears the thing he would not know</line>
<line>Hath by instinct knowledge from others&#8217; eyes</line>
<line>That what he fear&#8217;d is chanced. Yet speak, Morton,</line>

<line>You are too great to be by me gainsaid,</line>
  <line>Your spirit is too true, your fears too certain.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NORTH.</speaker>
<line>Yet for all this, say not that Percy&#8217;s dead.</line>
<line>I see a strange confession in thine eye.</line>
<line>Thou shak&#8217;st thy head, and hold&#8217;st it fear or sin</line>
<line>To speak a truth. If he be slain, say so;</line>
<line>The tongue offends not that reports his death,</line>
<line>And he doth sin that doth belie the dead,</line>
<line>Not he which says the dead is not alive.</line>
<line>Yet the first bringer of unwelcome news</line>
<line>Hath but a losing office, and his tongue</line>
<line>Sounds ever after as a sullen bell,</line>
<line>Rememb&#8217;red tolling a departing friend.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>L. BARD.</speaker>
<line>I cannot think, my lord, your son is dead.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MOR.</speaker>
<line>I am sorry I should force you to believe</line>
<line>That which I would to God I had not seen,</line>
<line>But these mine eyes saw him in bloody state,</line>
<line>Rend&#8217;ring faint quittance, wearied and outbreath&#8217;d,</line>
<line>To Harry Monmouth, whose swift wrath beat down</line>
<line>The never-daunted Percy to the earth,</line>
<line>From whence with life he never more sprung up.</line>
<line>In few, his death, whose spirit lent a fire</line>
<line>Even to the dullest peasant in his camp,</line>
<line>Being bruited once, took fire and heat away</line>
<line>From the best-temper&#8217;d courage in his troops,</line>
<line>For from his metal was his party steeled,</line>
<line>Which once in him abated, all the rest</line>
<line>Turn&#8217;d on themselves, like dull and heavy lead.</line>
<line>And as the thing that&#8217;s heavy in itself</line>
<line>Upon enforcement flies with greatest speed,</line>
<line>So did our men, heavy in Hotspur&#8217;s loss,</line>
<line>Lend to this weight such lightness with their fear</line>
<line>That arrows fled not swifter toward their aim</line>
<line>Than did our soldiers, aiming at their safety,</line>
<line>Fly from the field. Then was that noble Worcester</line>
<line>So soon ta&#8217;en prisoner, and that furious Scot,</line>
<line>The bloody Douglas, whose well-laboring sword</line>
<line>Had three times slain th&#8217; appearance of the King,</line>
<line>Gan vail his stomach and did grace the shame</line>
<line>Of those that turn&#8217;d their backs, and in his flight,</line>
<line>Stumbling in fear, was took. The sum of all</line>
<line>Is that the King hath won, and hath sent out</line>
<line>A speedy power to encounter you, my lord,</line>
<line>Under the conduct of young Lancaster</line>
<line>And Westmorland. This is the news at full.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NORTH.</speaker>
<line>For this I shall have time enough to mourn;</line>
<line>In poison there is physic, and these news,</line>
<line>Having been well, that would have made me sick,</line>
<line>Being sick, have (in some measure) made me well.</line>
<line>And as the wretch whose fever-weak&#8217;ned joints,</line>
<line>Like strengthless hinges, buckle under life,</line>
<line>Impatient of his fit, breaks like a fire</line>
<line>Out of his keeper&#8217;s arms, even so my limbs,</line>
<line>Weak&#8217;ned with grief, being now enrag&#8217;d with grief,</line>
<line>Are thrice themselves. Hence therefore, thou nice crutch!</line>
<line>A scaly gauntlet now with joints of steel</line>
<line>Must glove this hand; and hence, thou sickly coif!</line>
<line>That art a guard too wanton for the head</line>
<line>Which princes, flesh&#8217;d with conquest, aim to hit.</line>
<line>Now bind my brows with iron, and approach</line>
<line>The ragged&#8217;st hour that time and spite dare bring</line>
<line>To frown upon th&#8217; enrag&#8217;d Northumberland!</line>
<line>Let heaven kiss earth! Now let not Nature&#8217;s hand</line>
<line>Keep the wild flood confin&#8217;d! Let order die!</line>
<line>And let this world no longer be a stage</line>
<line>To feed contention in a ling&#8217;ring act;</line>
<line>But let one spirit of the first-born Cain</line>
<line>Reign in all bosoms, that each heart being set</line>
<line>On bloody courses, the rude scene may end,</line>

<line>Lean on your health, the which, if you give o&#8217;er</line>

<line>You cast th&#8217; event of war, my noble lord,</line>
<line>And summ&#8217;d the accompt of chance before you said,</line>
<line>&#8220;Let us make head.&#8221; It was your presurmise</line>

<line>You knew he walk&#8217;d o&#8217;er perils, on an edge,</line>
<line>More likely to fall in than to get o&#8217;er;</line>
<line>You were advis&#8217;d his flesh was capable</line>

<line>Yet did you say, &#8220;Go forth!&#8221; and none of this</line>
<line>(Though strongly apprehended) could restrain</line>

<line>Chok&#8217;d the respect of likely peril fear&#8217;d,</line>

<line>Who with a double surety binds his followers.</line>
<line>My lord your son had only but the corpse&#8217;,</line>
<line>But shadows and the shows of men, to fight;</line>
<line>For that same word, rebellion, did divide</line>
<line>The action of their bodies from their souls,</line>
<line>And they did fight with queasiness, constrain&#8217;d</line>
<line>As men drink potions, that their weapons only</line>
<line>Seem&#8217;d on our side; but for their spirits and souls,</line>
<line>This word, rebellion, it had froze them up,</line>
<line>As fish are in a pond. But now the Bishop</line>
<line>Turns insurrection to religion.</line>
<line>Suppos&#8217;d sincere and holy in his thoughts,</line>
<line>He&#8217;s follow&#8217;d both with body and with mind;</line>

<line>Derives from heaven his quarrel and his cause;</line>

<speaker>FAL.</speaker>
<line>My good lord! God give your lordship good time of day. I am glad to see your lordship abroad. I heard say your lordship was sick, I hope your lordship goes abroad by advice. Your lordship, though not clean past your youth, have yet some smack of an ague in you, some relish of the saltness of time in you, and I most humbly beseech your lordship to have a reverend care of your health.</line>
</speech>

<speech>

<line>Sir John, I sent for you before your expedition to Shrewsbury.</line>

<line>I talk not of his Majesty. You would not come when I sent for you.</line>
</speech>

<line>Well, God mend him! I pray you let me speak with you.</line>

<line>This apoplexy, as I take it, is a kind of lethargy, and&#8217;t please your lordship, a kind of sleeping in the blood, a whoreson tingling.</line>

<speaker>CH. JUST.</speaker>
<line>To punish you by the heels would amend the attention of your ears, and I care not if I do become your physician.</line>

<line>I am as poor as Job, my lord, but not so patient. Your lordship may minister the potion of imprisonment to me in respect of poverty, but how I should be your patient to follow your prescriptions, the wise may make some dram of a scruple, or indeed a scruple itself.</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CH. JUST.</speaker>
<line>Well, I am loath to gall a new-heal&#8217;d wound. Your day&#8217;s service at Shrewsbury hath a little gilded over your night&#8217;s exploit on Gadshill. You may thank th&#8217; unquiet time for your quiet o&#8217;erposting that action.</line>

<line>What, you are as a candle, the better part burnt out.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>FAL.</speaker>
<line>Not so, my lord. Your ill angel is light, but I hope he that looks upon me will take me without weighing, and yet in some respects I grant I cannot go. I cannot tell. Virtue is of so little regard in these costermongers&#8217; times that true valor is turn&#8217;d berrord; pregnancy is made a tapster, and his quick wit wasted in giving reckonings; all the other gifts appertinent to man, as the malice of this age shapes them, are not worth a gooseberry. You that are old consider not the capacities of us that are young, you do measure the heat of our livers with the bitterness of your galls; and we that are in the vaward of our youth, I must confess, are wags too.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CH. JUST.</speaker>
<line>Do you set down your name in the scroll of youth, that are written down old with all the characters of age? Have you not a moist eye, a dry hand, a yellow cheek, a white beard, a decreasing leg, an increasing belly? Is not your voice broken, your wind short, your chin double, your wit single, and every part about you blasted with antiquity? And will you yet call yourself young? Fie, fie, fie, Sir John!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FAL.</speaker>
<line>My lord, I was born about three of the clock in the afternoon, with a white head and something a round belly. For my voice, I have lost it with hallowing and singing of anthems. To approve my youth further, I will not. The truth is, I am only old in judgment and understanding; and he that will caper with me for a thousand marks, let him lend me the money, and have at him! For the box of the year that the Prince gave you, he gave it like a rude prince, and you took it like a sensible lord. I have check&#8217;d him for it, and the young lion repents,</line>

<line>Well, the King hath sever&#8217;d you. I hear you are going with Lord John of Lancaster against the Archbishop and the Earl of Northumberland.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FAL.</speaker>
<line>Yea, I thank your pretty sweet wit for it. But look you pray, all you that kiss my Lady Peace at home, that our armies join not in a hot day! For, by the Lord, I take but two shirts out with me, and I mean not to sweat extraordinarily. If it be a hot day, and I brandish any thing but a bottle, I would I might never spit white again. There is not a dangerous action can peep out his head but I am thrust upon it. Well, I cannot last ever, but it was alway yet the trick of our English nation, if they have a good thing, to make it too common. If ye will needs say I am an old man, you should give me rest. I would to God my name were not so terrible to the enemy as it is. I were better to be eaten to death with a rust than to be scour&#8217;d to nothing with perpetual motion.</line>

<line>Yes, if this present quality of war&#8212;</line>

A hundred mark is a long one for a poor lone woman to bear, and I have borne, and borne, and borne, and have been fubb&#8217;d off, and fubb&#8217;d off, and fubb&#8217;d off, from this day to that day, that it is a shame to be thought on. There is no honesty in such dealing, unless a woman should be made an ass and a beast, to bear every knave&#8217;s wrong.</line>

Thou didst swear to me upon a parcel-gilt goblet, sitting in my Dauphin chamber, at the round table by a sea-coal fire, upon Wednesday in Wheeson week, when the Prince broke thy head for liking his father to a singing-man of Windsor, thou didst swear to me then, as I was washing thy wound, to marry me and make me my lady thy wife. Canst thou deny it? Did not goodwife Keech, the butcher&#8217;s wife, come in then and call me gossip Quickly? Coming in to borrow a mess of vinegar, telling us she had a good dish of prawns, whereby thou didst desire to eat some, whereby I told thee they were ill for a green wound? And didst thou not, when she was gone down stairs, desire me to be no more so familiarity with such poor people, saying that ere long they should call me madam?

<speech>
<speaker>PRINCE.</speaker>
<line>Before God, I am exceeding weary.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POINS.</speaker>
<line>Is&#8217;t come to that? I had thought weariness durst not have attach&#8217;d one of so high blood.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRINCE.</speaker>
<line>Faith, it does me, though it discolors the complexion of my greatness to acknowledge it. Doth it not show vildly in me to desire small beer?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POINS.</speaker>
<line>Why, a prince should not be so loosely studied as to remember so weak a composition.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRINCE.</speaker>
<line>Belike then my appetite was not princely got, for, by my troth, I do now remember the poor creature, small beer. But indeed these humble considerations make me out of love with my greatness. What a disgrace is it to me to remember thy name, or to know thy face tomorrow, or to take note how many pair of silk stockings thou hast, viz., these, and those that were thy peach-color&#8217;d once, or to bear the inventory of thy shirts, as one for superfluity, and another for use! But that the tennis-court-keeper knows better than I, for it is a low ebb of linen with thee when thou keepest not racket there; as thou hast not done a great while, because the rest of the low countries have made a shift to eat up thy holland. And God knows whether those that bawl out the ruins of thy linen shall inherit his kingdom: but the midwives say the children are not in the fault, whereupon the world increases, and kinreds are mightily strengthen&#8217;d.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POINS.</speaker>
<line>How ill it follows, after you have labor&#8217;d so hard, you should talk so idlely! Tell me how many good young princes would do so, their fathers being so sick as yours at this time is.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRINCE.</speaker>
<line>Shall I tell thee one thing, Poins?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POINS.</speaker>
<line>Yes, faith, and let it be an excellent good thing.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRINCE.</speaker>
<line>It shall serve among wits of no higher breeding than thine.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POINS.</speaker>
<line>Go to, I stand the push of your one thing that you will tell.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRINCE.</speaker>
<line>Marry, I tell thee it is not meet that I should be sad, now my father is sick, albeit I could tell to thee&#8212;as to one it pleases me, for fault of a better, to call my friend&#8212;I could be sad, and sad indeed too.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POINS.</speaker>
<line>Very hardly, upon such a subject.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRINCE.</speaker>
<line>By this hand, thou thinkest me as far in the devil&#8217;s book as thou and Falstaff, for obduracy and persistency. Let the end try the man. But I tell thee, my heart bleeds inwardly that my father is so sick, and keeping such vile company as thou art hath in reason taken from me all ostentation of sorrow.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POINS.</speaker>
<line>The reason?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRINCE.</speaker>
<line>What wouldst thou think of me if I should weep?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POINS.</speaker>
<line>I would think thee a most princely hypocrite.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRINCE.</speaker>
<line>It would be every man&#8217;s thought, and thou art a blessed fellow to think as every man thinks. Never a man&#8217;s thought in the world keeps the road-way better than thine: every man would think me an hypocrite indeed. And what accites your most worshipful thought to think so?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POINS.</speaker>
<line>Why, because you have been so lewd and so much engraff&#8217;d to Falstaff.</line>

<speaker>PRINCE.</speaker>
<line>And to thee.</line>
</speech>

<speaker>POINS.</speaker>
<line>By this light, I am well spoke on, I can hear it with mine own ears. The worst that they can say of me is that I am a second brother, and that I am a proper fellow of my hands, and those two things I confess I cannot help. By the mass, here comes Bardolph.</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAGE.</speaker>
<line>&#8217;A calls me e&#8217;en now, my lord, through a red lattice, and I could discern no part of his face from the window. At last I spied his eyes, and methought he had made two holes in the ale-wive&#8217;s petticoat and so peep&#8217;d through.</line>

<line>When your own Percy, when my heart&#8217;s dear Harry,</line>
<line>Threw many a northward look to see his father</line>
<line>Bring up his powers; but he did long in vain.</line>
<line>Who then persuaded you to stay at home?</line>
<line>There were two honors lost, yours and your son&#8217;s:</line>
<line>For yours, the God of heaven brighten it!</line>
<line>For his, it stuck upon him as the sun</line>
<line>In the grey vault of heaven, and by his light</line>
<line>Did all the chevalry of England move</line>
<line>To do brave acts. He was indeed the glass</line>
<line>Wherein the noble youth did dress themselves:</line>
<line>He had no legs that practic&#8217;d not his gait;</line>
<line>And speaking thick (which nature made his blemish)</line>
<line>Became the accents of the valiant;</line>
<line>For those that could speak low and tardily</line>
<line>Would turn their own perfection to abuse</line>
<line>To seem like him; so that in speech, in gait,</line>
<line>In diet, in affections of delight,</line>
<line>In military rules, humors of blood,</line>
<line>He was the mark and glass, copy and book,</line>
<line>That fashion&#8217;d others. And him, O wondrous him!</line>
<line>O miracle of men! Him did you leave,</line>
<line>Second to none, unseconded by you,</line>
<line>To look upon the hideous god of war</line>
<line>In disadvantage, to abide a field</line>
<line>Where nothing but the sound of Hotspur&#8217;s name</line>
<line>Did seem defensible: so you left him.</line>
<line>Never, O never, do his ghost the wrong</line>

<scenedescription>The waiters at the inn prepare the room for Falstaff&#8217;s dessert, and agree to let the Prince and Poins take their places. Mistress Quickly brings in Doll Tearsheet, who has had too much to drink. Falstaff comes in, and he and Doll insult each other roundly, though the whore is saddened to see him leave for the wars. The braggart Pistol comes in, swaggering until Falstaff beats him out of doors. Poins and the Prince overhear as Falstaff badmouths both of them to Doll. She tries to cheer him up as he begins to feel his age. Hal and Poins reveal themselves and accuse him over what he has said, and he makes a valiant effort to talk himself out of trouble. Peto brings a command for the Prince to join his father, and Hal instantly sobers up; Falstaff, in the meantime, is sought out by a dozen captains, though after his farewells to the ladies he takes the time for a last tryst with Doll.</scenedescription>

<speech>
<speaker>DOLL.</speaker>
<line>Why does the Prince love him so then?</line>

<speaker>FAL.</speaker>
<line>Because their legs are both of a bigness, and &#8217;a plays at quoits well, and eats conger and fennel, and drinks off candles&#8217; ends for flap-dragons, and rides the wild-mare with the boys, and jumps upon join&#8217;d-stools, and swears with a good grace, and wears his boots very smooth, like unto the sign of the Leg, and breeds no bate with telling of discreet stories; and such other gambol faculties &#8217;a has, that show a weak mind and an able body, for the which the Prince admits him. For the Prince himself is such another, the weight of a hair will turn scales between their avoirdupois.</line>

<scenedescription>The King is suffering from insomnia, unable to shake his cares and the cares of kingship from himself. He recollects his usurpation of the throne, considering how men once friends can fall out over little things and end up dreadful enemies. Warwick assures the King that the rumor of 50,000 rebels is false, and promises the King that the situation is better than it looks, as Glendower has been killed. He begs the King to take some sleep, as his odd waking hours cannot help his illness. Henry agrees, still dreaming of his crusade to the Holy Land.</scenedescription>

The fat knight arrives to recruit soldiers with Justice Shallow&#8217;s help. He chooses the four most ragged soldier, as the two best choices bribe Bardolph to get them out of serving.

<speech>
<speaker>SHAL.</speaker>
<line>I am Robert Shallow, sir, a poor esquire of this county, and one of the King&#8217;s justices of the peace. What is your good pleasure with me?</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SHAL.</speaker>
<line>He greets me well, sir. I knew him a good backsword man. How doth the good knight? May I ask how my lady his wife doth?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BARD.</speaker>
<line>Sir, pardon, a soldier is better accommodated than with a wife.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SHAL.</speaker>
<line>It is well said, in faith, sir, and it is well said indeed too. Better accommodated! It is good, yea indeed is it. Good phrases are surely, and ever were, very commendable. Accommodated! It comes of accommodo, very good, a good phrase.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BARD.</speaker>
<line>Pardon, sir, I have heard the word. Phrase call you it? By this day, I know not the phrase, but I will maintain the word with my sword to be a soldier-like word, and a word of exceeding good command, by heaven. Accommodated: that is, when a man is, as they say, accommodated, or when a man is being whereby &#8217;a may be thought to be accommodated&#8212;which is an excellent thing.</line>

<line>My mother&#8217;s son, sir.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FAL.</speaker>
<line>Thy mother&#8217;s son! Like enough, and thy father&#8217;s shadow. So the son of the female is the shadow of the male. It is often so indeed, but much of the father&#8217;s substance!</line>

<line>Thou art a very ragged wart.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SHAL.</speaker>
<line>Shall I prick him, Sir John?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FAL.</speaker>
<line>It were superfluous, for &#8217;s apparel is built upon his back, and the whole frame stands upon pins. Prick him no more.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SHAL.</speaker>
<line>Ha, ha, ha! You can do it, sir, you can do it, I commend you well. Francis Feeble!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FEE.</speaker>
<line>Here, sir.</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SHAL.</speaker>
<line>Shall I prick him, sir?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FAL.</speaker>
<line>You may, but if he had been a man&#8217;s tailor, he&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; prick&#8217;d you. Wilt thou make as many holes in an enemy&#8217;s battle as thou hast done in a woman&#8217;s petticoat?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FEE.</speaker>
<line>I will do my good will, sir, you can have no more.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FAL.</speaker>
<line>Well said, good woman&#8217;s tailor! Well said, courageous Feeble! Thou wilt be as valiant as the wrathful dove or most magnanimous mouse. Prick the woman&#8217;s tailor. Well, Master Shallow, deep, Master Shallow.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FEE.</speaker>
<line>I would Wart might have gone, sir.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FAL.</speaker>
<line>I would thou wert a man&#8217;s tailor, that thou mightst mend him and make him fit to go. I cannot put him to a private soldier that is the leader of so many thousands. Let that suffice, most forcible Feeble.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FEE.</speaker>
<line>It shall suffice, sir.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FAL.</speaker>

<line>Come, thou shalt go to the wars in a gown. We will have away thy cold, and I will take such order that thy friends shall ring for thee. Is here all?</line>

<speaker>FAL.</speaker>
<line>Come, I will go drink with you, but I cannot tarry dinner. I am glad to see you, by my troth, Master Shallow.</line>

<line>No more of that, Master Shallow, no more of that.</line>

<line>Ha, &#8217;twas a merry night. And is Jane Nightwork alive?</line>

<line>Never, never, she would always say she could not abide Master Shallow.</line>

<line>Will you tell me, Master Shallow, how to choose a man? Care I for the limb, the thews, the stature, bulk, and big assemblance of a man? Give me the spirit, Master Shallow. Here&#8217;s Wart, you see what a ragged appearance it is. &#8217;A shall charge you and discharge you with the motion of a pewterer&#8217;s hammer, come off and on swifter than he that gibbets on the brewer&#8217;s bucket. And this same half-fac&#8217;d fellow, Shadow, give me this man. He presents no mark to the enemy, the foeman may with as great aim level at the edge of a penknife. And for a retrait, how swiftly will this Feeble the woman&#8217;s tailor run off! O, give me the spare men, and spare me the great ones. Put me a caliver into Wart&#8217;s hand, Bardolph.</line>

<line>As I return, I will fetch off these justices. I do see the bottom of Justice Shallow. Lord, Lord, how subject we old men are to this vice of lying! This same starv&#8217;d justice hath done nothing but prate to me of the wildness of his youth, and the feats he hath done about Turnbull Street, and every third word a lie, duer paid to the hearer than the Turk&#8217;s tribute. I do remember him at Clement&#8217;s Inn, like a man made after supper of a cheese-paring. When &#8217;a was naked, he was for all the world like a fork&#8217;d redish, with a head fantastically carv&#8217;d upon it with a knife. &#8217;A was so forlorn, that his dimensions to any thick sight were invisible. &#8217;A was the very genius of famine, yet lecherous as a monkey, and the whores call&#8217;d him mandrake. &#8217;A came ever in the rearward of the fashion, and sung those tunes to the overscutch&#8217;d huswives that he heard the carmen whistle, and sware they were his fancies or his good-nights. And now is this Vice&#8217;s dagger become a squire, and talks as familiarly of John a&#8217; Gaunt as if he had been sworn brother to him, and I&#8217;ll be sworn &#8217;a ne&#8217;er saw him but once in the Tilt-yard, and then he burst his head for crowding among the marshal&#8217;s men. I saw it, and told John a&#8217; Gaunt he beat his own name, for you might have thrust him and all his apparel into an eel-skin. The case of a treble hoboy was a mansion for him, a court, and now has he land and beefs! Well, I&#8217;ll be acquainted with him if I return, and&#8217;t shall go hard but I&#8217;ll make him a philosopher&#8217;s two stones to me. If the young dace be a bait for the old pike, I see no reason in the law of nature but I may snap at him: let time shape, and there an end.</line>

<scenepersonae>(Archbishop of York, Mowbray, Lord Bardolph, Hastings, Messenger, Westmorland, Prince John)</scenepersonae>
<scenedescription>The rebels have received news that Northumberland will not be joining them. Westmoreland comes to them from Prince John of Lancaster, the leader of the royalist forces, and asks them the reasons for their rebellion. The Archbishop lists off a number of grievances, but Westmoreland argues that they are all specious reasons for a revolt. The Archbishop sends him back to Prince John with a written list of the rebels&#8217; complaints; in Westmoreland&#8217;s absence, the rebels confer and are divided over their chances of success. The Archbishop is convincing when he argues that the King is too weak to risk standing up to the rebellion. Westmoreland returns and asks the rebel leaders to come to a parley with Prince John, and they agree.</scenedescription>

<line offset="7">Then, my lord,</line>
<line>Unto your Grace do I in chief address</line>
<line>The substance of my speech. If that rebellion</line>
<line>Came like itself, in base and abject routs,</line>
<line>Led on by bloody youth, guarded with rage,</line>
<line>And countenanc&#8217;d by boys and beggary&#8212;</line>
<line>I say, if damn&#8217;d commotion so appear&#8217;d</line>
<line>In his true, native, and most proper shape,</line>
<line>You, reverend father, and these noble lords</line>
<line>Had not been here to dress the ugly form</line>
<line>Of base and bloody insurrection</line>
<line>With your fair honors. You, Lord Archbishop,</line>
<line>Whose see is by a civil peace maintain&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Whose beard the silver hand of peace hath touch&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Whose learning and good letters peace hath tutor&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Whose white investments figure innocence,</line>
<line>The dove, and very blessed spirit of peace,</line>
<line>Wherefore do you so ill translate yourself</line>
<line>Out of the speech of peace that bears such grace,</line>
<line>Into the harsh and boist&#8217;rous tongue of war?</line>
<line>Turning your books to graves, your ink to blood,</line>
<line>Your pens to lances, and your tongue divine</line>
<line>To a loud trumpet and a point of war?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ARCH.</speaker>
<line>Wherefore do I this? So the question stands.</line>
<line>Briefly, to this end: we are all diseas&#8217;d,</line>
<line>And with our surfeiting and wanton hours</line>
<line>Have brought ourselves into a burning fever,</line>
<line>And we must bleed for it; of which disease</line>
<line>Our late King Richard (being infected) died.</line>
<line>But, my most noble Lord of Westmorland,</line>
<line>I take not on me here as a physician,</line>
<line>Nor do I as an enemy to peace</line>
<line>Troop in the throngs of military men;</line>
<line>But rather show a while like fearful war</line>
<line>To diet rank minds sick of happiness,</line>
<line>And purge th&#8217; obstructions which begin to stop</line>
<line>Our very veins of life. Hear me more plainly.</line>
<line>I have in equal balance justly weigh&#8217;d</line>
<line>What wrongs our arms may do, what wrongs we suffer,</line>
<line>And find our griefs heavier than our offenses.</line>
<line>We see which way the stream of time doth run,</line>
<line>And are enforc&#8217;d from our most quiet there</line>
<line>By the rough torrent of occasion,</line>
<line>And have the summary of all our griefs</line>
<line>(When time shall serve) to show in articles;</line>
<line>Which long ere this we offer&#8217;d to the King,</line>
<line>And might by no suit gain our audience.</line>
<line>When we are wrong&#8217;d and would unfold our griefs,</line>
<line>We are denied access unto his person</line>
<line>Even by those men that most have done us wrong.</line>
<line>The dangers of the days but newly gone,</line>
<line>Whose memory is written on the earth</line>
<line>With yet appearing blood, and the examples</line>
<line>Of every minute&#8217;s instance (present now)</line>
<line>Hath put us in these ill-beseeming arms,</line>
<line>Not to break peace, or any branch of it,</line>
<line>But to establish here a peace indeed,</line>
<line>Concurring both in name and quality.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WEST.</speaker>
<line>When ever yet was your appeal denied?</line>
<line>Wherein have you been galled by the King?</line>
<line>What peer hath been suborn&#8217;d to grate on you?</line>

<line>Of forg&#8217;d rebellion with a seal divine.</line>

<line>Why not to him in part, and to us all</line>

<line offset="4">O, my good Lord Mowbray,</line>
<line>Construe the times to their necessities,</line>

<line>Yet, for your part, it not appears to me,</line>
<line>Either from the King or in the present time,</line>
<line>That you should have an inch of any ground</line>

<line>What thing, in honor, had my father lost,</line>
<line>That need to be reviv&#8217;d and breath&#8217;d in me?</line>
<line>The King that lov&#8217;d him, as the state stood then,</line>
<line>Was force perforce compell&#8217;d to banish him;</line>
<line>And then that Henry Bullingbrook and he,</line>
<line>Being mounted and both roused in their seats,</line>
<line>Their neighing coursers daring of the spur,</line>
<line>Their armed staves in charge, their beavers down,</line>
<line>Their eyes of fire sparkling through sights of steel,</line>
<line>And the loud trumpet blowing them together;</line>
<line>Then, then, when there was nothing could have stay&#8217;d</line>
<line>My father from the breast of Bullingbrook,</line>
<line>O, when the King did throw his warder down</line>
<line>(His own life hung upon the staff he threw),</line>
<line>Then threw he down himself and all their lives</line>
<line>That by indictment and by dint of sword</line>
<line>Have since miscarried under Bullingbrook.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WEST.</speaker>
<line>You speak, Lord Mowbray, now you know not what.</line>
<line>The Earl of Herford was reputed then</line>
<line>In England the most valiant gentleman.</line>
<line>Who knows on whom fortune would then have smil&#8217;d?</line>
<line>But if your father had been victor there,</line>
<line>He ne&#8217;er had borne it out of Coventry;</line>
<line>For all the country in a general voice</line>
<line>Cried hate upon him; and all their prayers and love</line>
<line>Were set on Herford, whom they doted on</line>
<line>And bless&#8217;d and grac&#8217;d and did, more than the King&#8212;</line>
<line>But this is mere digression from my purpose.</line>
<line>Here come I from our princely general</line>
<line>To know your griefs, to tell you from his Grace</line>
<line>That he will give you audience, and wherein</line>
<line>It shall appear that your demands are just,</line>
<line>You shall enjoy them, every thing set off</line>
<line>That might so much as think you enemies.</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WEST.</speaker>
<line>Mowbray, you overween to take it so;</line>
<line>This offer comes from mercy, not from fear.</line>
<line>For lo, within a ken our army lies:</line>
<line>Upon mine honor, all too confident</line>
<line>To give admittance to a thought of fear.</line>
<line>Our battle is more full of names than yours,</line>
<line>Our men more perfect in the use of arms,</line>
<line>Our armor all as strong, our cause the best;</line>
<line>Then reason will our hearts should be as good.</line>
<line>Say you not then our offer is compell&#8217;d.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MOWB.</speaker>
<line>Well, by my will we shall admit no parley.</line>

<line>Fear you not that; if we can make our peace</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ARCH.</speaker>
<line>No, no, my lord, note this: the King is weary</line>
<line>Of dainty and such picking grievances,</line>
<line>For he hath found to end one doubt by death</line>
<line>Revives two greater in the heirs of life;</line>
<line>And therefore will he wipe his tables clean</line>
<line>And keep no tell-tale to his memory</line>
<line>That may repeat and history his loss</line>
<line>To new remembrance; for full well he knows</line>
<line>He cannot so precisely weed this land</line>
<line>As his misdoubts present occasion.</line>
<line>His foes are so enrooted with his friends</line>
<line>That, plucking to unfix an enemy,</line>
<line>He doth unfasten so and shake a friend,</line>
<line>So that this land, like an offensive wife</line>
<line>That hath enrag&#8217;d him on to offer strokes,</line>
<line>As he is striking, holds his infant up</line>
<line>And hangs resolv&#8217;d correction in the arm</line>
<line>That was uprear&#8217;d to execution.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HAST.</speaker>
<line>Besides, the King hath wasted all his rods</line>
<line>On late offenders, that he now doth lack</line>
<line>The very instruments of chastisement,</line>
<line>So that his power, like to a fangless lion,</line>
<line>May offer, but not hold.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ARCH.</speaker>
<line offset="5">&#8217;Tis very true,</line>

<scenedescription>Lancaster rebukes the Archbishop for taking up arms against the King, God&#8217;s representative on earth, but the prelate protests that he is warring not against the King but against the injustices of the time. Prince John agrees to present their protests to the King, claiming that some of his laws have been misunderstood and misapplied, and suggests that both sides dismiss their armies. The rebel army disbands first, and scatters, while the royalist forces stay in rank. Once he is certain that the rebel forces pose no more danger, Lancaster arrests all the rebel leaders, pointing out that he never promised them their safety, only that their complaints would be heard. The royal army chases after the rebels.</scenedescription>

<line>I would be sorry, my lord, but it should be thus. I never knew yet but rebuke and check was the reward of valor. Do you think me a swallow, an arrow, or a bullet?

But what of that? He saw me, and yielded, that I may justly say, with the hook-nos&#8217;d fellow of Rome, &#8220;There, cousin, I came, saw, and overcame.&#8221;</line>

<line>I would you had the wit, &#8217;twere better than your dukedom. Good faith, this same young sober-blooded boy doth not love me, nor a man cannot make him laugh, but that&#8217;s no marvel, he drinks no wine. There&#8217;s never none of these demure boys come to any proof, for thin drink doth so over-cool their blood, and making many fish-meals, that they fall into a kind of male green-sickness, and then when they marry, they get wenches. They are generally fools and cowards, which some of us should be too, but for inflammation. A good sherris-sack hath a twofold operation in it. It ascends me into the brain, dries me there all the foolish and dull and crudy vapors which environ it, makes it apprehensive, quick, forgetive, full of nimble, fiery, and delectable shapes, which deliver&#8217;d o&#8217;er to the voice, the tongue, which is the birth, becomes excellent wit. The second property of your excellent sherris is the warming of the blood, which before (cold and settled) left the liver white and pale, which is the badge of pusillanimity and cowardice; but the sherris warms it, and makes it course from the inwards to the parts&#8217; extremes. It illumineth the face, which as a beacon gives warning to all the rest of this little kingdom, man, to arm, and then the vital commoners and inland petty spirits muster me all to their captain, the heart, who great and puff&#8217;d up with this retinue, doth any deed of courage; and this valor comes of sherris. So that skill in the weapon is nothing without sack (for that sets it a-work) and learning a mere hoard of gold kept by a devil, till sack commences it and sets it in act and use. Hereof comes it that Prince Harry is valiant, for the cold blood he did naturally inherit of his father, he hath, like lean, sterile, and bare land, manur&#8217;d, husbanded, and till&#8217;d with excellent endeavor of drinking good and good store of fertile sherris, that he is become very hot and valiant. If I had a thousand sons, the first humane principle I would teach them should be, to forswear thin potations and to addict themselves to sack.</line>

<scenedescription>The King is ready for his crusade, except that he is too weak to leave at present. Worried about Hal&#8217;s dissipation, he begs his son Thomas, Duke of Clarence, to exert his good influence on the oldest son, as the latter likes Clarence better than his other siblings. Henry bewails Hal&#8217;s attraction to unworthy companions, but Warwick insists the Prince is simply studying them. Westmoreland brings the news of the rebels&#8217; defeat, and further news arrives of Northumberland and Lord Bardolph&#8217;s defeat by the sheriff of Yorkshire. Though overjoyed, the King suffers a fit of his illness. The King&#8217;s sons realize that he is dying.</scenedescription>

<line>Nothing but well to thee, Thomas of Clarence.</line>
<line>How chance thou art not with the Prince thy brother?</line>
<line>He loves thee, and thou dost neglect him, Thomas.</line>
<line>Thou hast a better place in his affection</line>

<line>Therefore omit him not, blunt not his love,</line>
<line>Nor lose the good advantage of his grace</line>
<line>By seeming cold or careless of his will,</line>

<line>He hath a tear for pity, and a hand</line>
<line>Open as day for meting charity;</line>
<line>Yet notwithstanding, being incens&#8217;d, he is flint,</line>
<line>As humorous as winter, and as sudden</line>

<line>Chide him for faults, and do it reverently,</line>

<line>But, being moody, give him time and scope,</line>

<scenedescription>The King lies down to rest, commanding silence and insisting that the crown be laid next to him. Hal arrives, and offers to sit by his father&#8217;s bedside. Left alone, he wonders at the presence of the crown. The King&#8217;s sleep is so profound that Hal is convinced he is dead; the Prince picks up the crown and puts it on his head, and leaves. The King awakes and bursts into a rage, convinced that Hal wants him dead and bemoaning the fate awaiting the kingdom under such a feckless ruler. Hal, who has been weeping for his father, is faced with the man attacking him with a fearsome tirade accusing him of being a bad son and likely to be a worse King. Hal defends himself, pleading that he truly believed Henry to be dead and took the crown to come to terms with having to wear it. The King is moved, and forgives Hal before offering him advice, particularly suggesting that he go to war abroad to keep the nobles too occupied to rebel. The others return, and the King asks whether the chamber where he swooned has a name; learning that it is called the Jerusalem chamber, he realizes that the prophecy that he should die in Jerusalem did not mean that he would ever make it on crusade. He asks to be taken to the chamber to die.</scenedescription>

<speech>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<line>Thy wish was father, Harry, to that thought:</line>
<line>I stay too long by thee, I weary thee.</line>
<line>Dost thou so hunger for mine empty chair</line>
<line>That thou wilt needs invest thee with my honors</line>
<line>Before thy hour be ripe? O foolish youth,</line>
<line>Thou seek&#8217;st the greatness that will overwhelm thee.</line>
<line>Stay but a little, for my cloud of dignity</line>
<line>Is held from falling with so weak a wind</line>
<line>That it will quickly drop; my day is dim.</line>
<line>Thou hast stol&#8217;n that which after some few hours</line>
<line>Were thine without offense, and at my death</line>
<line>Thou hast seal&#8217;d up my expectation.</line>
<line>Thy life did manifest thou lov&#8217;dst me not,</line>
<line>And thou wilt have me die assur&#8217;d of it.</line>
<line>Thou hid&#8217;st a thousand daggers in thy thoughts,</line>
<line>Whom thou hast whetted on thy stony heart</line>
<line>To stab at half an hour of my life.</line>
<line>What, canst thou not forbear me half an hour?</line>
<line>Then get thee gone, and dig my grave thyself,</line>
<line>And bid the merry bells ring to thine ear</line>
<line>That thou art crowned, not that I am dead.</line>
<line>Let all the tears that should bedew my hearse</line>
<line>Be drops of balm to sanctify thy head;</line>
<line>Only compound me with forgotten dust;</line>
<line>Give that which gave thee life unto the worms,</line>
<line>Pluck down my officers, break my decrees,</line>
<line>For now a time is come to mock at form.</line>
<line>Harry the Fifth is crown&#8217;d! Up, vanity!</line>
<line>Down, royal state! All you sage counsellors, hence!</line>
<line>And to the English court assemble now,</line>
<line>From every region, apes of idleness!</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRINCE.</speaker>
<line>O, pardon me, my liege! But for my tears,</line>
<line>The moist impediments unto my speech,</line>
<line>I had forestall&#8217;d this dear and deep rebuke</line>
<line>Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard</line>
<line>The course of it so far. There is your crown;</line>
<line>And He that wears the crown immortally</line>
<line>Long guard it yours! If I affect it more</line>
<line>Than as your honor and as your renown,</line>
<line>Let me no more from this obedience rise,</line>

<stagedir type="action">Kneels.</stagedir>
<line>Which my most inward true and duteous spirit</line>
<line>Teacheth this prostrate and exterior bending.</line>
<line>God witness with me, when I here came in,</line>
<line>And found no course of breath within your Majesty,</line>
<line>How cold it strook my heart! If I do feign,</line>
<line>O, let me in my present wildness die,</line>
<line>And never live to show th&#8217; incredulous world</line>
<line>The noble change that I have purposed!</line>
<line>Coming to look on you, thinking you dead,</line>
<line>And dead almost, my liege, to think you were,</line>
<line>I spake unto this crown as having sense,</line>
<line>And thus upbraided it: &#8220;The care on thee depending</line>
<line>Hath fed upon the body of my father;</line>
<line>Therefore thou best of gold art worst of gold.</line>
<line>Other, less fine in carat, is more precious,</line>
<line>Preserving life in med&#8217;cine potable;</line>
<line>But thou, most fine, most honor&#8217;d, most renown&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Hast eat thy bearer up.&#8221; Thus, my most royal liege,</line>
<line>Accusing it, I put it on my head,</line>
<line>To try with it, as with an enemy</line>
<line>That had before my face murdered my father,</line>
<line>The quarrel of a true inheritor.</line>
<line>But if it did infect my blood with joy,</line>
<line>Or swell my thoughts to any strain of pride,</line>
<line>If any rebel or vain spirit of mine</line>
<line>Did with the least affection of a welcome</line>
<line>Give entertainment to the might of it,</line>
<line>Let God forever keep it from my head,</line>
<line>And make me as the poorest vassal is</line>
<line>That doth with awe and terror kneel to it!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>KING.</speaker>
<line>O my son,</line>
<line>God put it in thy mind to take it hence,</line>
<line>That thou mightst win the more thy father&#8217;s love,</line>
<line>Pleading so wisely in excuse of it!</line>
<line>Come hither, Harry, sit thou by my bed,</line>
<line>And hear (I think) the very latest counsel</line>
<line>That ever I shall breathe. God knows, my son,</line>
<line>By what by-paths and indirect crook&#8217;d ways</line>
<line>I met this crown, and I myself know well</line>
<line>How troublesome it sate upon my head.</line>
<line>To thee it shall descend with better quiet,</line>
<line>Better opinion, better confirmation,</line>
<line>For all the soil of the achievement goes</line>
<line>With me into the earth. It seem&#8217;d in me</line>
<line>But as an honor snatch&#8217;d with boist&#8217;rous hand,</line>
<line>And I had many living to upbraid</line>
<line>My gain of it by their assistances,</line>
<line>Which daily grew to quarrel and to bloodshed,</line>
<line>Wounding supposed peace. All these bold fears</line>
<line>Thou seest with peril I have answered;</line>
<line>For all my reign hath been but as a scene</line>
<line>Acting that argument. And now my death</line>
<line>Changes the mood, for what in me was purchas&#8217;d</line>
<line>Falls upon thee in a more fairer sort;</line>
<line>So thou the garland wear&#8217;st successively.</line>
<line>Yet though thou stand&#8217;st more sure than I could do,</line>
<line>Thou art not firm enough, since griefs are green,</line>
<line>And all my friends, which thou must make thy friends,</line>
<line>Have but their stings and teeth newly ta&#8217;en out;</line>
<line>By whose fell working I was first advanc&#8217;d,</line>
<line>And by whose power I well might lodge a fear</line>
<line>To be again displac&#8217;d; which to avoid,</line>
<line>I cut them off, and had a purpose now</line>
<line>To lead out many to the Holy Land,</line>
<line>Lest rest and lying still might make them look</line>
<line>Too near unto my state. Therefore, my Harry,</line>
<line>Be it thy course to busy giddy minds</line>
<line>With foreign quarrels, that action, hence borne out,</line>
<line>May waste the memory of the former days.</line>
<line>More would I, but my lungs are wasted so</line>
<line>That strength of speech is utterly denied me.</line>

It is a wonderful thing to see the semblable coherence of his men&#8217;s spirits and his. They, by observing him, do bear themselves like foolish justices; he, by conversing with them, is turn&#8217;d into a justice-like servingman. Their spirits are so married in conjunction with the participation of society that they flock together in consent, like so many wild geese. If I had a suit to Master Shallow, I would humor his men with the imputation of being near their master; if to his men, I would curry with Master Shallow that no man could better command his servants. It is certain that either wise bearing or ignorant carriage is caught, as men take diseases, one of another; therefore let men take heed of their company. I will devise matter enough out of this Shallow to keep Prince Harry in continual laughter the wearing out of six fashions, which is four terms, or two actions, and &#8217;a shall laugh without intervallums. O, it is much that a lie with a slight oath and a jest with a sad brow will do with a fellow that never had the ache in his shoulders!

He asks the Lord Chief Justice to justify having had him locked up; when the Chief Justice argues that he represented the King at that moment, and that even princes must bow to the King&#8217;s peace, Hal approves.

<line>I then did use the person of your father,</line>
<line>The image of his power lay then in me,</line>
<line>And in th&#8217; administration of his law,</line>
<line>Whiles I was busy for the commonwealth,</line>
<line>Your Highness pleased to forget my place,</line>
<line>The majesty and power of law and justice,</line>
<line>The image of the King whom I presented,</line>
<line>And strook me in my very seat of judgment;</line>
<line>Whereon (as an offender to your father)</line>
<line>I gave bold way to my authority,</line>
<line>And did commit you. If the deed were ill,</line>
<line>Be you contented, wearing now the garland,</line>
<line>To have a son set your decrees at nought?</line>
<line>To pluck down justice from your aweful bench?</line>
<line>To trip the course of law and blunt the sword</line>
<line>That guards the peace and safety of your person?</line>
<line>Nay more, to spurn at your most royal image,</line>
<line>And mock your workings in a second body?</line>
<line>Question your royal thoughts, make the case yours:</line>
<line>Be now the father and propose a son,</line>
<line>Hear your own dignity so much profan&#8217;d,</line>
<line>See your most dreadful laws so loosely slighted,</line>
<line>Behold yourself so by a son disdained;</line>
<line>And then imagine me taking your part,</line>
<line>And in your power soft silencing your son.</line>
<line>After this cold considerance, sentence me,</line>
<line>And as you are a king, speak in your state</line>
<line>What I have done that misbecame my place,</line>
<line>My person, or my liege&#8217;s sovereignty.</line>

<speaker>PRINCE.</speaker>
<line>You are right justice, and you weigh this well,</line>
<line>Therefore still bear the balance and the sword,</line>
<line>And I do wish your honors may increase,</line>
<line>Till you do live to see a son of mine</line>
<line>Offend you and obey you, as I did.</line>
<line>So shall I live to speak my father&#8217;s words:</line>
<line>&#8220;Happy am I, that have a man so bold,</line>
<line>That dares do justice on my proper son;</line>
<line>And not less happy, having such a son</line>
<line>That would deliver up his greatness so</line>
<line>Into the hands of justice.&#8221; You did commit me;</line>
<line>For which I do commit into your hand</line>
<line>Th&#8217; unstained sword that you have us&#8217;d to bear,</line>
<line>With this remembrance, that you use the same</line>
<line>With the like bold, just, and impartial spirit</line>
<line>As you have done &#8217;gainst me. There is my hand.</line>
<line>You shall be as a father to my youth,</line>
<line>My voice shall sound as you do prompt mine ear,</line>
<line>And I will stoop and humble my intents</line>
<line>To your well-practic&#8217;d wise directions.</line>
<line>And, princes all, believe me, I beseech you,</line>
<line>My father is gone wild into his grave;</line>
<line>For in his tomb lie my affections,</line>
<line>And with his spirits sadly I survive,</line>
<line>To mock the expectation of the world,</line>
<line>To frustrate prophecies, and to rase out</line>
<line>Rotten opinion, who hath writ me down</line>
<line>After my seeming. The tide of blood in me</line>
<line>Hath proudly flow&#8217;d in vanity till now;</line>
<line>Now doth it turn and ebb back to the sea,</line>
<line>Where it shall mingle with the state of floods,</line>
<line>And flow henceforth in formal majesty.</line>
<line>Now call we our high court of parliament,</line>
<line>And let us choose such limbs of noble counsel</line>
<line>That the great body of our state may go</line>
<line>In equal rank with the best govern&#8217;d nation,</line>
<line>That war, or peace, or both at once, may be</line>
<line>As things acquainted and familiar to us,</line>
<line>In which you, father, shall have foremost hand.</line>
<line>Our coronation done, we will accite</line>
<line>(As I before rememb&#8217;red) all our state,</line>
<line>And (God consigning to my good intents)</line>
<line>No prince nor peer shall have just cause to say,</line>

He offers the knight a pension so that he will have no excuse to thieve, and promises to advance him if he mends his way, and refuses to acknowledge him as a friend. To comfort Shallow, to whom he owes a thousand pounds, Falstaff tells him that this attitude is merely the King&#8217;s necessary public one, and that he will be sent for in private.

<line>How ill white hairs becomes a fool and jester!</line>
<line>I have long dreamt of such a kind of man,</line>
<line>So surfeit-swell&#8217;d, so old, and so profane;</line>

<line>Reply not to me with a fool-born jest,</line>

<speaker>EPILOGUE.</speaker>
<line>First my fear, then my cur&#8217;sy, last my speech. My fear, is your displeasure, my cur&#8217;sy, my duty, and my speech, to beg your pardons. If you look for a good speech now, you undo me, for what I have to say is of mine own making, and what indeed (I should say) will (I doubt) prove mine own marring. But to the purpose, and so to the venture. Be it known to you, as it is very well, I was lately here in the end of a displeasing play, to pray your patience for it and to promise you a better. I meant indeed to pay you with this, which if like an ill venture it come unluckily home, I break, and you, my gentle creditors, lose. Here I promis&#8217;d you I would be, and here I commit my body to your mercies. Bate me some, and I will pay you some, and (as most debtors do) promise you infinitely; and so I kneel down before you&#8212;but, indeed, to pray for the Queen.</line>
<line>If my tongue cannot entreat you to acquit me, will you command me to use my legs? And yet that were but light payment, to dance out of your debt. But a good conscience will make any possible satisfaction, and so would I. All the gentlewomen here have forgiven me; if the gentlemen will not, then the gentlemen do not agree with the gentlewomen, which was never seen in such an assembly.</line>
<line>One word more, I beseech you. If you be not too much cloy&#8217;d with fat meat, our humble author will continue the story, with Sir John in it, and make you merry with fair Katherine of France, where (for any thing I know) Falstaff shall die of a sweat, unless already &#8217;a be kill&#8217;d with your hard opinions; for Oldcastle died a martyr, and this is not the man. My tongue is weary, when my legs are too, I will bid you good night.</line>
