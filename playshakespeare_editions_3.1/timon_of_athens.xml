<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POET.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good day, sir.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAIN.</SPEAKER>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POET.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have not seen you long, how goes the world?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAIN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It wears, sir, as it grows.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POET.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Ay, that&#8217;s well known;</LINE>
<LINE>But what particular rarity? What strange,</LINE>
<LINE>Which manifold record not matches? See,</LINE>
<LINE>Magic of bounty! All these spirits thy power</LINE>
<LINE>Hath conjur&#8217;d to attend. I know the merchant.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAIN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know them both; th&#8217; other&#8217;s a jeweller.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, &#8217;tis a worthy lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JEW.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Nay, that&#8217;s most fix&#8217;d.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A most incomparable man, breath&#8217;d, as it were,</LINE>
<LINE>To an untirable and continuate goodness;</LINE>
<LINE>He passes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>I have a jewel here&#8212;</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JEW.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If he will touch the estimate. But for that&#8212;</LINE>

<SPEAKER>POET.</SPEAKER>
<STAGEDIR>Reciting to himself.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>&#8220;When we for recompense have prais&#8217;d the vild,</LINE>
<LINE>It stains the glory in that happy verse</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MER.</SPEAKER>
<STAGEDIR>Looking on the jewel.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE offset="6">&#8217;Tis a good form.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JEW.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And rich. Here is a water, look ye.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAIN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You are rapt, sir, in some work, some dedication</LINE>
<LINE>To the great lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POET.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">A thing slipp&#8217;d idlely from me.</LINE>
<LINE>Our poesy is as a gum, which oozes</LINE>
<LINE>From whence &#8217;tis nourish&#8217;d. The fire i&#8217; th&#8217; flint</LINE>
<LINE>Shows not till it be strook; our gentle flame</LINE>
<LINE>Provokes itself and like the current flies</LINE>
<LINE>Each bound it chases. What have you there?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAIN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A picture, sir. When comes your book forth?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POET.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Upon the heels of my presentment, sir.</LINE>
<LINE>Let&#8217;s see your piece.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAIN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">&#8217;Tis a good piece.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POET.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So &#8217;tis. This comes off well and excellent.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAIN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Indifferent.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POET.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="3">Admirable! How this grace</LINE>
<LINE>Speaks his own standing! What a mental power</LINE>
<LINE>This eye shoots forth! How big imagination</LINE>
<LINE>Moves in this lip! To th&#8217; dumbness of the gesture</LINE>
<LINE>One might interpret.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAIN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is a pretty mocking of the life.</LINE>
<LINE>Here is a touch; is&#8217;t good?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POET.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">I will say of it,</LINE>
<LINE>It tutors nature. Artificial strife</LINE>
<LINE>Lives in these touches, livelier than life.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter certain Senators and pass over.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAIN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How this lord is followed!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POET.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The senators of Athens, happy men!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAIN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Look, more!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POET.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You see this confluence, this great flood of visitors.</LINE>
<LINE>I have, in this rough work, shap&#8217;d out a man</LINE>
<LINE>Whom this beneath world doth embrace and hug</LINE>
<LINE>With amplest entertainment. My free drift</LINE>
<LINE>Halts not particularly, but moves itself</LINE>
<LINE>In a wide sea of wax; no levell&#8217;d malice</LINE>
<LINE>Infects one comma in the course I hold,</LINE>
<LINE>But flies an eagle flight, bold, and forth on,</LINE>
<LINE>Leaving no tract behind.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAIN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How shall I understand you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POET.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">I will unbolt to you.</LINE>
<LINE>You see how all conditions, how all minds,</LINE>
<LINE>As well of glib and slipp&#8217;ry creatures as</LINE>
<LINE>Of grave and austere quality, tender down</LINE>
<LINE>Their services to Lord Timon. His large fortune,</LINE>
<LINE>Upon his good and gracious nature hanging,</LINE>
<LINE>Subdues and properties to his love and tendance</LINE>
<LINE>All sorts of hearts; yea, from the glass-fac&#8217;d flatterer</LINE>
<LINE>To Apemantus, that few things loves better</LINE>
<LINE>Than to abhor himself; even he drops down</LINE>
<LINE>The knee before him, and returns in peace</LINE>
<LINE>Most rich in Timon&#8217;s nod.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAIN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">I saw them speak together.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POET.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, I have upon a high and pleasant hill</LINE>
<LINE>Feign&#8217;d Fortune to be thron&#8217;d. The base o&#8217; th&#8217; mount</LINE>
<LINE>Is rank&#8217;d with all deserts, all kind of natures,</LINE>
<LINE>That labor on the bosom of this sphere</LINE>
<LINE>To propagate their states. Amongst them all,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose eyes are on this sovereign lady fix&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>One do I personate of Lord Timon&#8217;s frame,</LINE>
<LINE>Whom Fortune with her ivory hand wafts to her,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose present grace to present slaves and servants</LINE>
<LINE>Translates his rivals.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAIN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">&#8217;Tis conceiv&#8217;d to scope.</LINE>
<LINE>This throne, this Fortune, and this hill, methinks,</LINE>
<LINE>With one man beckon&#8217;d from the rest below,</LINE>
<LINE>Bowing his head against the steepy mount</LINE>
<LINE>To climb his happiness, would be well express&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>In our condition.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POET.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Nay, sir, but hear me on:</LINE>
<LINE>All those which were his fellows but of late&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Some better than his value&#8212;on the moment</LINE>
<LINE>Follow his strides, his lobbies fill with tendance,</LINE>
<LINE>Rain sacrificial whisperings in his ear,</LINE>
<LINE>Make sacred even his stirrup, and through him</LINE>
<LINE>Drink the free air.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAIN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Ay, marry, what of these?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POET.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>When Fortune in her shift and change of mood</LINE>
<LINE>Spurns down her late beloved, all his dependants</LINE>
<LINE>Which labor&#8217;d after him to the mountain&#8217;s top</LINE>
<LINE>Even on their knees and hands, let him slip down,</LINE>
<LINE>Not one accompanying his declining foot.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAIN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis common:</LINE>
<LINE>A thousand moral paintings I can show</LINE>
<LINE>That shall demonstrate these quick blows of Fortune&#8217;s</LINE>
<LINE>More pregnantly than words. Yet you do well</LINE>
<LINE>To show Lord Timon that mean eyes have seen</LINE>
<LINE>The foot above the head.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Trumpets sound. Enter Lord Timon, addressing himself courteously to every suitor, a Messenger from Ventidius talking with him; Lucilius and other Servants following.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Imprison&#8217;d is he, say you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MESS. VENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, my good lord, five talents is his debt,</LINE>
<LINE>His means most short, his creditors most strait.</LINE>
<LINE>Your honorable letter he desires</LINE>
<LINE>To those have shut him up, which failing,</LINE>
<LINE>Periods his comfort.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Noble Ventidius! Well;</LINE>
<LINE>I am not of that feather to shake off</LINE>
<LINE>My friend when he must need me. I do know him</LINE>
<LINE>A gentleman that well deserves a help,</LINE>
<LINE>Which he shall have. I&#8217;ll pay the debt and free him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MESS. VENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your lordship ever binds him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Commend me to him. I will send his ransom,</LINE>
<LINE>And being enfranchis&#8217;d, bid him come to me;</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis not enough to help the feeble up,</LINE>
<LINE>But to support him after. Fare you well.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MESS. VENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>All happiness to your honor!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit.</STAGEDIR>

<STAGEDIR>Enter an Old Athenian.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLD ATH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Lord Timon, hear me speak.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIM.</SPEAKER>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLD ATH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou hast a servant nam&#8217;d Lucilius.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have so. What of him?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLD ATH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Most noble Timon, call the man before thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Attends he here, or no? Lucilius!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here, at your lordship&#8217;s service.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLD ATH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This fellow here, Lord Timon, this thy creature,</LINE>
<LINE>By night frequents my house. I am a man</LINE>
<LINE>That from my first have been inclin&#8217;d to thrift,</LINE>
<LINE>And my estate deserves an heir more rais&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>Than one which holds a trencher.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">Well; what further?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLD ATH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>One only daughter have I, no kin else,</LINE>
<LINE>On whom I may confer what I have got.</LINE>
<LINE>The maid is fair, a&#8217; th&#8217; youngest for a bride,</LINE>
<LINE>And I have bred her at my dearest cost</LINE>
<LINE>In qualities of the best. This man of thine</LINE>
<LINE>Attempts her love. I prithee, noble lord,</LINE>
<LINE>Join with me to forbid him her resort,</LINE>
<LINE>Myself have spoke in vain.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">The man is honest.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLD ATH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Therefore he will be, Timon.</LINE>
<LINE>His honesty rewards him in itself,</LINE>
<LINE>It must not bear my daughter.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">Does she love him?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLD ATH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She is young and apt.</LINE>
<LINE>Our own precedent passions do instruct us</LINE>
<LINE>What levity&#8217;s in youth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIM.</SPEAKER>
<STAGEDIR>To Lucilius.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE offset="5">Love you the maid?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, my good lord, and she accepts of it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLD ATH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If in her marriage my consent be missing,</LINE>
<LINE>I call the gods to witness, I will choose</LINE>
<LINE>Mine heir from forth the beggars of the world,</LINE>
<LINE>And dispossess her all.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">How shall she be endowed,</LINE>
<LINE>If she be mated with an equal husband?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLD ATH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Three talents on the present; in future, all.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This gentleman of mine hath serv&#8217;d me long;</LINE>
<LINE>To build his fortune I will strain a little,</LINE>
<LINE>For &#8217;tis a bond in men. Give him thy daughter;</LINE>
<LINE>What you bestow, in him I&#8217;ll counterpoise,</LINE>
<LINE>And make him weigh with her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLD ATH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">Most noble lord,</LINE>
<LINE>Pawn me to this your honor, she is his.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My hand to thee, mine honor on my promise.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Humbly I thank your lordship. Never may</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAIN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A piece of painting, which I do beseech</LINE>
<LINE>Your lordship to accept.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Painting is welcome.</LINE>
<LINE>The painting is almost the natural man;</LINE>
<LINE>For since dishonor traffics with man&#8217;s nature,</LINE>
<LINE>He is but outside; these pencill&#8217;d figures are</LINE>
<LINE>Even such as they give out. I like your work,</LINE>
<LINE>And you shall find I like it. Wait attendance</LINE>
<LINE>Till you hear further from me.</LINE>

<LINE>A mere saciety of commendations;</LINE>
<LINE>If I should pay you for&#8217;t as &#8217;tis extoll&#8217;d,</LINE>

<LINE>As those which sell would give; but you well know,</LINE>
<LINE>Things of like value differing in the owners</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Time to be honest.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. LORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That time serves still.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>APEM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The most accursed thou, that still omit&#8217;st it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. LORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou art going to Lord Timon&#8217;s feast?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>APEM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, to see meat fill knaves, and wine heat fools.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. LORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fare thee well, fare thee well.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>APEM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou art a fool to bid me farewell twice.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. LORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, Apemantus?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>APEM.</SPEAKER>

<LINE>Away, unpeaceable dog, or I&#8217;ll spurn thee hence!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>The very heart of kindness.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. LORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He pours it out: Plutus, the god of gold,</LINE>
<LINE>Is but his steward. No meed but he repays</LINE>
<LINE>Sevenfold above itself; no gift to him</LINE>
<LINE>But breeds the giver a return exceeding</LINE>
<LINE>All use of quittance.</LINE>

<SCENEPERSONAE>(Flavius, Lord Timon, States, Athenian Lords, Alcibiades, Ventidius, Apemantus, Servants, Cupid, Ladies)</SCENEPERSONAE>

<STAGEDIR>Hoboys playing loud music. A great banquet serv&#8217;d in, Flavius and others attending; and then enter Lord Timon, the States, the Athenian Lords, Alcibiades, and Ventidius, which Timon redeem&#8217;d from prison. Then comes, dropping after all, Apemantus, discontentedly, like himself.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Most honored Timon,</LINE>
<LINE>It hath pleas&#8217;d the gods to remember my father&#8217;s age,</LINE>
<LINE>And call him to long peace.</LINE>
<LINE>He is gone happy, and has left me rich.</LINE>
<LINE>Then, as in grateful virtue I am bound</LINE>
<LINE>To your free heart, I do return those talents,</LINE>
<LINE>Doubled with thanks and service, from whose help</LINE>
<LINE>I deriv&#8217;d liberty.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="3">O, by no means,</LINE>
<LINE>Honest Ventidius. You mistake my love;</LINE>
<LINE>I gave it freely ever, and there&#8217;s none</LINE>
<LINE>Can truly say he gives if he receives.</LINE>
<LINE>If our betters play at that game, we must not dare</LINE>
<LINE>To imitate them; faults that are rich are fair.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A noble spirit!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="3">Nay, my lords,</LINE>
<LINE>Ceremony was but devis&#8217;d at first</LINE>
<LINE>To set a gloss on faint deeds, hollow welcomes,</LINE>
<LINE>Recanting goodness, sorry ere &#8217;tis shown;</LINE>
<LINE>But where there is true friendship, there needs none.</LINE>
<LINE>Pray sit, more welcome are ye to my fortunes</LINE>
<LINE>Than my fortunes to me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>They sit.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. LORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, we always have confess&#8217;d it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>APEM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ho, ho, confess&#8217;d it? Hang&#8217;d it, have you not?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, Apemantus, you are welcome.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>APEM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">No;</LINE>
<LINE>You shall not make me welcome.</LINE>
<LINE>I come to have thee thrust me out of doors.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fie, th&#8217; art a churl. Ye have got a humor there</LINE>
<LINE>Does not become a man, &#8217;tis much to blame.</LINE>
<LINE>They say, my lords, &#8220;<LATIN lang="la">Ira furor brevis est</LATIN>,&#8221;</LINE>
<LINE>But yond man is very angry. Go,</LINE>
<LINE>Let him have a table by himself,</LINE>
<LINE>For he does neither affect company,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor is he fit for&#8217;t indeed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>APEM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let me stay at thine apperil, Timon.</LINE>
<LINE>I come to observe, I give thee warning on&#8217;t.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I take no heed of thee; th&#8217; art an Athenian, therefore welcome. I myself would have no power; prithee let my meat make thee silent.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>APEM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I scorn thy meat, &#8217;twould choke me; for I should ne&#8217;er flatter thee. O you gods! What a number of men eats Timon, and he sees &#8217;em not! It grieves me to see so many dip their meat in one man&#8217;s blood, and all the madness is, he cheers them up too.</LINE>
<LINE>I wonder men dare trust themselves with men.</LINE>
<LINE>Methinks they should invite them without knives:</LINE>
<LINE>Good for their meat, and safer for their lives.</LINE>
<LINE>There&#8217;s much example for&#8217;t: the fellow that sits next him, now parts bread with him, pledges the breath of him in a divided draught, is the readiest man to kill him; &#8217;t &#8217;as been prov&#8217;d. If I were a huge man, I should fear to drink at meals,</LINE>
<LINE>Lest they should spy my windpipe&#8217;s dangerous notes:</LINE>
<LINE>Great men should drink with harness on their throats.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, in heart; and let the health go round.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. LORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let it flow this way, my good lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>APEM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Flow this way? A brave fellow! He keeps his tides well. Those healths will make thee and thy state look ill, Timon.</LINE>
<LINE>Here&#8217;s that which is too weak to be a sinner,</LINE>
<LINE>Honest water, which ne&#8217;er left man i&#8217; th&#8217; mire.</LINE>
<LINE>This and my food are equals, there&#8217;s no odds;</LINE>
<LINE>Feasts are too proud to give thanks to the gods.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Apemantus&#8217; grace.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE><RECITE>Immortal gods, I crave no pelf,</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>I pray for no man but myself.</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>Grant I may never prove so fond,</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>To trust man on his oath or bond;</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>Or a harlot for her weeping,</RECITE></LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Captain Alcibiades, your heart&#8217;s in the field now.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALCIB.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My heart is ever at your service, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You had rather be at a breakfast of enemies than a dinner of friends.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALCIB.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So they were bleeding new, my lord, there&#8217;s no meat like &#8217;em; I could wish my best friend at such a feast.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>APEM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Would all those flatterers were thine enemies then, that then thou mightst kill &#8217;em&#8212;and bid me to &#8217;em!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. LORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Might we but have that happiness, my lord, that you would once use our hearts, whereby we might express some part of our zeals, we should think ourselves forever perfect.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, no doubt, my good friends, but the gods themselves have provided that I shall have much help from you: how had you been my friends else? Why have you that charitable title from thousands, did not you chiefly belong to my heart? I have told more of you to myself than you can with modesty speak in your own behalf; and thus far I confirm you. O you gods, think I, what need we have any friends, if we should ne&#8217;er have need of &#8217;em? They were the most needless creatures living, should we ne&#8217;er have use for &#8217;em; and would most resemble sweet instruments hung up in cases, that keeps their sounds to themselves. Why, I have often wish&#8217;d myself poorer, that I might come nearer to you. We are born to do benefits; and what better or properer can we call our own than the riches of our friends? O, what a precious comfort &#8217;tis to have so many like brothers commanding one another&#8217;s fortunes! O, joy&#8217;s e&#8217;en made away ere&#8217;t can be born! Mine eyes cannot hold out water, methinks. To forget their faults, I drink to you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>APEM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou weep&#8217;st to make them drink, Timon.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. LORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Joy had the like conception in our eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>And at that instant like a babe sprung up.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>APEM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ho, ho! I laugh to think that babe a bastard.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Hoy-day,</LINE>

<LINE>They dance? They are madwomen.</LINE>
<LINE>Like madness is the glory of this life,</LINE>
<LINE>As this pomp shows to a little oil and root.</LINE>
<LINE>We make ourselves fools to disport ourselves,</LINE>
<LINE>And spend our flatteries to drink those men</LINE>
<LINE>Upon whose age we void it up again</LINE>
<LINE>With poisonous spite and envy.</LINE>
<LINE>Who lives that&#8217;s not depraved or depraves?</LINE>
<LINE>Who dies that bears not one spurn to their graves</LINE>
<LINE>Of their friends&#8217; gift?</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>The Lords rise from table, with much adoring of Timon, and to show their loves, each single out an Amazon, and all dance, men with women, a lofty strain or two to the hoboys, and cease.</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>Nor will he know his purse, or yield me this,</LINE>
<LINE>To show him what a beggar his heart is,</LINE>
<LINE>Being of no power to make his wishes good.</LINE>
<LINE>His promises fly so beyond his state</LINE>
<LINE>That what he speaks is all in debt: he owes</LINE>
<LINE>For ev&#8217;ry word. He is so kind that he now</LINE>
<LINE>Pays interest for&#8217;t; his land&#8217;s put to their books.</LINE>
<LINE>Well, would I were gently put out of office</LINE>
<LINE>Before I were forc&#8217;d out!</LINE>

<LINE>No, I&#8217;ll nothing; for if I should be brib&#8217;d too, there would be none left to rail upon thee, and then thou wouldst sin the faster. Thou giv&#8217;st so long, Timon (I fear me), thou wilt give away thyself in paper shortly. What needs these feasts, pomps, and vainglories?</LINE>

<LINE>If I would sell my horse and buy twenty more</LINE>
<LINE>Better than he, why, give my horse to Timon,</LINE>
<LINE>Ask nothing, give it him, it foals me straight</LINE>

<LINE>Yea, &#8217;gainst th&#8217; authority of manners, pray&#8217;d you</LINE>
<LINE>To hold your hand more close. I did endure</LINE>
<LINE>Not seldom, nor no slight checks, when I have</LINE>
<LINE>Prompted you in the ebb of your estate</LINE>
<LINE>And your great flow of debts. My lov&#8217;d lord,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">You gods, reward them!</LINE>

<LINE>Their blood is cak&#8217;d, &#8217;tis cold, it seldom flows;</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis lack of kindly warmth they are not kind;</LINE>
<LINE>And nature, as it grows again toward earth,</LINE>
<LINE>Is fashion&#8217;d for the journey, dull and heavy.</LINE>
<LINE>Go to Ventidius. (Prithee be not sad,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou art true and honest; ingeniously I speak,</LINE>
<LINE>No blame belongs to thee.) Ventidius lately</LINE>
<LINE>Buried his father, by whose death he&#8217;s stepp&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>Into a great estate. When he was poor,</LINE>
<LINE>Imprison&#8217;d, and in scarcity of friends,</LINE>
<LINE>I clear&#8217;d him with five talents. Greet him from me,</LINE>
<LINE>Bid him suppose some good necessity</LINE>
<LINE>Touches his friend, which craves to be rememb&#8217;red</LINE>
<LINE>With those five talents. That had, give&#8217;t these fellows</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Aside.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>One of Lord Timon&#8217;s men? A gift, I warrant. Why, this hits right; I dreamt of a silver basin and ew&#8217;r tonight.&#8212;Flaminius, honest Flaminius, you are very respectively welcome, sir. Fill me some wine.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit Lucullus&#8217;s Servant.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>And how does that honorable, complete, free-hearted gentleman of Athens, thy very bountiful good lord and master?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FLAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>His health is well, sir.</LINE>

<LINE>I am right glad that his health is well, sir; and what hast thou there under thy cloak, pretty Flaminius?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FLAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Faith, nothing but an empty box, sir, which, in my lord&#8217;s behalf, I come to entreat your honor to supply; who, having great and instant occasion to use fifty talents, hath sent to your lordship to furnish him, nothing doubting your present assistance therein.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCUL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>La, la, la, la! &#8220;nothing doubting,&#8221; says he? Alas, good lord! A noble gentleman &#8217;tis, if he would not keep so good a house. Many a time and often I ha&#8217; din&#8217;d with him, and told him on&#8217;t, and come again to supper to him of purpose to have him spend less, and yet he would embrace no counsel, take no warning by my coming. Every man has his fault, and honesty is his. I ha&#8217; told him on&#8217;t, but I could ne&#8217;er get him from&#8217;t.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>To Servant.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Get you gone, sirrah.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit Lucullus&#8217;s Servant.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Draw nearer, honest Flaminius. Thy lord&#8217;s a bountiful gentleman, but thou art wise, and thou know&#8217;st well enough (although thou com&#8217;st to me) that this is no time to lend money, especially upon bare friendship without security. Here&#8217;s three solidares for thee; good boy, wink at me, and say thou saw&#8217;st me not. Fare thee well.</LINE>

<LINE>Has friendship such a faint and milky heart,</LINE>
<LINE>It turns in less than two nights? O you gods!</LINE>
<LINE>I feel my master&#8217;s passion. This slave</LINE>
<LINE>Unto his honor has my lord&#8217;s meat in him;</LINE>
<LINE>Why should it thrive and turn to nutriment</LINE>
<LINE>When he is turn&#8217;d to poison?</LINE>
<LINE>O, may diseases only work upon&#8217;t!</LINE>
<LINE>And when he&#8217;s sick to death, let not that part of nature</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who, the Lord Timon? He is my very good friend, and an honorable gentleman.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. STRAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We know him for no less, though we are but strangers to him. But I can tell you one thing, my lord, and which I hear from common rumors, now Lord Timon&#8217;s happy hours are done and past, and his estate shrinks from him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fie, no, do not believe it; he cannot want for money.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. STRAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But believe you this, my lord, that not long ago one of his men was with the Lord Lucullus to borrow so many talents, nay, urg&#8217;d extremely for&#8217;t, and show&#8217;d what necessity belong&#8217;d to&#8217;t, and yet was denied.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. STRAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I tell you, denied, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What a strange case was that! Now before the gods, I am asham&#8217;d on&#8217;t. Denied that honorable man? There was very little honor show&#8217;d in&#8217;t. For my own part, I must needs confess, I have receiv&#8217;d some small kindnesses from him, as money, plate, jewels, and such like trifles&#8212;nothing comparing to his&#8212;yet had he mistook him and sent to me, I should ne&#8217;er have denied his occasion so many talents.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Servilius.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>See, by good hap, yonder&#8217;s my lord; I have sweat to see his honor. My honor&#8217;d lord&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Servilius? You are kindly met, sir. Fare thee well, commend me to thy honorable virtuous lord, my very exquisite friend.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>May it please your honor, my lord hath sent&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ha? What has he sent? I am so much endear&#8217;d to that lord: he&#8217;s ever sending. How shall I thank him, think&#8217;st thou? And what has he sent now?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>H&#8217;as only sent his present occasion now, my lord; requesting your lordship to supply his instant use with so many talents.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know his lordship is but merry with me;</LINE>
<LINE>He cannot want fifty&#8212;five hundred talents.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But in the mean time he wants less, my lord.</LINE>
<LINE>If his occasion were not virtuous,</LINE>
<LINE>I should not urge it half so faithfully.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Dost thou speak seriously, Servilius?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Upon my soul, &#8217;tis true, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What a wicked beast was I to disfurnish myself against such a good time, when I might ha&#8217; shown myself honorable! How unluckily it happ&#8217;ned that I should purchase the day before for a little part, and undo a great deal of honor! Servilius, now before the gods, I am not able to do (the more beast, I say!)&#8212;I was sending to use Lord Timon myself, these gentlemen can witness; but I would not, for the wealth of Athens, I had done&#8217;t now. Commend me bountifully to his good lordship, and I hope his honor will conceive the fairest of me, because I have no power to be kind. And tell him this from me, I count it one of my greatest afflictions, say, that I cannot pleasure such an honorable gentleman. Good Servilius, will you befriend me so far as to use mine own words to him?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, sir, I shall.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit Servilius.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEAKER>LUC.</SPEAKER>
<STAGEDIR>Calling after him.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll look you out a good turn, Servilius.&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>True, as you said, Timon is shrunk indeed,</LINE>
<LINE>And he that&#8217;s once denied will hardly speed.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. STRAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, this is the world&#8217;s soul, and just of the same piece</LINE>
<LINE>Is every flatterer&#8217;s sport. Who can call him</LINE>
<LINE>His friend that dips in the same dish? For, in</LINE>
<LINE>My knowing, Timon has been this lord&#8217;s father,</LINE>
<LINE>And kept his credit with his purse;</LINE>
<LINE>Supported his estate, nay, Timon&#8217;s money</LINE>
<LINE>Has paid his men their wages. He ne&#8217;er drinks</LINE>
<LINE>But Timon&#8217;s silver treads upon his lip,</LINE>
<LINE>And yet&#8212;O, see the monstrousness of man</LINE>
<LINE>When he looks out in an ungrateful shape!&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>He does deny him (in respect of his)</LINE>
<LINE>What charitable men afford to beggars.</LINE>

<LINE>For his right noble mind, illustrious virtue,</LINE>
<LINE>And honorable carriage,</LINE>
<LINE>Had his necessity made use of me,</LINE>
<LINE>I would have put my wealth into donation,</LINE>
<LINE>And the best half should have return&#8217;d to him,</LINE>

<LINE offset="6">How? Have they denied him?</LINE>
<LINE>Has Ventidius and Lucullus denied him,</LINE>
<LINE>And does he send to me? Three? Humh!</LINE>
<LINE>It shows but little love or judgment in him.</LINE>
<LINE>Must I be his last refuge? His friends, like physicians,</LINE>
<LINE>Thrive, give him over; must I take th&#8217; cure upon me?</LINE>
<LINE>H&#8217;as much disgrac&#8217;d me in&#8217;t, I&#8217;m angry at him,</LINE>
<LINE>That might have known my place. I see no sense for&#8217;t,</LINE>
<LINE>But his occasions might have wooed me first;</LINE>
<LINE>For, in my conscience, I was the first man</LINE>

<LINE>And does he think so backwardly of me now,</LINE>

<LINE>So it may prove an argument of laughter</LINE>
<LINE>To th&#8217; rest, and &#8217;mongst lords I be thought a fool.</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;d rather than the worth of thrice the sum</LINE>
<LINE>H&#8217;ad sent to me first, but for my mind&#8217;s sake;</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;d such a courage to do him good. But now return,</LINE>

<LINE>Excellent! Your lordship&#8217;s a goodly villain. The devil knew not what he did when he made man politic; he cross&#8217;d himself by&#8217;t; and I cannot think but, in the end, the villainies of man will set him clear. How fairly this lord strives to appear foul! Takes virtuous copies to be wicked; like those that under hot ardent zeal would set whole realms on fire; of such a nature is his politic love.</LINE>
<LINE>This was my lord&#8217;s best hope, now all are fled,</LINE>
<LINE>Save only the gods. Now his friends are dead,</LINE>
<LINE>Doors, that were ne&#8217;er acquainted with their wards</LINE>

<SPEAKER>LUC. SERV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">Ay, and I think</LINE>
<LINE>One business does command us all; for mine</LINE>
<LINE>Is money.</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>So is theirs and ours.</LINE>

<LINE>What do you think the hour?</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PHI.</SPEAKER>

<SPEAKER>PHI.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I wonder on&#8217;t, he was wont to shine at seven.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC. SERV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, but the days are wax&#8217;d shorter with him.</LINE>
<LINE>You must consider that a prodigal course</LINE>
<LINE>Is like the sun&#8217;s, but not like his recoverable,</LINE>
<LINE>I fear. &#8217;Tis deepest winter in Lord Timon&#8217;s purse;</LINE>
<LINE>That is, one may reach deep enough and yet</LINE>
<LINE>Find little.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PHI.</SPEAKER>

<LINE>I&#8217;ll show you how t&#8217; observe a strange event.</LINE>
<LINE>Your lord sends now for money.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">Most true, he does.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And he wears jewels now of Timon&#8217;s gift,</LINE>
<LINE>For which I wait for money.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is against my heart.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC. SERV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Mark how strange it shows,</LINE>
<LINE>Timon in this should pay more than he owes;</LINE>
<LINE>And e&#8217;en as if your lord should wear rich jewels</LINE>
<LINE>And send for money for &#8217;em.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I&#8217;m weary of this charge, the gods can witness.</LINE>
<LINE>I know my lord hath spent of Timon&#8217;s wealth,</LINE>
<LINE>And now ingratitude makes it worse than stealth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. VAR. SERV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, mine&#8217;s three thousand crowns; what&#8217;s yours?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC. SERV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Five thousand mine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. VAR. SERV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis much deep, and it should seem by th&#8217; sum</LINE>
<LINE>Your master&#8217;s confidence was above mine,</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FLAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, indeed he is not.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We attend his lordship; pray signify so much.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>FLAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I need not tell him that, he knows you are too diligent.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit.</STAGEDIR>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Steward Flavius in a cloak, muffled.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC. SERV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ha! Is not that his steward muffled so?</LINE>
<LINE>He goes away in a cloud; call him, call him.</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We wait for certain money here, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FLAV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="8">Ay,</LINE>
<LINE>If money were as certain as your waiting,</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Twere sure enough.</LINE>
<LINE>Why then preferr&#8217;d you not your sums and bills</LINE>
<LINE>When your false masters eat of my lord&#8217;s meat?</LINE>
<LINE>Then they could smile, and fawn upon his debts,</LINE>
<LINE>And take down th&#8217; int&#8217;rest into their glutt&#8217;nous maws.</LINE>
<LINE>You do yourselves but wrong to stir me up,</LINE>
<LINE>Let me pass quietly.</LINE>
<LINE>Believe&#8217;t, my lord and I have made an end:</LINE>
<LINE>I have no more to reckon, he to spend.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC. SERV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, but this answer will not serve.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FLAV.</SPEAKER>

<SPEAKER>1. VAR. SERV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How? What does his cashier&#8217;d worship mutter?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. VAR. SERV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No matter what, he&#8217;s poor, and that&#8217;s revenge enough. Who can speak broader than he that has no house to put his head in? Such may rail against great buildings.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Servilius.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, here&#8217;s Servilius; now we shall know some answer.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If I might beseech you, gentlemen, to repair some other hour, I should derive much from&#8217;t; for take&#8217;t of my soul, my lord leans wondrously to discontent. His comfortable temper has forsook him, he&#8217;s much out of health, and keeps his chamber.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUC. SERV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Many do keep their chambers are not sick;</LINE>
<LINE>And if it be so far beyond his health,</LINE>
<LINE>Methinks he should the sooner pay his debts,</LINE>
<LINE>And make a clear way to the gods.</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<SPEAKER>TIM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, are my doors oppos&#8217;d against my passage?</LINE>
<LINE>Have I been ever free, and must my house</LINE>
<LINE>Be my retentive enemy? My jail?</LINE>
<LINE>The place which I have feasted, does it now</LINE>
<LINE>(Like all mankind) show me an iron heart?</LINE>

<LINE>Faith, I perceive our masters may throw their caps at their money. These debts may well be call&#8217;d desperate ones, for a madman owes &#8217;em.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter three Senators at one door, Alcibiades meeting them, with Attendants.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. SEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, you have my voice to&#8217;t; the fault&#8217;s</LINE>
<LINE>Bloody; &#8217;tis necessary he should die.</LINE>
<LINE>Nothing emboldens sin so much as mercy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. SEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Most true; the law shall bruise &#8217;em.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALCIB.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Honor, health, and compassion to the Senate!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. SEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, captain?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALCIB.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am an humble suitor to your virtues;</LINE>
<LINE>For pity is the virtue of the law,</LINE>
<LINE>And none but tyrants use it cruelly.</LINE>
<LINE>It pleases time and fortune to lie heavy</LINE>
<LINE>Upon a friend of mine, who in hot blood</LINE>
<LINE>Hath stepp&#8217;d into the law, which is past depth</LINE>
<LINE>To those that (without heed) do plunge into&#8217;t.</LINE>
<LINE>He is a man (setting his fate aside)</LINE>
<LINE>Of comely virtues;</LINE>
<LINE>Nor did he soil the fact with cowardice</LINE>
<LINE>(An honor in him which buys out his fault),</LINE>
<LINE>But with a noble fury and fair spirit,</LINE>
<LINE>Seeing his reputation touch&#8217;d to death,</LINE>
<LINE>He did oppose his foe;</LINE>
<LINE>And with such sober and unnoted passion</LINE>
<LINE>He did behoove his anger, ere &#8217;twas spent,</LINE>
<LINE>As if he had but prov&#8217;d an argument.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. SEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You undergo too strict a paradox,</LINE>
<LINE>Striving to make an ugly deed look fair.</LINE>
<LINE>Your words have took such pains as if they labor&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>To bring manslaughter into form, and set quarrelling</LINE>
<LINE>Upon the head of valor; which indeed</LINE>
<LINE>Is valor misbegot, and came into the world</LINE>
<LINE>When sects and factions were newly born.</LINE>
<LINE>He&#8217;s truly valiant that can wisely suffer</LINE>
<LINE>The worst that man can breathe, and make his wrongs</LINE>
<LINE>His outsides, to wear them like his raiment, carelessly,</LINE>
<LINE>And ne&#8217;er prefer his injuries to his heart,</LINE>
<LINE>To bring it into danger.</LINE>
<LINE>If wrongs be evils and enforce us kill,</LINE>
<LINE>What folly &#8217;tis to hazard life for ill!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALCIB.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. SEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="2">You cannot make gross sins look clear;</LINE>
<LINE>To revenge is no valor, but to bear.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALCIB.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lords, then, under favor, pardon me</LINE>
<LINE>If I speak like a captain.</LINE>
<LINE>Why do fond men expose themselves to battle,</LINE>
<LINE>And not endure all threats? Sleep upon&#8217;t,</LINE>
<LINE>And let the foes quietly cut their throats</LINE>
<LINE>Without repugnancy? If there be</LINE>
<LINE>Such valor in the bearing, what make we</LINE>
<LINE>Abroad? Why then, women are more valiant</LINE>
<LINE>That stay at home, if bearing carry it;</LINE>
<LINE>And the ass more captain than the lion, the fellow</LINE>
<LINE>Loaden with irons wiser than the judge,</LINE>
<LINE>If wisdom be in suffering. O my lords,</LINE>
<LINE>As you are great, be pitifully good.</LINE>
<LINE>Who cannot condemn rashness in cold blood?</LINE>
<LINE>To kill, I grant, is sin&#8217;s extremest gust,</LINE>
<LINE>But in defense, by mercy, &#8217;tis most just.</LINE>
<LINE>To be in anger is impiety;</LINE>
<LINE>But who is man that is not angry?</LINE>
<LINE>Weigh but the crime with this.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. SEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You breathe in vain.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALCIB.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">In vain? His service done</LINE>
<LINE>At Lacedaemon and Byzantium</LINE>
<LINE>Were a sufficient briber for his life.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. SEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What&#8217;s that?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALCIB.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="3">Why, I say, my lords, h&#8217;as done fair service,</LINE>
<LINE>And slain in fight many of your enemies.</LINE>
<LINE>How full of valor did he bear himself</LINE>
<LINE>In the last conflict, and made plenteous wounds!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. SEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He has made too much plenty with &#8217;em.</LINE>
<LINE>He&#8217;s a sworn rioter; he has a sin that often</LINE>
<LINE>Drowns him and takes his valor prisoner.</LINE>
<LINE>If there were no foes, that were enough</LINE>
<LINE>To overcome him. In that beastly fury</LINE>
<LINE>He has been known to commit outrages</LINE>
<LINE>And cherish factions. &#8217;Tis inferr&#8217;d to us,</LINE>
<LINE>His days are foul and his drink dangerous.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. SEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He dies.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALCIB.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="2">Hard fate! He might have died in war.</LINE>
<LINE>My lords, if not for any parts in him&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Though his right arm might purchase his own time</LINE>
<LINE>And be in debt to none&#8212;yet more to move you,</LINE>
<LINE>Take my deserts to his, and join &#8217;em both;</LINE>
<LINE>And for I know your reverend ages love</LINE>
<LINE>Security, I&#8217;ll pawn my victories, all</LINE>
<LINE>My honor to you, upon his good returns.</LINE>
<LINE>If by this crime he owes the law his life,</LINE>
<LINE>Why, let the war receive&#8217;t in valiant gore,</LINE>
<LINE>For law is strict, and war is nothing more.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. SEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We are for law, he dies, urge it no more</LINE>
<LINE>On height of our displeasure. Friend, or brother,</LINE>

<LINE>Now the gods keep you old enough that you may live</LINE>

<LINE>I&#8217;m worse than mad. I have kept back their foes,</LINE>
<LINE>While they have told their money, and let out</LINE>
<LINE>Their coin upon large interest&#8212;I myself</LINE>
<LINE>Rich only in large hurts. All those, for this?</LINE>
<LINE>Is this the balsom that the usuring Senate</LINE>
<LINE>Pours into captains&#8217; wounds? Banishment!</LINE>
<LINE>It comes not ill; I hate not to be banish&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>It is a cause worthy my spleen and fury,</LINE>
<LINE>That I may strike at Athens. I&#8217;ll cheer up</LINE>

<LINE>It should not be, by the persuasion of his new feasting.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>I should think so. He hath sent me an earnest inviting, which many my near occasions did urge me to put off; but he hath conjur&#8217;d me beyond them, and I must needs appear.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>3. LORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll tell you more anon. Here&#8217;s a noble feast toward.</LINE>

<LINE>This is the old man still.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>It does; but time will&#8212;and so&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>3. LORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do conceive.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Each man to his stool, with that spur as he would to the lip of his mistress; your diet shall be in all places alike. Make not a city feast of it, to let the meat cool ere we can agree upon the first place; sit, sit. The gods require our thanks.</LINE>
<LINE>You great benefactors, sprinkle our society with thankfulness. For your own gifts, make yourselves prais&#8217;d; but reserve still to give, lest your deities be despis&#8217;d. Lend to each man enough, that one need not lend to another; for were your godheads to borrow of men, men would forsake the gods. Make the meat be belov&#8217;d more than the man that gives it. Let no assembly of twenty be without a score of villains. If there sit twelve women at the table, let a dozen of them be&#8212;as they are. The rest of your fees, O gods&#8212;the senators of Athens, together with the common lag of people&#8212;what is amiss in them, you gods, make suitable for destruction. For these my present friends, as they are to me nothing, so in nothing bless them, and to nothing are they welcome.</LINE>
<LINE>Uncover, dogs, and lap!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>The dishes are uncovered and seen to be full of warm water.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEAKER>SOME OTHER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>May you a better feast never behold,</LINE>
<LINE>You knot of mouth-friends! Smoke and lukewarm water</LINE>
<LINE>Is your perfection. This is Timon&#8217;s last,</LINE>
<LINE>Who, stuck and spangled with your flatteries,</LINE>
<LINE>Washes it off, and sprinkles in your faces</LINE>
<LINE>Your reeking villainy.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Throwing the water in their faces.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Live loath&#8217;d, and long,</LINE>
<LINE>Most smiling, smooth, detested parasites,</LINE>
<LINE>Courteous destroyers, affable wolves, meek bears,</LINE>
<LINE>You fools of fortune, trencher-friends, time&#8217;s flies,</LINE>
<LINE>Cap-and-knee slaves, vapors, and minute-jacks!</LINE>
<LINE>Of man and beast the infinite malady</LINE>
<LINE>Crust you quite o&#8217;er! What, dost thou go?</LINE>
<LINE>Soft, take thy physic first&#8212;thou too&#8212;and thou;</LINE>
<LINE>Stay, I will lend thee money, borrow none.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Throws the dishes at them, and drives them out.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>What? All in motion? Henceforth be no feast</LINE>
<LINE>Whereat a villain&#8217;s not a welcome guest.</LINE>
<LINE>Burn house! Sink Athens! Henceforth hated be</LINE>
<LINE>Of Timon man and all humanity!</LINE>

<LINE>Obedience, fail in children! Slaves and fools,</LINE>

<LINE>Be general leprosy! Breath, infect breath,</LINE>
<LINE>That their society (as their friendship) may</LINE>

<LINE>O, the fierce wretchedness that glory brings us!</LINE>
<LINE>Who would not wish to be from wealth exempt,</LINE>

<LINE>Who would be so mock&#8217;d with glory, or to live</LINE>
<LINE>But in a dream of friendship,</LINE>
<LINE>To have his pomp, and all what state compounds,</LINE>
<LINE>But only painted, like his varnish&#8217;d friends?</LINE>
<LINE>Poor honest lord, brought low by his own heart,</LINE>

<LINE>Scarce is dividant, touch them with several fortunes,</LINE>

<LINE>Raise me this beggar, and deny&#8217;t that lord,</LINE>

<LINE>Pity not honor&#8217;d age for his white beard,</LINE>
<LINE>He is an usurer. Strike me the counterfeit matron,</LINE>
<LINE>It is her habit only that is honest,</LINE>
<LINE>Herself&#8217;s a bawd. Let not the virgin&#8217;s cheek</LINE>
<LINE>Make soft thy trenchant sword; for those milk paps,</LINE>
<LINE>That through the window-bars bore at men&#8217;s eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>Are not within the leaf of pity writ,</LINE>
<LINE>But set them down horrible traitors. Spare not the babe,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose dimpled smiles from fools exhaust their mercy;</LINE>
<LINE>Think it a bastard, whom the oracle</LINE>
<LINE>Hath doubtfully pronounc&#8217;d the throat shall cut,</LINE>

<LINE>And not believes himself. Down with the nose,</LINE>
<LINE>Down with it flat; take the bridge quite away</LINE>
<LINE>Of him that, his particular to foresee,</LINE>
<LINE>Smells from the general weal. Make curl&#8217;d-pate ruffians bald,</LINE>

<LINE>Thy flatterers yet wear silk, drink wine, lie soft,</LINE>

<LINE>And let his very breath whom thou&#8217;lt observe</LINE>

<LINE>Will put thy shirt on warm? Will these moist trees,</LINE>

<LINE>The one is filling still, never complete;</LINE>
<LINE>The other, at high wish. Best state, contentless,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not by his breath that is more miserable.</LINE>
<LINE>Thou art a slave, whom Fortune&#8217;s tender arm</LINE>
<LINE>With favor never clasp&#8217;d, but bred a dog.</LINE>
<LINE>Hadst thou like us from our first swath proceeded</LINE>
<LINE>The sweet degrees that this brief world affords</LINE>
<LINE>To such as may the passive drugs of it</LINE>
<LINE>Freely command, thou wouldst have plung&#8217;d thyself</LINE>
<LINE>In general riot, melted down thy youth</LINE>
<LINE>In different beds of lust, and never learn&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>The icy precepts of respect, but followed</LINE>
<LINE>The sug&#8217;red game before thee. But myself,</LINE>
<LINE>Who had the world as my confectionary,</LINE>
<LINE>The mouths, the tongues, the eyes, and hearts of men</LINE>
<LINE>At duty, more than I could frame employment;</LINE>
<LINE>That numberless upon me stuck as leaves</LINE>
<LINE>Do on the oak, have with one winter&#8217;s brush</LINE>
<LINE>Fell from their boughs, and left me open, bare,</LINE>
<LINE>For every storm that blows&#8212;I to bear this,</LINE>
<LINE>That never knew but better, is some burden:</LINE>
<LINE>Thy nature did commence in sufferance, time</LINE>
<LINE>Hath made thee hard in&#8217;t. Why shouldst thou hate men?</LINE>
<LINE>They never flatter&#8217;d thee. What hast thou given?</LINE>
<LINE>If thou wilt curse, thy father (that poor rag)</LINE>
<LINE>Must be thy subject, who in spite put stuff</LINE>
<LINE>To some she-beggar and compounded thee</LINE>
<LINE>Poor rogue hereditary. Hence, be gone!</LINE>

<LINE>Let us make the assay upon him. If he care not for&#8217;t, he will supply us easily; if he covetously reserve it, how shall &#8217;s get it?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. BAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>True; for he bears it not about him, &#8217;tis hid.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>ALL OTHER BAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;Save thee, Timon.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, thieves?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALL OTHER BAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Soldiers, not thieves.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Both too, and women&#8217;s sons.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALL BAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We are not thieves, but men that much do want.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your greatest want is, you want much of meat.</LINE>
<LINE>Why should you want? Behold, the earth hath roots;</LINE>
<LINE>Within this mile break forth a hundred springs;</LINE>
<LINE>The oaks bear mast, the briers scarlet heps;</LINE>
<LINE>The bounteous huswife Nature on each bush</LINE>
<LINE>Lays her full mess before you. Want? Why want?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. BAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We cannot live on grass, on berries, water,</LINE>
<LINE>As beasts and birds and fishes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nor on the beasts themselves, the birds and fishes;</LINE>
<LINE>You must eat men. Yet thanks I must you con</LINE>
<LINE>That you are thieves profess&#8217;d, that you work not</LINE>
<LINE>In holier shapes; for there is boundless theft</LINE>
<LINE>In limited professions. Rascal thieves,</LINE>
<LINE>Here&#8217;s gold. Go, suck the subtle blood o&#8217; th&#8217; grape,</LINE>
<LINE>Till the high fever seethe your blood to froth,</LINE>
<LINE>And so scape hanging. Trust not the physician,</LINE>
<LINE>His antidotes are poison, and he slays</LINE>
<LINE>More than you rob. Take wealth and lives together,</LINE>
<LINE>Do, villains, do, since you protest to do&#8217;t.</LINE>
<LINE>Like workmen, I&#8217;ll example you with thievery:</LINE>
<LINE>The sun&#8217;s a thief, and with his great attraction</LINE>
<LINE>Robs the vast sea; the moon&#8217;s an arrant thief,</LINE>
<LINE>And her pale fire she snatches from the sun;</LINE>
<LINE>The sea&#8217;s a thief, whose liquid surge resolves</LINE>
<LINE>The moon into salt tears; the earth&#8217;s a thief,</LINE>
<LINE>That feeds and breeds by a composture stol&#8217;n</LINE>
<LINE>From gen&#8217;ral excrement; each thing&#8217;s a thief.</LINE>
<LINE>The laws, your curb and whip, in their rough power</LINE>
<LINE>Has uncheck&#8217;d theft. Love not yourselves, away,</LINE>
<LINE>Rob one another. There&#8217;s more gold. Cut throats,</LINE>
<LINE>All that you meet are thieves. To Athens go,</LINE>
<LINE>Break open shops; nothing can you steal</LINE>
<LINE>But thieves do lose it. Steal less for this I give you,</LINE>
<LINE>And gold confound you howsoe&#8217;er! Amen.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>3. BAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>H&#8217;as almost charm&#8217;d me from my profession, by persuading me to it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. BAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis in the malice of mankind that he thus advises us, not to have us thrive in our mystery.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. BAN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll believe him as an enemy, and give over my trade.</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Let us first see peace in Athens. There is no time so miserable but a man may be true.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt Thieves, the Bandits.</STAGEDIR>

<STAGEDIR>Enter the Steward Flavius to Timon.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FLAV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O you gods!</LINE>
<LINE>Is yond despis&#8217;d and ruinous man my lord?</LINE>
<LINE>Full of decay and failing? O monument</LINE>
<LINE>And wonder of good deeds evilly bestow&#8217;d!</LINE>
<LINE>What an alteration of honor has desp&#8217;rate want made!</LINE>
<LINE>What vilder thing upon the earth than friends,</LINE>
<LINE>Who can bring noblest minds to basest ends!</LINE>
<LINE>How rarely does it meet with this time&#8217;s guise,</LINE>
<LINE>When man was wish&#8217;d to love his enemies!</LINE>
<LINE>Grant I may ever love, and rather woo</LINE>
<LINE>Those that would mischief me than those that do!</LINE>
<LINE>H&#8217;as caught me in his eye, I will present</LINE>
<LINE>My honest grief unto him; and as my lord,</LINE>
<LINE>Still serve him with my life. My dearest master!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Away! What art thou?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FLAV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Have you forgot me, sir?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why dost ask that? I have forgot all men.</LINE>
<LINE>Then, if thou grant&#8217;st th&#8217; art a man, I have forgot thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FLAV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>An honest poor servant of yours.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then I know thee not.</LINE>
<LINE>I never had honest man about me, I; all</LINE>
<LINE>I kept were knaves, to serve in meat to villains.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FLAV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The gods are witness,</LINE>
<LINE>Nev&#8217;r did poor steward wear a truer grief</LINE>
<LINE>For his undone lord than mine eyes for you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, dost thou weep? Come nearer. Then I love thee,</LINE>
<LINE>Because thou art a woman, and disclaim&#8217;st</LINE>
<LINE>Flinty mankind, whose eyes do never give</LINE>
<LINE>But thorough lust and laughter. Pity&#8217;s sleeping:</LINE>
<LINE>Strange times, that weep with laughing, not with weeping!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FLAV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I beg of you to know me, good my lord,</LINE>
<LINE>T&#8217; accept my grief, and whilst this poor wealth lasts</LINE>
<LINE>To entertain me as your steward still.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Had I a steward</LINE>
<LINE>So true, so just, and now so comfortable?</LINE>
<LINE>It almost turns my dangerous nature wild.</LINE>
<LINE>Let me behold thy face. Surely, this man</LINE>
<LINE>Was born of woman.</LINE>
<LINE>Forgive my general and exceptless rashness,</LINE>
<LINE>You perpetual-sober gods! I do proclaim</LINE>
<LINE>One honest man&#8212;mistake me not, but one;</LINE>
<LINE>No more, I pray&#8212;and he&#8217;s a steward.</LINE>
<LINE>How fain would I have hated all mankind,</LINE>
<LINE>And thou redeem&#8217;st thyself. But all, save thee,</LINE>
<LINE>I fell with curses.</LINE>
<LINE>Methinks thou art more honest now than wise;</LINE>
<LINE>For, by oppressing and betraying me,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou mightst have sooner got another service;</LINE>
<LINE>For many so arrive at second masters,</LINE>
<LINE>Upon their first lord&#8217;s neck. But tell me true</LINE>
<LINE>(For I must ever doubt, though ne&#8217;er so sure),</LINE>
<LINE>Is not thy kindness subtle, covetous,</LINE>
<LINE>If not a usuring kindness, and, as rich men deal gifts,</LINE>
<LINE>Expecting in return twenty for one?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FLAV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, my most worthy master, in whose breast</LINE>
<LINE>Doubt and suspect, alas, are plac&#8217;d too late;</LINE>
<LINE>You should have fear&#8217;d false times when you did feast:</LINE>
<LINE>Suspect still comes where an estate is least.</LINE>
<LINE>That which I show, heaven knows, is merely love,</LINE>
<LINE>Duty, and zeal to your unmatched mind,</LINE>
<LINE>Care of your food and living; and believe it,</LINE>
<LINE>My most honor&#8217;d lord,</LINE>
<LINE>For any benefit that points to me,</LINE>
<LINE>Either in hope or present, I&#8217;d exchange</LINE>
<LINE>For this one wish, that you had power and wealth</LINE>
<LINE>To requite me by making rich yourself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Look thee, &#8217;tis so. Thou singly honest man,</LINE>
<LINE>Here, take; the gods out of my misery</LINE>
<LINE>Has sent thee treasure. Go, live rich and happy,</LINE>
<LINE>But thus condition&#8217;d: thou shalt build from men;</LINE>
<LINE>Hate all, curse all, show charity to none,</LINE>
<LINE>But let the famish&#8217;d flesh slide from the bone</LINE>
<LINE>Ere thou relieve the beggar. Give to dogs</LINE>
<LINE>What thou deniest to men. Let prisons swallow &#8217;em,</LINE>
<LINE>Debts wither &#8217;em to nothing; be men like blasted woods,</LINE>
<LINE>And may diseases lick up their false bloods!</LINE>
<LINE>And so farewell and thrive.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FLAV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">O, let me stay,</LINE>
<LINE>And comfort you, my master.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">If thou hat&#8217;st curses,</LINE>
<LINE>Stay not; fly, whilst thou art blest and free.</LINE>
<LINE>Ne&#8217;er see thou man, and let me ne&#8217;er see thee.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Poet and Painter; Timon watching them from his cave.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAIN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As I took note of the place, it cannot be far</LINE>
<LINE>Where he abides.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POET.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">What&#8217;s to be thought of him?</LINE>
<LINE>Does the rumor hold for true that he&#8217;s</LINE>
<LINE>So full of gold?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAIN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="3">Certain. Alcibiades reports it;</LINE>
<LINE>Phrynia and Timandra had gold of him.</LINE>
<LINE>He likewise enrich&#8217;d poor straggling soldiers with</LINE>
<LINE>Great quantity. &#8217;Tis said he gave unto</LINE>
<LINE>His steward a mighty sum.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POET.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Then this breaking of his</LINE>
<LINE>Has been but a try for his friends?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAIN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">Nothing else.</LINE>
<LINE>You shall see him a palm in Athens again, and flourish</LINE>
<LINE>With the highest. Therefore, &#8217;tis not amiss</LINE>
<LINE>We tender our loves to him in this suppos&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>Distress of his; it will show honestly in us,</LINE>
<LINE>And is very likely to load our purposes</LINE>
<LINE>With what they travail for, if it be</LINE>
<LINE>A just and true report that goes of his having.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POET.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What have you now to present unto him?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAIN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nothing at this time but my visitation;</LINE>
<LINE>Only I will promise him an excellent piece.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POET.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I must serve him so too: tell him of an intent</LINE>
<LINE>That&#8217;s coming toward him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAIN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Good as the best.</LINE>
<LINE>Promising is the very air o&#8217; th&#8217; time;</LINE>
<LINE>It opens the eyes of expectation.</LINE>
<LINE>Performance is ever the duller for his act,</LINE>
<LINE>And but in the plainer and simpler kind of people</LINE>
<LINE>The deed of saying is quite out of use.</LINE>
<LINE>To promise is most courtly and fashionable;</LINE>
<LINE>Performance is a kind of will or testament</LINE>
<LINE>Which argues a great sickness in his judgment</LINE>
<LINE>That makes it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Timon from his cave.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIM.</SPEAKER>
<STAGEDIR>Aside.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Excellent workman! Thou canst not paint a man</LINE>
<LINE>So bad as is thyself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POET.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">I am thinking</LINE>
<LINE>What I shall say I have provided for him.</LINE>
<LINE>It must be a personating of himself;</LINE>
<LINE>A satire against the softness of prosperity,</LINE>
<LINE>With a discovery of the infinite flatteries</LINE>
<LINE>That follow youth and opulency.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIM.</SPEAKER>
<STAGEDIR>Aside.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE offset="7">Must thou needs</LINE>

<LINE>Wilt thou whip thine own faults in other men?</LINE>
<LINE>Do so, I have gold for thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POET.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Nay, let&#8217;s seek him:</LINE>
<LINE>Then do we sin against our own estate,</LINE>
<LINE>When we may profit meet, and come too late.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAIN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>True:</LINE>
<LINE>When the day serves, before black-corner&#8217;d night,</LINE>

<LINE>Come.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIM.</SPEAKER>
<STAGEDIR>Aside.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll meet you at the turn. What a god&#8217;s gold</LINE>
<LINE>That he is worshipp&#8217;d in a baser temple</LINE>
<LINE>Than where swine feed!</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis thou that rig&#8217;st the bark and plough&#8217;st the foam,</LINE>
<LINE>Settlest admired reverence in a slave.</LINE>
<LINE>To thee be worship, and thy saints for aye</LINE>
<LINE>Be crown&#8217;d with plagues, that thee alone obey!</LINE>
<LINE>Fit I meet them.</LINE>

<LINE>Hail, worthy Timon!</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAIN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Our late noble master!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Have I once liv&#8217;d to see two honest men?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POET.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir,</LINE>
<LINE>Having often of your open bounty tasted,</LINE>
<LINE>Hearing you were retir&#8217;d, your friends fall&#8217;n off,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose thankless natures (O abhorred spirits!)</LINE>
<LINE>Not all the whips of heaven are large enough&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>What, to you,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose star-like nobleness gave life and influence</LINE>
<LINE>To their whole being! I am rapt and cannot cover</LINE>
<LINE>The monstrous bulk of this ingratitude</LINE>
<LINE>With any size of words.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let it go naked, men may see&#8217;t the better.</LINE>
<LINE>You that are honest, by being what you are</LINE>
<LINE>Make them best seen and known.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAIN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">He and myself</LINE>
<LINE>Have travail&#8217;d in the great show&#8217;r of your gifts,</LINE>
<LINE>And sweetly felt it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Ay, you are honest men.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAIN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We are hither come to offer you our service.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Most honest men! Why, how shall I requite you?</LINE>
<LINE>Can you eat roots and drink cold water? No?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BOTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What we can do, we&#8217;ll do, to do you service.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Y&#8217; are honest men; y&#8217; have heard that I have gold,</LINE>
<LINE>I am sure you have. Speak truth, y&#8217; are honest men.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAIN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So it is said, my noble lord, but therefore</LINE>
<LINE>Came not my friend nor I.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good honest men! Thou draw&#8217;st a counterfeit</LINE>
<LINE>Best in all Athens; th&#8217; art indeed the best,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou counterfeit&#8217;st most lively.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEAKER>PAIN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">So, so, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>E&#8217;en so, sir, as I say.&#8212;And, for thy fiction,</LINE>
<LINE>Why, thy verse swells with stuff so fine and smooth</LINE>
<LINE>That thou art even natural in thine art.</LINE>
<LINE>But for all this, my honest-natur&#8217;d friends,</LINE>
<LINE>I must needs say you have a little fault;</LINE>
<LINE>Marry, &#8217;tis not monstrous in you, neither wish I</LINE>
<LINE>You take much pains to mend.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BOTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">Beseech your honor</LINE>
<LINE>To make it known to us.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">You&#8217;ll take it ill.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BOTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Most thankfully, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Will you indeed?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BOTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Doubt it not, worthy lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There&#8217;s never a one of you but trusts a knave</LINE>
<LINE>That mightily deceives you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BOTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Do we, my lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, and you hear him cog, see him dissemble,</LINE>
<LINE>Know his gross patchery, love him, feed him,</LINE>
<LINE>Keep in your bosom; yet remain assur&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>That he&#8217;s a made-up villain.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAIN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know none such, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POET.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Nor I.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Look you, I love you well, I&#8217;ll give you gold,</LINE>
<LINE>Rid me these villains from your companies;</LINE>
<LINE>Hang them, or stab them, drown them in a draught,</LINE>
<LINE>Confound them by some course, and come to me,</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll give you gold enough.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BOTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Name them, my lord, let&#8217;s know them.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You that way and you this; but two in company;</LINE>
<LINE>Each man apart, all single and alone,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet an arch-villain keeps him company.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>To one.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>If where thou art, two villains shall not be,</LINE>
<LINE>Come not near him.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>To the other.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>If thou wouldst not reside</LINE>
<LINE>But where one villain is, then him abandon.&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Hence, pack! There&#8217;s gold; you came for gold, ye slaves.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>To one.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>You have work for me; there&#8217;s payment, hence!</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>To the other.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>You are an alcumist, make gold of that.</LINE>
<LINE>Out, rascal dogs!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt both, driven out by Timon, who retires to his cave.</STAGEDIR>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Steward Flavius and two Senators.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FLAV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is vain that you would speak with Timon;</LINE>
<LINE>For he is set so only to himself,</LINE>
<LINE>That nothing but himself which looks like man</LINE>
<LINE>Is friendly with him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. SEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Bring us to his cave.</LINE>
<LINE>It is our part and promise to th&#8217; Athenians</LINE>
<LINE>To speak with Timon.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. SEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">At all times alike</LINE>
<LINE>Men are not still the same; &#8217;twas time and griefs</LINE>
<LINE>That fram&#8217;d him thus. Time with his fairer hand,</LINE>
<LINE>Offering the fortunes of his former days,</LINE>
<LINE>The former man may make him. Bring us to him,</LINE>

<SPEAKER>TIM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou sun that comforts, burn! Speak and be hang&#8217;d.</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<LINE offset="6">O, forget</LINE>

<LINE>The senators with one consent of love</LINE>
<LINE>Entreat thee back to Athens, who have thought</LINE>
<LINE>On special dignities, which vacant lie,</LINE>
<LINE>For thy best use and wearing.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. SEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">They confess</LINE>

<LINE>A lack of Timon&#8217;s aid, hath sense withal</LINE>
<LINE>Of it own fall, restraining aid to Timon,</LINE>
<LINE>And send forth us to make their sorrowed render,</LINE>
<LINE>Together with a recompense more fruitful</LINE>
<LINE>Than their offense can weigh down by the dram;</LINE>
<LINE>Ay, even such heaps and sums of love and wealth</LINE>
<LINE>As shall to thee blot out what wrongs were theirs,</LINE>
<LINE>And write in thee the figures of their love,</LINE>
<LINE>Ever to read them thine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">You witch me in it;</LINE>
<LINE>Surprise me to the very brink of tears.</LINE>
<LINE>Lend me a fool&#8217;s heart and a woman&#8217;s eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>And I&#8217;ll beweep these comforts, worthy senators.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. SEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Therefore so please thee to return with us,</LINE>
<LINE>And of our Athens, thine and ours, to take</LINE>
<LINE>The captainship, thou shalt be met with thanks,</LINE>
<LINE>Allow&#8217;d with absolute power, and thy good name</LINE>
<LINE>Live with authority; so soon we shall drive back</LINE>
<LINE>Of Alcibiades th&#8217; approaches wild,</LINE>
<LINE>Who, like a boar too savage, doth root up</LINE>
<LINE>His country&#8217;s peace.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. SEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">And shakes his threat&#8217;ning sword</LINE>
<LINE>Against the walls of Athens.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. SEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Therefore, Timon&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, sir, I will; therefore I will, sir, thus:</LINE>
<LINE>If Alcibiades kill my countrymen,</LINE>
<LINE>Let Alcibiades know this of Timon,</LINE>
<LINE>That Timon cares not. But if he sack fair Athens,</LINE>
<LINE>And take our goodly aged men by th&#8217; beards,</LINE>
<LINE>Giving our holy virgins to the stain</LINE>
<LINE>Of contumelious, beastly, mad-brain&#8217;d war,</LINE>
<LINE>Then let him know, and tell him Timon speaks it,</LINE>
<LINE>In pity of our aged and our youth,</LINE>
<LINE>I cannot choose but tell him that I care not,</LINE>
<LINE>And let him take&#8217;t at worst&#8212;for their knives care not,</LINE>
<LINE>While you have throats to answer. For myself,</LINE>
<LINE>There&#8217;s not a whittle in th&#8217; unruly camp</LINE>
<LINE>But I do prize it at my love before</LINE>
<LINE>The reverend&#8217;st throat in Athens. So I leave you</LINE>
<LINE>To the protection of the prosperous gods,</LINE>
<LINE>As thieves to keepers.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FLAV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Stay not, all&#8217;s in vain.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, I was writing of my epitaph;</LINE>
<LINE>It will be seen tomorrow. My long sickness</LINE>
<LINE>Of health and living now begins to mend,</LINE>
<LINE>And nothing brings me all things. Go, live still;</LINE>
<LINE>Be Alcibiades your plague, you his,</LINE>
<LINE>And last so long enough!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. SEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">We speak in vain.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But yet I love my country, and am not</LINE>
<LINE>One that rejoices in the common wrack,</LINE>
<LINE>As common bruit doth put it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. SEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">That&#8217;s well spoke.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Commend me to my loving countrymen&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. SEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>These words become your lips as they pass thorough them.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. SEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And enter in our ears like great triumphers</LINE>
<LINE>In their applauding gates.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Commend me to them,</LINE>
<LINE>And tell them that, to ease them of their griefs,</LINE>
<LINE>Their fears of hostile strokes, their aches, losses,</LINE>
<LINE>Their pangs of love, with other incident throes</LINE>
<LINE>That nature&#8217;s fragile vessel doth sustain</LINE>
<LINE>In life&#8217;s uncertain voyage, I will some kindness do them:</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll teach them to prevent wild Alcibiades&#8217; wrath.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. SEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I like this well, he will return again.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have a tree, which grows here in my close,</LINE>
<LINE>That mine own use invites me to cut down,</LINE>
<LINE>And shortly must I fell it. Tell my friends,</LINE>
<LINE>Tell Athens, in the sequence of degree,</LINE>
<LINE>From high to low throughout, that whoso please</LINE>
<LINE>To stop affliction, let him take his haste,</LINE>
<LINE>Come hither, ere my tree hath felt the axe,</LINE>
<LINE>And hang himself. I pray you do my greeting.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FLAV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Trouble him no further, thus you still shall find him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TIM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come not to me again, but say to Athens,</LINE>
<LINE>Timon hath made his everlasting mansion</LINE>
<LINE>Upon the beached verge of the salt flood,</LINE>
<LINE>Who once a day with his embossed froth</LINE>
<LINE>The turbulent surge shall cover; thither come,</LINE>
<LINE>And let my grave-stone be your oracle.</LINE>
<LINE>Lips, let four words go by and language end!</LINE>
<LINE>What is amiss, plague and infection mend!</LINE>
<LINE>Graves only be men&#8217;s works, and death their gain!</LINE>
<LINE>Sun, hide thy beams, Timon hath done his reign.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit Timon.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. SEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>His discontents are unremovably</LINE>
<LINE>Coupled to nature.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. SEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Our hope in him is dead. Let us return,</LINE>
<LINE>And strain what other means is left unto us</LINE>
<LINE>In our dear peril.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MESS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I met a courier, one mine ancient friend,</LINE>
<LINE>Whom, though in general part we were oppos&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet our old love made a particular force,</LINE>
<LINE>And made us speak like friends. This man was riding</LINE>
<LINE>From Alcibiades to Timon&#8217;s cave</LINE>
<LINE>With letters of entreaty, which imported</LINE>
<LINE>His fellowship i&#8217; th&#8217; cause against your city,</LINE>

<LINE>Dead, sure, and this his grave. What&#8217;s on this tomb</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Trumpets sound. Enter Alcibiades with his powers before Athens.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALCIB.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sound to this coward and lascivious town</LINE>
<LINE>Our terrible approach.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Sounds a parley.</STAGEDIR>
<STAGEDIR>The Senators appear upon the walls.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Till now you have gone on and fill&#8217;d the time</LINE>
<LINE>With all licentious measure, making your wills</LINE>
<LINE>The scope of justice; till now myself and such</LINE>
<LINE>As slept within the shadow of your power</LINE>
<LINE>Have wander&#8217;d with our travers&#8217;d arms, and breath&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>Our sufferance vainly. Now the time is flush,</LINE>
<LINE>When crouching marrow in the bearer strong</LINE>
<LINE>Cries (of itself) &#8220;No more!&#8221; Now breathless wrong</LINE>
<LINE>Shall sit and pant in your great chairs of ease,</LINE>
<LINE>And pursy insolence shall break his wind</LINE>
<LINE>With fear and horrid flight.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. SEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Noble and young&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>When thy first griefs were but a mere conceit,</LINE>
<LINE>Ere thou hadst power or we had cause of fear,</LINE>
<LINE>We sent to thee to give thy rages balm,</LINE>
<LINE>To wipe out our ingratitude with loves</LINE>
<LINE>Above their quantity.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. SEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">So did we woo</LINE>
<LINE>Transformed Timon to our city&#8217;s love</LINE>
<LINE>By humble message and by promis&#8217;d means.</LINE>
<LINE>We were not all unkind, nor all deserve</LINE>
<LINE>The common stroke of war.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. SEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">These walls of ours</LINE>
<LINE>Were not erected by their hands from whom</LINE>
<LINE>You have receiv&#8217;d your grief; nor are they such</LINE>
<LINE>That these great tow&#8217;rs, trophies, and schools should fall</LINE>
<LINE>For private faults in them.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. SEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Nor are they living</LINE>
<LINE>Who were the motives that you first went out;</LINE>
<LINE>Shame, that they wanted cunning in excess,</LINE>
<LINE>Hath broke their hearts. March, noble lord,</LINE>
<LINE>Into our city with thy banners spread;</LINE>
<LINE>By decimation, and a tithed death,</LINE>
<LINE>If thy revenges hunger for that food</LINE>
<LINE>Which nature loathes, take thou the destin&#8217;d tenth,</LINE>
<LINE>And by the hazard of the spotted die</LINE>
<LINE>Let die the spotted.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. SEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">All have not offended;</LINE>
<LINE>For those that were, it is not square to take</LINE>
<LINE>On those that are, revenge; crimes, like lands,</LINE>
<LINE>Are not inherited. Then, dear countryman,</LINE>
<LINE>Bring in thy ranks, but leave without thy rage;</LINE>
<LINE>Spare thy Athenian cradle and those kin</LINE>
<LINE>Which in the bluster of thy wrath must fall</LINE>
<LINE>With those that have offended; like a shepherd,</LINE>
<LINE>Approach the fold and cull th&#8217; infected forth,</LINE>
<LINE>But kill not all together.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. SEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">What thou wilt,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou rather shalt enforce it with thy smile</LINE>
<LINE>Than hew to&#8217;t with thy sword.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. SEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">Set but thy foot</LINE>
<LINE>Against our rampir&#8217;d gates and they shall ope,</LINE>
<LINE>So thou wilt send thy gentle heart before,</LINE>
<LINE>To say thou&#8217;t enter friendly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. SEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Throw thy glove,</LINE>

<LINE>Those enemies of Timon&#8217;s and mine own</LINE>
<LINE>Whom you yourselves shall set out for reproof</LINE>
<LINE>Fall, and no more; and to atone your fears</LINE>
<LINE>With my more noble meaning, not a man</LINE>
<LINE>Shall pass his quarter, or offend the stream</LINE>
<LINE>Of regular justice in your city&#8217;s bounds,</LINE>
<LINE>But shall be remedied to your public laws</LINE>
<LINE>At heaviest answer.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>My noble general, Timon is dead,</LINE>
<LINE>Entomb&#8217;d upon the very hem o&#8217; th&#8217; sea,</LINE>
<LINE>And on his grave-stone this insculpture, which</LINE>
<LINE>With wax I brought away, whose soft impression</LINE>
<LINE>Interprets for my poor ignorance.</LINE>

<LINE><RECITE>Pass by and curse thy fill, but pass and stay not here thy gait.&#8221;</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE>These well express in thee thy latter spirits:</LINE>
<LINE>Though thou abhorr&#8217;dst in us our human griefs,</LINE>
<LINE>Scorn&#8217;dst our brains&#8217; flow, and those our droplets which</LINE>
<LINE>From niggard nature fall, yet rich conceit</LINE>
<LINE>Taught thee to make vast Neptune weep for aye</LINE>
<LINE>On thy low grave, on faults forgiven. Dead</LINE>
<LINE>Is noble Timon, of whose memory</LINE>
<LINE>Hereafter more. Bring me into your city,</LINE>
<LINE>And I will use the olive with my sword:</LINE>
<LINE>Make war breed peace, make peace stint war, make each</LINE>
<LINE>Prescribe to other as each other&#8217;s leech.</LINE>
<LINE>Let our drums strike.</LINE>
