<stagedir>Enter Poet, Painter, Jeweller, Merchant, at several doors.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>POET.</speaker>
<line>Good day, sir.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAIN.</speaker>
<line offset="3">I am glad y&#8217; are well.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POET.</speaker>
<line>I have not seen you long, how goes the world?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAIN.</speaker>
<line>It wears, sir, as it grows.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POET.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Ay, that&#8217;s well known;</line>
<line>But what particular rarity? What strange,</line>
<line>Which manifold record not matches? See,</line>
<line>Magic of bounty! All these spirits thy power</line>
<line>Hath conjur&#8217;d to attend. I know the merchant.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAIN.</speaker>
<line>I know them both; th&#8217; other&#8217;s a jeweller.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MER.</speaker>
<line>O, &#8217;tis a worthy lord.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JEW.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Nay, that&#8217;s most fix&#8217;d.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MER.</speaker>
<line>A most incomparable man, breath&#8217;d, as it were,</line>
<line>To an untirable and continuate goodness;</line>
<line>He passes.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JEW.</speaker>
<line>I have a jewel here&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MER.</speaker>
<line>O, pray let&#8217;s see&#8217;t. For the Lord Timon, sir?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JEW.</speaker>
<line>If he will touch the estimate. But for that&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POET.</speaker>
<stagedir>Reciting to himself.</stagedir>
<line>&#8220;When we for recompense have prais&#8217;d the vild,</line>
<line>It stains the glory in that happy verse</line>
<line>Which aptly sings the good.&#8221;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MER.</speaker>
<stagedir>Looking on the jewel.</stagedir>
<line offset="6">&#8217;Tis a good form.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JEW.</speaker>
<line>And rich. Here is a water, look ye.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAIN.</speaker>
<line>You are rapt, sir, in some work, some dedication</line>
<line>To the great lord.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POET.</speaker>
<line offset="4">A thing slipp&#8217;d idlely from me.</line>
<line>Our poesy is as a gum, which oozes</line>
<line>From whence &#8217;tis nourish&#8217;d. The fire i&#8217; th&#8217; flint</line>
<line>Shows not till it be strook; our gentle flame</line>
<line>Provokes itself and like the current flies</line>
<line>Each bound it chases. What have you there?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAIN.</speaker>
<line>A picture, sir. When comes your book forth?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POET.</speaker>
<line>Upon the heels of my presentment, sir.</line>
<line>Let&#8217;s see your piece.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAIN.</speaker>
<line offset="4">&#8217;Tis a good piece.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POET.</speaker>
<line>So &#8217;tis. This comes off well and excellent.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAIN.</speaker>
<line>Indifferent.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POET.</speaker>
<line offset="3">Admirable! How this grace</line>
<line>Speaks his own standing! What a mental power</line>
<line>This eye shoots forth! How big imagination</line>
<line>Moves in this lip! To th&#8217; dumbness of the gesture</line>
<line>One might interpret.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAIN.</speaker>
<line>It is a pretty mocking of the life.</line>
<line>Here is a touch; is&#8217;t good?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POET.</speaker>
<line offset="5">I will say of it,</line>
<line>It tutors nature. Artificial strife</line>
<line>Lives in these touches, livelier than life.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter certain Senators and pass over.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>PAIN.</speaker>
<line>How this lord is followed!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POET.</speaker>
<line>The senators of Athens, happy men!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAIN.</speaker>
<line>Look, more!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POET.</speaker>
<line>You see this confluence, this great flood of visitors.</line>
<line>I have, in this rough work, shap&#8217;d out a man</line>
<line>Whom this beneath world doth embrace and hug</line>
<line>With amplest entertainment. My free drift</line>
<line>Halts not particularly, but moves itself</line>
<line>In a wide sea of wax; no levell&#8217;d malice</line>
<line>Infects one comma in the course I hold,</line>
<line>But flies an eagle flight, bold, and forth on,</line>
<line>Leaving no tract behind.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAIN.</speaker>
<line>How shall I understand you?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POET.</speaker>
<line offset="6">I will unbolt to you.</line>
<line>You see how all conditions, how all minds,</line>
<line>As well of glib and slipp&#8217;ry creatures as</line>
<line>Of grave and austere quality, tender down</line>
<line>Their services to Lord Timon. His large fortune,</line>
<line>Upon his good and gracious nature hanging,</line>
<line>Subdues and properties to his love and tendance</line>
<line>All sorts of hearts; yea, from the glass-fac&#8217;d flatterer</line>
<line>To Apemantus, that few things loves better</line>
<line>Than to abhor himself; even he drops down</line>
<line>The knee before him, and returns in peace</line>
<line>Most rich in Timon&#8217;s nod.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAIN.</speaker>
<line offset="5">I saw them speak together.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POET.</speaker>
<line>Sir, I have upon a high and pleasant hill</line>
<line>Feign&#8217;d Fortune to be thron&#8217;d. The base o&#8217; th&#8217; mount</line>
<line>Is rank&#8217;d with all deserts, all kind of natures,</line>
<line>That labor on the bosom of this sphere</line>
<line>To propagate their states. Amongst them all,</line>
<line>Whose eyes are on this sovereign lady fix&#8217;d,</line>
<line>One do I personate of Lord Timon&#8217;s frame,</line>
<line>Whom Fortune with her ivory hand wafts to her,</line>
<line>Whose present grace to present slaves and servants</line>
<line>Translates his rivals.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAIN.</speaker>
<line offset="4">&#8217;Tis conceiv&#8217;d to scope.</line>
<line>This throne, this Fortune, and this hill, methinks,</line>
<line>With one man beckon&#8217;d from the rest below,</line>
<line>Bowing his head against the steepy mount</line>
<line>To climb his happiness, would be well express&#8217;d</line>
<line>In our condition.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POET.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Nay, sir, but hear me on:</line>
<line>All those which were his fellows but of late&#8212;</line>
<line>Some better than his value&#8212;on the moment</line>
<line>Follow his strides, his lobbies fill with tendance,</line>
<line>Rain sacrificial whisperings in his ear,</line>
<line>Make sacred even his stirrup, and through him</line>
<line>Drink the free air.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAIN.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Ay, marry, what of these?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POET.</speaker>
<line>When Fortune in her shift and change of mood</line>
<line>Spurns down her late beloved, all his dependants</line>
<line>Which labor&#8217;d after him to the mountain&#8217;s top</line>
<line>Even on their knees and hands, let him slip down,</line>
<line>Not one accompanying his declining foot.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAIN.</speaker>
<line>&#8217;Tis common:</line>
<line>A thousand moral paintings I can show</line>
<line>That shall demonstrate these quick blows of Fortune&#8217;s</line>
<line>More pregnantly than words. Yet you do well</line>
<line>To show Lord Timon that mean eyes have seen</line>
<line>The foot above the head.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Trumpets sound. Enter Lord Timon, addressing himself courteously to every suitor, a Messenger from Ventidius talking with him; Lucilius and other Servants following.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Imprison&#8217;d is he, say you?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MESS. VENT.</speaker>
<line>Ay, my good lord, five talents is his debt,</line>
<line>His means most short, his creditors most strait.</line>
<line>Your honorable letter he desires</line>
<line>To those have shut him up, which failing,</line>
<line>Periods his comfort.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Noble Ventidius! Well;</line>
<line>I am not of that feather to shake off</line>
<line>My friend when he must need me. I do know him</line>
<line>A gentleman that well deserves a help,</line>
<line>Which he shall have. I&#8217;ll pay the debt and free him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MESS. VENT.</speaker>
<line>Your lordship ever binds him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line>Commend me to him. I will send his ransom,</line>
<line>And being enfranchis&#8217;d, bid him come to me;</line>
<line>&#8217;Tis not enough to help the feeble up,</line>
<line>But to support him after. Fare you well.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MESS. VENT.</speaker>
<line>All happiness to your honor!</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit.</stagedir>

<stagedir>Enter an Old Athenian.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>OLD ATH.</speaker>
<line>Lord Timon, hear me speak.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line offset="6">Freely, good father.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OLD ATH.</speaker>
<line>Thou hast a servant nam&#8217;d Lucilius.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line>I have so. What of him?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OLD ATH.</speaker>
<line>Most noble Timon, call the man before thee.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line>Attends he here, or no? Lucilius!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LUCIL.</speaker>
<line>Here, at your lordship&#8217;s service.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OLD ATH.</speaker>
<line>This fellow here, Lord Timon, this thy creature,</line>
<line>By night frequents my house. I am a man</line>
<line>That from my first have been inclin&#8217;d to thrift,</line>
<line>And my estate deserves an heir more rais&#8217;d</line>
<line>Than one which holds a trencher.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line offset="7">Well; what further?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OLD ATH.</speaker>
<line>One only daughter have I, no kin else,</line>
<line>On whom I may confer what I have got.</line>
<line>The maid is fair, a&#8217; th&#8217; youngest for a bride,</line>
<line>And I have bred her at my dearest cost</line>
<line>In qualities of the best. This man of thine</line>
<line>Attempts her love. I prithee, noble lord,</line>
<line>Join with me to forbid him her resort,</line>
<line>Myself have spoke in vain.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line offset="5">The man is honest.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OLD ATH.</speaker>
<line>Therefore he will be, Timon.</line>
<line>His honesty rewards him in itself,</line>
<line>It must not bear my daughter.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line offset="6">Does she love him?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OLD ATH.</speaker>
<line>She is young and apt.</line>
<line>Our own precedent passions do instruct us</line>
<line>What levity&#8217;s in youth.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<stagedir>To Lucilius.</stagedir>
<line offset="5">Love you the maid?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LUCIL.</speaker>
<line>Ay, my good lord, and she accepts of it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OLD ATH.</speaker>
<line>If in her marriage my consent be missing,</line>
<line>I call the gods to witness, I will choose</line>
<line>Mine heir from forth the beggars of the world,</line>
<line>And dispossess her all.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line offset="4">How shall she be endowed,</line>
<line>If she be mated with an equal husband?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OLD ATH.</speaker>
<line>Three talents on the present; in future, all.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line>This gentleman of mine hath serv&#8217;d me long;</line>
<line>To build his fortune I will strain a little,</line>
<line>For &#8217;tis a bond in men. Give him thy daughter;</line>
<line>What you bestow, in him I&#8217;ll counterpoise,</line>
<line>And make him weigh with her.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OLD ATH.</speaker>
<line offset="6">Most noble lord,</line>
<line>Pawn me to this your honor, she is his.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line>My hand to thee, mine honor on my promise.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LUCIL.</speaker>
<line>Humbly I thank your lordship. Never may</line>
<line>That state or fortune fall into my keeping,</line>
<line>Which is not owed to you!</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit with Old Athenian.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>POET.</speaker>
<line>Vouchsafe my labor, and long live your lordship!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line>I thank you, you shall hear from me anon.</line>
<line>Go not away. What have you there, my friend?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAIN.</speaker>
<line>A piece of painting, which I do beseech</line>
<line>Your lordship to accept.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Painting is welcome.</line>
<line>The painting is almost the natural man;</line>
<line>For since dishonor traffics with man&#8217;s nature,</line>
<line>He is but outside; these pencill&#8217;d figures are</line>
<line>Even such as they give out. I like your work,</line>
<line>And you shall find I like it. Wait attendance</line>
<line>Till you hear further from me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAIN.</speaker>
<line offset="6">The gods preserve ye!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line>Well fare you, gentleman; give me your hand,</line>
<line>We must needs dine together.&#8212;Sir, your jewel</line>
<line>Hath suffered under praise.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JEW.</speaker>
<line offset="5">What, my lord, dispraise?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line>A mere saciety of commendations;</line>
<line>If I should pay you for&#8217;t as &#8217;tis extoll&#8217;d,</line>
<line>It would unclew me quite.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JEW.</speaker>
<line offset="5">My lord, &#8217;tis rated</line>
<line>As those which sell would give; but you well know,</line>
<line>Things of like value differing in the owners</line>
<line>Are prized by their masters. Believe&#8217;t, dear lord,</line>
<line>You mend the jewel by the wearing it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line>Well mock&#8217;d.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Apemantus.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>MER.</speaker>
<line>No, my good lord, he speaks the common tongue</line>
<line>Which all men speak with him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line>Look who comes here; will you be chid?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JEW.</speaker>
<line>We&#8217;ll bear, with your lordship.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MER.</speaker>
<line offset="6">He&#8217;ll spare none.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line>Good morrow to thee, gentle Apemantus!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>APEM.</speaker>
<line>Till I be gentle, stay thou for thy good morrow&#8212;</line>
<line>When thou art Timon&#8217;s dog, and these knaves honest.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line>Why dost thou call them knaves? Thou know&#8217;st them not.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>APEM.</speaker>
<line>Are they not Athenians?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line>Yes.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>APEM.</speaker>
<line>Then I repent not.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JEW.</speaker>
<line>You know me, Apemantus?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>APEM.</speaker>
<line>Thou know&#8217;st I do, I call&#8217;d thee by thy name.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line>Thou art proud, Apemantus.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>APEM.</speaker>
<line>Of nothing so much as that I am not like Timon.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line>Whither art going?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>APEM.</speaker>
<line>To knock out an honest Athenian&#8217;s brains.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line>That&#8217;s a deed thou&#8217;t die for.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>APEM.</speaker>
<line>Right, if doing nothing be death by th&#8217; law.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line>How lik&#8217;st thou this picture, Apemantus?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>APEM.</speaker>
<line>The best, for the innocence.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line>Wrought he not well that painted it?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>APEM.</speaker>
<line>He wrought better that made the painter, and yet he&#8217;s but a filthy piece of work.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAIN.</speaker>
<line>Y&#8217; are a dog.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>APEM.</speaker>
<line>Thy mother&#8217;s of my generation; what&#8217;s she, if I be a dog?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line>Wilt dine with me, Apemantus?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>APEM.</speaker>
<line>No; I eat not lords.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line>And thou shouldst, thou&#8217;dst anger ladies.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>APEM.</speaker>
<line>O, they eat lords; so they come by great bellies.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line>That&#8217;s a lascivious apprehension.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>APEM.</speaker>
<line>So thou apprehend&#8217;st it, take it for thy labor.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line>How dost thou like this jewel, Apemantus?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>APEM.</speaker>
<line>Not so well as plain-dealing, which will not cast a man a doit.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line>What dost thou think &#8217;tis worth?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>APEM.</speaker>
<line>Not worth my thinking. How now, poet?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POET.</speaker>
<line>How now, philosopher?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>APEM.</speaker>
<line>Thou liest.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POET.</speaker>
<line>Art not one?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>APEM.</speaker>
<line>Yes.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POET.</speaker>
<line>Then I lie not.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>APEM.</speaker>
<line>Art not a poet?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POET.</speaker>
<line>Yes.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>APEM.</speaker>
<line>Then thou liest: look in thy last work, where thou hast feign&#8217;d him a worthy fellow.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POET.</speaker>
<line>That&#8217;s not feign&#8217;d, he is so.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>APEM.</speaker>
<line>Yes, he is worthy of thee, and to pay thee for thy labor. He that loves to be flatter&#8217;d is worthy o&#8217; th&#8217; flatterer. Heavens, that I were a lord!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line>What wouldst do then, Apemantus?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>APEM.</speaker>
<line>E&#8217;en as Apemantus does now: hate a lord with my heart.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line>What, thyself?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>APEM.</speaker>
<line>Ay.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line>Wherefore?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>APEM.</speaker>
<line>That I had no angry wit to be a lord. Art not thou a merchant?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MER.</speaker>
<line>Ay, Apemantus.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>APEM.</speaker>
<line>Traffic confound thee, if the gods will not!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MER.</speaker>
<line>If traffic do it, the gods do it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>APEM.</speaker>
<line>Traffic&#8217;s thy god, and thy god confound thee!</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Trumpet sounds. Enter a Messenger.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line>What trumpet&#8217;s that?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MESS.</speaker>
<line>&#8217;Tis Alcibiades, and some twenty horse,</line>
<line>All of companionship.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line>Pray entertain them, give them guide to us.</line>

<stagedir>Exeunt some Attendants.</stagedir>
<line>You must needs dine with me; go not you hence</line>
<line>Till I have thank&#8217;d you. When dinner&#8217;s done,</line>
<line>Show me this piece. I am joyful of your sights.</line>

<stagedir>Enter Alcibiades with the rest.</stagedir>
<line>Most welcome, sir!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>APEM.</speaker>
<line offset="4">So, so; there!</line>
<line>Aches contract and starve your supple joints!</line>
<line>That there should be small love amongest these sweet knaves,</line>
<line>And all this courtesy! The strain of man&#8217;s bred out</line>
<line>Into baboon and monkey.</line>
</speech>

<line>Sir, you have sav&#8217;d my longing, and I feed</line>
<line>Most hungerly on your sight.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line offset="6">Right welcome, sir!</line>
<line>Ere we depart, we&#8217;ll share a bounteous time</line>
<line>In different pleasures. Pray you let us in.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exeunt all but Apemantus.</stagedir>

<stagedir>Enter two Lords.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>1. LORD.</speaker>
<line>What time a&#8217; day is&#8217;t, Apemantus?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>APEM.</speaker>
<line>Time to be honest.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. LORD.</speaker>
<line>That time serves still.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>APEM.</speaker>
<line>The most accursed thou, that still omit&#8217;st it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. LORD.</speaker>
<line>Thou art going to Lord Timon&#8217;s feast?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>APEM.</speaker>
<line>Ay, to see meat fill knaves, and wine heat fools.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. LORD.</speaker>
<line>Fare thee well, fare thee well.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>APEM.</speaker>
<line>Thou art a fool to bid me farewell twice.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. LORD.</speaker>
<line>Why, Apemantus?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>APEM.</speaker>
<line>Shouldst have kept one to thyself, for I mean to give thee none.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. LORD.</speaker>
<line>Hang thyself!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>APEM.</speaker>
<line>No, I will do nothing at thy bidding; make thy requests to thy friend.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. LORD.</speaker>
<line>Away, unpeaceable dog, or I&#8217;ll spurn thee hence!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>APEM.</speaker>
<line>I will fly, like a dog, the heels a&#8217; th&#8217; ass.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>1. LORD.</speaker>
<line>He&#8217;s opposite to humanity. Come, shall we in</line>
<line>And taste Lord Timon&#8217;s bounty? He outgoes</line>
<line>The very heart of kindness.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. LORD.</speaker>
<line>He pours it out: Plutus, the god of gold,</line>
<line>Is but his steward. No meed but he repays</line>
<line>Sevenfold above itself; no gift to him</line>
<line>But breeds the giver a return exceeding</line>
<line>All use of quittance.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. LORD.</speaker>
<line offset="4">The noblest mind he carries</line>
<line>That ever govern&#8217;d man.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. LORD.</speaker>
<line>Long may he live in fortunes! Shall we in?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. LORD.</speaker>
<line>I&#8217;ll keep you company.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exeunt.</stagedir>

<scenetitle>Scene 2</scenetitle>
<scenelocation>A banqueting-room in Timon&#8217;s house.</scenelocation>
<scenepersonae>(Flavius, Lord Timon, States, Athenian Lords, Alcibiades, Ventidius, Apemantus, Servants, Cupid, Ladies)</scenepersonae>

<stagedir>Hoboys playing loud music. A great banquet serv&#8217;d in, Flavius and others attending; and then enter Lord Timon, the States, the Athenian Lords, Alcibiades, and Ventidius, which Timon redeem&#8217;d from prison. Then comes, dropping after all, Apemantus, discontentedly, like himself.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>VEN.</speaker>
<line>Most honored Timon,</line>
<line>It hath pleas&#8217;d the gods to remember my father&#8217;s age,</line>
<line>And call him to long peace.</line>
<line>He is gone happy, and has left me rich.</line>
<line>Then, as in grateful virtue I am bound</line>
<line>To your free heart, I do return those talents,</line>
<line>Doubled with thanks and service, from whose help</line>
<line>I deriv&#8217;d liberty.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line offset="3">O, by no means,</line>
<line>Honest Ventidius. You mistake my love;</line>
<line>I gave it freely ever, and there&#8217;s none</line>
<line>Can truly say he gives if he receives.</line>
<line>If our betters play at that game, we must not dare</line>
<line>To imitate them; faults that are rich are fair.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VEN.</speaker>
<line>A noble spirit!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line offset="3">Nay, my lords,</line>
<line>Ceremony was but devis&#8217;d at first</line>
<line>To set a gloss on faint deeds, hollow welcomes,</line>
<line>Recanting goodness, sorry ere &#8217;tis shown;</line>
<line>But where there is true friendship, there needs none.</line>
<line>Pray sit, more welcome are ye to my fortunes</line>
<line>Than my fortunes to me.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>They sit.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>1. LORD.</speaker>
<line>My lord, we always have confess&#8217;d it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>APEM.</speaker>
<line>Ho, ho, confess&#8217;d it? Hang&#8217;d it, have you not?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line>O, Apemantus, you are welcome.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>APEM.</speaker>
<line offset="7">No;</line>
<line>You shall not make me welcome.</line>
<line>I come to have thee thrust me out of doors.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line>Fie, th&#8217; art a churl. Ye have got a humor there</line>
<line>Does not become a man, &#8217;tis much to blame.</line>
<line>They say, my lords, &#8220;<latin xml:lang="la">Ira furor brevis est</latin>,&#8221;</line>
<line>But yond man is very angry. Go,</line>
<line>Let him have a table by himself,</line>
<line>For he does neither affect company,</line>
<line>Nor is he fit for&#8217;t indeed.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>APEM.</speaker>
<line>Let me stay at thine apperil, Timon.</line>
<line>I come to observe, I give thee warning on&#8217;t.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line>I take no heed of thee; th&#8217; art an Athenian, therefore welcome. I myself would have no power; prithee let my meat make thee silent.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>APEM.</speaker>
<line>I scorn thy meat, &#8217;twould choke me; for I should ne&#8217;er flatter thee. O you gods! What a number of men eats Timon, and he sees &#8217;em not! It grieves me to see so many dip their meat in one man&#8217;s blood, and all the madness is, he cheers them up too.</line>
<line>I wonder men dare trust themselves with men.</line>
<line>Methinks they should invite them without knives:</line>
<line>Good for their meat, and safer for their lives.</line>
<line>There&#8217;s much example for&#8217;t: the fellow that sits next him, now parts bread with him, pledges the breath of him in a divided draught, is the readiest man to kill him; &#8217;t &#8217;as been prov&#8217;d. If I were a huge man, I should fear to drink at meals,</line>
<line>Lest they should spy my windpipe&#8217;s dangerous notes:</line>
<line>Great men should drink with harness on their throats.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line>My lord, in heart; and let the health go round.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. LORD.</speaker>
<line>Let it flow this way, my good lord.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>APEM.</speaker>
<line>Flow this way? A brave fellow! He keeps his tides well. Those healths will make thee and thy state look ill, Timon.</line>
<line>Here&#8217;s that which is too weak to be a sinner,</line>
<line>Honest water, which ne&#8217;er left man i&#8217; th&#8217; mire.</line>
<line>This and my food are equals, there&#8217;s no odds;</line>
<line>Feasts are too proud to give thanks to the gods.</line>

<stagedir>Apemantus&#8217; grace.</stagedir>
<line><RECITE>Immortal gods, I crave no pelf,</RECITE></line>
<line><RECITE>I pray for no man but myself.</RECITE></line>
<line><RECITE>Grant I may never prove so fond,</RECITE></line>
<line><RECITE>To trust man on his oath or bond;</RECITE></line>
<line><RECITE>Or a harlot for her weeping,</RECITE></line>
<line><RECITE>Or a dog that seems a-sleeping,</RECITE></line>
<line><RECITE>Or a keeper with my freedom,</RECITE></line>
<line><RECITE>Or my friends, if I should need &#8217;em.</RECITE></line>
<line><RECITE>Amen. So fall to&#8217;t:</RECITE></line>
<line><RECITE>Rich men sin, and I eat root.</RECITE></line>

<stagedir>Eats and drinks.</stagedir>
<line>Much good dich thy good heart, Apemantus!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line>Captain Alcibiades, your heart&#8217;s in the field now.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ALCIB.</speaker>
<line>My heart is ever at your service, my lord.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line>You had rather be at a breakfast of enemies than a dinner of friends.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ALCIB.</speaker>
<line>So they were bleeding new, my lord, there&#8217;s no meat like &#8217;em; I could wish my best friend at such a feast.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>APEM.</speaker>
<line>Would all those flatterers were thine enemies then, that then thou mightst kill &#8217;em&#8212;and bid me to &#8217;em!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. LORD.</speaker>
<line>Might we but have that happiness, my lord, that you would once use our hearts, whereby we might express some part of our zeals, we should think ourselves forever perfect.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line>O, no doubt, my good friends, but the gods themselves have provided that I shall have much help from you: how had you been my friends else? Why have you that charitable title from thousands, did not you chiefly belong to my heart? I have told more of you to myself than you can with modesty speak in your own behalf; and thus far I confirm you. O you gods, think I, what need we have any friends, if we should ne&#8217;er have need of &#8217;em? They were the most needless creatures living, should we ne&#8217;er have use for &#8217;em; and would most resemble sweet instruments hung up in cases, that keeps their sounds to themselves. Why, I have often wish&#8217;d myself poorer, that I might come nearer to you. We are born to do benefits; and what better or properer can we call our own than the riches of our friends? O, what a precious comfort &#8217;tis to have so many like brothers commanding one another&#8217;s fortunes! O, joy&#8217;s e&#8217;en made away ere&#8217;t can be born! Mine eyes cannot hold out water, methinks. To forget their faults, I drink to you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>APEM.</speaker>
<line>Thou weep&#8217;st to make them drink, Timon.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. LORD.</speaker>
<line>Joy had the like conception in our eyes,</line>
<line>And at that instant like a babe sprung up.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>APEM.</speaker>
<line>Ho, ho! I laugh to think that babe a bastard.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>3. LORD.</speaker>
<line>I promise you, my lord, you mov&#8217;d me much.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>APEM.</speaker>
<line>Much!</line>

<stagedir>Enter Timon&#8217;s First Servant.</stagedir>
<line offset="5">How now?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. TIM. SERV.</speaker>
<line>Please you, my lord, there are certain ladies most desirous of admittance.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line>Ladies? What are their wills?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. TIM. SERV.</speaker>
<line>There comes with them a forerunner, my lord, which bears that office to signify their pleasures.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line>I pray let them be admitted.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit Timon&#8217;s First Servant.</stagedir>

<stagedir>Enter Cupid.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>CUP.</speaker>
<line>Hail to thee, worthy Timon, and to all</line>
<line>That of his bounties taste! The five best senses</line>
<line>Acknowledge thee their patron, and come freely</line>
<line>To gratulate thy plenteous bosom. There,</line>
<line>Taste, touch, all, pleas&#8217;d from thy table rise;</line>
<line>They only now come but to feast thine eyes.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line>They&#8217;re welcome all, let &#8217;em have kind admittance.</line>
<line>Music, make their welcome!</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit Cupid.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>1. LORD.</speaker>
<line>You see, my lord, how ample y&#8217; are belov&#8217;d.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Music. Enter Cupid with the masque of Ladies, as Amazons, with lutes in their hands, dancing and playing.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>APEM.</speaker>
<line>Hoy-day,</line>
<line>What a sweep of vanity comes this way!</line>
<line>They dance? They are madwomen.</line>
<line>Like madness is the glory of this life,</line>
<line>As this pomp shows to a little oil and root.</line>
<line>We make ourselves fools to disport ourselves,</line>
<line>And spend our flatteries to drink those men</line>
<line>Upon whose age we void it up again</line>
<line>With poisonous spite and envy.</line>
<line>Who lives that&#8217;s not depraved or depraves?</line>
<line>Who dies that bears not one spurn to their graves</line>
<line>Of their friends&#8217; gift?</line>
<line>I should fear those that dance before me now</line>
<line>Would one day stamp upon me. &#8217;T &#8217;as been done;</line>
<line>Men shut their doors against a setting sun.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>The Lords rise from table, with much adoring of Timon, and to show their loves, each single out an Amazon, and all dance, men with women, a lofty strain or two to the hoboys, and cease.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line>You have done our pleasures much grace, fair ladies,</line>
<line>Set a fair fashion on our entertainment,</line>
<line>Which was not half so beautiful and kind;</line>
<line>You have added worth unto&#8217;t and lustre,</line>
<line>And entertain&#8217;d me with mine own device.</line>
<line>I am to thank you for&#8217;t.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. LADY. MASK.</speaker>
<line>My lord, you take us even at the best.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>APEM.</speaker>
<line>Faith, for the worst is filthy, and would not hold taking, I doubt me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line>Ladies, there is an idle banquet attends you,</line>
<line>Please you to dispose yourselves.</line>
</speech>

<line>Yes, my lord.</line>

<stagedir>Aside.</stagedir>
<line offset="3">More jewels yet?</line>
<line>There is no crossing him in &#8217;s humor,</line>
<line>Else I should tell him well (i&#8217; faith, I should),</line>
<line>When all&#8217;s spent, he&#8217;ld be cross&#8217;d then, and he could.</line>
<line>&#8217;Tis pity bounty had not eyes behind,</line>
<line>That man might ne&#8217;er be wretched for his mind.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit. Enter Timon&#8217;s First Servant.</stagedir>

<line>I prithee let&#8217;s be provided to show them entertainment.</line>

<line>Please you, my lord, that honorable gentleman, Lord Lucullus, entreats your company tomorrow to hunt with him, and has sent your honor two brace of greyhounds.</line>

<line offset="5">What will this come to?</line>
<line>He commands us to provide, and give great gifts,</line>
<line>And all out of an empty coffer;</line>
<line>Nor will he know his purse, or yield me this,</line>
<line>To show him what a beggar his heart is,</line>
<line>Being of no power to make his wishes good.</line>
<line>His promises fly so beyond his state</line>
<line>That what he speaks is all in debt: he owes</line>
<line>For ev&#8217;ry word. He is so kind that he now</line>
<line>Pays interest for&#8217;t; his land&#8217;s put to their books.</line>
<line>Well, would I were gently put out of office</line>
<line>Before I were forc&#8217;d out!</line>
<line>Happier is he that has no friend to feed</line>

<line>Thou art a soldier, therefore seldom rich,</line>

<line>No, I&#8217;ll nothing; for if I should be brib&#8217;d too, there would be none left to rail upon thee, and then thou wouldst sin the faster. Thou giv&#8217;st so long, Timon (I fear me), thou wilt give away thyself in paper shortly. What needs these feasts, pomps, and vainglories?</line>

<speaker>SEN.</speaker>
<line>And late, five thousand; to Varro and to Isidore</line>
<line>He owes nine thousand, besides my former sum,</line>
<line>Which makes it five and twenty. Still in motion</line>
<line>Of raging waste? It cannot hold, it will not.</line>
<line>If I want gold, steal but a beggar&#8217;s dog</line>
<line>And give it Timon, why, the dog coins gold.</line>
<line>If I would sell my horse and buy twenty more</line>
<line>Better than he, why, give my horse to Timon,</line>
<line>Ask nothing, give it him, it foals me straight</line>
<line>And able horses. No porter at his gate,</line>
<line>But rather one that smiles and still invites</line>
<line>All that pass by. It cannot hold, no reason</line>
<line>Can sound his state in safety. Caphis ho!</line>

<line>Get on your cloak and haste you to Lord Timon;</line>

<line>&#8220;Commend me to your master&#8221; and the cap</line>
<line>Plays in the right hand, thus&#8212;but tell him</line>
<line>My uses cry to me; I must serve my turn</line>
<line>Out of mine own. His days and times are past,</line>
<line>And my reliances on his fracted dates</line>
<line>Have smit my credit. I love and honor him,</line>
<line>But must not break my back to heal his finger.</line>
<line>Immediate are my needs, and my relief</line>
<line>Must not be toss&#8217;d and turn&#8217;d to me in words,</line>
<line>But find supply immediate. Get you gone,</line>
<line>Put on a most importunate aspect,</line>
<line>A visage of demand; for I do fear,</line>
<line>When every feather sticks in his own wing,</line>
<line>Lord Timon will be left a naked gull,</line>

<line>Ay, Fool.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>FOOL.</speaker>
<line>I think no usurer but has a fool to his servant; my mistress is one, and I am her fool. When men come to borrow of your masters, they approach sadly, and go away merry; but they enter my master&#8217;s house merrily, and go away sadly. The reason of this?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAR. SERV.</speaker>
<line>I could render one.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>APEM.</speaker>
<line>Do it then, that we may account thee a whoremaster and a knave, which notwithstanding, thou shalt be no less esteem&#8217;d.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAR. SERV.</speaker>
<line>What is a whoremaster, Fool?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FOOL.</speaker>
<line>A fool in good clothes, and something like thee. &#8217;Tis a spirit; sometime&#8217;t appears like a lord, sometime like a lawyer, sometime like a philosopher, with two stones more than &#8217;s artificial one. He is very often like a knight; and, generally, in all shapes that man goes up and down in from fourscore to thirteen, this spirit walks in.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAR. SERV.</speaker>
<line>Thou art not altogether a fool.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FOOL.</speaker>
<line>Nor thou altogether a wise man; as much foolery as I have, so much wit thou lack&#8217;st.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>APEM.</speaker>
<line>That answer might have become Apemantus.</line>
</speech>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FLAV.</speaker>
<line offset="5">O my good lord,</line>
<line>At many times I brought in my accompts,</line>
<line>Laid them before you; you would throw them off,</line>
<line>And say you found them in mine honesty.</line>
<line>When for some trifling present you have bid me</line>
<line>Return so much, I have shook my head, and wept;</line>
<line>Yea, &#8217;gainst th&#8217; authority of manners, pray&#8217;d you</line>
<line>To hold your hand more close. I did endure</line>
<line>Not seldom, nor no slight checks, when I have</line>
<line>Prompted you in the ebb of your estate</line>
<line>And your great flow of debts. My lov&#8217;d lord,</line>
<line>Though you hear now (too late), yet now&#8217;s a time:</line>
<line>The greatest of your having lacks a half</line>
<line>To pay your present debts.</line>

<speaker>FLAV.</speaker>
<line>&#8217;Tis all engag&#8217;d, some forfeited and gone,</line>

<line>How goes our reck&#8217;ning?</line>

<speaker>FLAV.</speaker>
<line>If you suspect my husbandry or falsehood,</line>
<line>Call me before th&#8217; exactest auditors,</line>

<line>When all our offices have been oppress&#8217;d</line>
<line>With riotous feeders, when our vaults have wept</line>
<line>With drunken spilth of wine, when every room</line>
<line>Hath blaz&#8217;d with lights and bray&#8217;d with minstrelsy,</line>
<line>I have retir&#8217;d me to a wasteful cock,</line>

<speech>
<speaker>FLAV.</speaker>
<line>Heavens, have I said, the bounty of this lord!</line>
<line>How many prodigal bits have slaves and peasants</line>
<line>This night englutted! Who is not Timon&#8217;s?</line>
<line>What heart, head, sword, force, means, but is Lord Timon&#8217;s?</line>
<line>Great Timon! Noble, worthy, royal Timon!</line>
<line>Ah, when the means are gone that buy this praise,</line>
<line>The breath is gone whereof this praise is made.</line>
<line>Feast-won, fast-lost; one cloud of winter show&#8217;rs,</line>
<line>These flies are couch&#8217;d.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Come, sermon me no further.</line>
<line>No villainous bounty yet hath pass&#8217;d my heart;</line>
<line>Unwisely, not ignobly, have I given.</line>
<line>Why dost thou weep? Canst thou the conscience lack</line>
<line>To think I shall lack friends? Secure thy heart;</line>
<line>If I would broach the vessels of my love,</line>
<line>And try the argument of hearts, by borrowing,</line>
<line>Men and men&#8217;s fortunes could I frankly use</line>
<line>As I can bid thee speak.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FLAV.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Assurance bless your thoughts!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line>And in some sort these wants of mine are crown&#8217;d,</line>
<line>That I account them blessings; for by these</line>
<line>Shall I try friends. You shall perceive how you</line>
<line>Mistake my fortunes; I am wealthy in my friends.</line>
<line>Within there! Flaminius! Servilius!</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter three servants: Flaminius, Servilius, and Timon&#8217;s First Servant.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>THREE SERVANTS.</speaker>
<line>My lord? My lord?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line>I will dispatch you severally: to Servilius you to Lord Lucius; to Flaminius to Lord Lucullus you&#8212;I hunted with his honor today; to the other you to Sempronius. Commend me to their loves; and I am proud, say, that my occasions have found time to use &#8217;em toward a supply of money. Let the request be fifty talents.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>FLAM.</speaker>
<line>As you have said, my lord.</line>

<line>Lord Lucius and Lucullus? Humh!</line>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line>Go you, sir, to the senators&#8212;</line>
<line>Of whom, even to the state&#8217;s best health, I have</line>
<line>Deserv&#8217;d this hearing&#8212;bid &#8217;em send o&#8217; th&#8217; instant</line>
<line>A thousand talents to me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FLAV.</speaker>
<line offset="5">I have been bold</line>
<line>(For that I knew it the most general way)</line>
<line>To them to use your signet and your name,</line>
<line>But they do shake their heads, and I am here</line>
<line>No richer in return.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Is&#8217;t true? Can &#8217;t be?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FLAV.</speaker>
<line>They answer, in a joint and corporate voice,</line>
<line>That now they are at fall, want treasure, cannot</line>
<line>Do what they would, are sorry; you are honorable,</line>
<line>But yet they could have wish&#8217;d&#8212;they know not&#8212;</line>
<line>Something hath been amiss&#8212;a noble nature</line>
<line>May catch a wrench&#8212;would all were well&#8212;&#8217;tis pity&#8212;</line>
<line>And so, intending other serious matters,</line>
<line>After distasteful looks, and these hard fractions,</line>
<line>With certain half-caps and cold-moving nods,</line>
<line>They froze me into silence.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line offset="5">You gods, reward them!</line>
<line>Prithee, man, look cheerly. These old fellows</line>
<line>Have their ingratitude in them hereditary:</line>
<line>Their blood is cak&#8217;d, &#8217;tis cold, it seldom flows;</line>
<line>&#8217;Tis lack of kindly warmth they are not kind;</line>
<line>And nature, as it grows again toward earth,</line>
<line>Is fashion&#8217;d for the journey, dull and heavy.</line>
<line>Go to Ventidius. (Prithee be not sad,</line>
<line>Thou art true and honest; ingeniously I speak,</line>
<line>No blame belongs to thee.) Ventidius lately</line>
<line>Buried his father, by whose death he&#8217;s stepp&#8217;d</line>
<line>Into a great estate. When he was poor,</line>
<line>Imprison&#8217;d, and in scarcity of friends,</line>
<line>I clear&#8217;d him with five talents. Greet him from me,</line>
<line>Bid him suppose some good necessity</line>
<line>Touches his friend, which craves to be rememb&#8217;red</line>
<line>With those five talents. That had, give&#8217;t these fellows</line>
<line>To whom &#8217;tis instant due. Nev&#8217;r speak or think</line>
<line>That Timon&#8217;s fortunes &#8217;mong his friends can sink.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FLAV.</speaker>
<line>I would I could not think it! That thought is bounty&#8217;s foe;</line>
<line>Being free itself, it thinks all others so.</line>

<scenepersonae>(Flaminius, Lucullus, Lucullus&#8217;s Servant)</scenepersonae>

<stagedir>Flaminius waiting to speak with a lord Lucullus from his master, enters Lucullus&#8217;s Servant to him.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>LUCUL. SERV.</speaker>
<line>I have told my lord of you, he is coming down to you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FLAM.</speaker>
<line>I thank you, sir.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Lucullus.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>LUCUL. SERV.</speaker>
<line>Here&#8217;s my lord.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LUCUL.</speaker>
<stagedir>Aside.</stagedir>
<line>One of Lord Timon&#8217;s men? A gift, I warrant. Why, this hits right; I dreamt of a silver basin and ew&#8217;r tonight.&#8212;Flaminius, honest Flaminius, you are very respectively welcome, sir. Fill me some wine.</line>
<stagedir>Exit Lucullus&#8217;s Servant.</stagedir>
<line>And how does that honorable, complete, free-hearted gentleman of Athens, thy very bountiful good lord and master?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FLAM.</speaker>
<line>His health is well, sir.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LUCUL.</speaker>
<line>I am right glad that his health is well, sir; and what hast thou there under thy cloak, pretty Flaminius?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FLAM.</speaker>
<line>Faith, nothing but an empty box, sir, which, in my lord&#8217;s behalf, I come to entreat your honor to supply; who, having great and instant occasion to use fifty talents, hath sent to your lordship to furnish him, nothing doubting your present assistance therein.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LUCUL.</speaker>
<line>La, la, la, la! &#8220;nothing doubting,&#8221; says he? Alas, good lord! A noble gentleman &#8217;tis, if he would not keep so good a house. Many a time and often I ha&#8217; din&#8217;d with him, and told him on&#8217;t, and come again to supper to him of purpose to have him spend less, and yet he would embrace no counsel, take no warning by my coming. Every man has his fault, and honesty is his. I ha&#8217; told him on&#8217;t, but I could ne&#8217;er get him from&#8217;t.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Lucullus&#8217;s Servant with wine.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>LUCUL. SERV.</speaker>
<line>Please your lordship, here is the wine.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LUCUL.</speaker>
<line>Flaminius, I have noted thee always wise. Here&#8217;s to thee.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FLAM.</speaker>
<line>Your lordship speaks your pleasure.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LUCUL.</speaker>
<line>I have observ&#8217;d thee always for a towardly prompt spirit&#8212;give thee thy due&#8212;and one that knows what belongs to reason; and canst use the time well, if the time use thee well. Good parts in thee!</line>
<stagedir>To Servant.</stagedir>
<line>Get you gone, sirrah.</line>
<stagedir>Exit Lucullus&#8217;s Servant.</stagedir>
<line>Draw nearer, honest Flaminius. Thy lord&#8217;s a bountiful gentleman, but thou art wise, and thou know&#8217;st well enough (although thou com&#8217;st to me) that this is no time to lend money, especially upon bare friendship without security. Here&#8217;s three solidares for thee; good boy, wink at me, and say thou saw&#8217;st me not. Fare thee well.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FLAM.</speaker>
<line>Is&#8217;t possible the world should so much differ,</line>
<line>And we alive that lived? Fly, damned baseness,</line>
<line>To him that worships thee!</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Throwing the money back.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>LUCUL.</speaker>
<line>Ha? Now I see thou art a fool, and fit for thy master.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit Lucullus.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>FLAM.</speaker>
<line>May these add to the number that may scald thee!</line>
<line>Let molten coin be thy damnation,</line>
<line>Thou disease of a friend, and not himself!</line>
<line>Has friendship such a faint and milky heart,</line>
<line>It turns in less than two nights? O you gods!</line>
<line>I feel my master&#8217;s passion. This slave</line>
<line>Unto his honor has my lord&#8217;s meat in him;</line>
<line>Why should it thrive and turn to nutriment</line>
<line>When he is turn&#8217;d to poison?</line>
<line>O, may diseases only work upon&#8217;t!</line>
<line>And when he&#8217;s sick to death, let not that part of nature</line>
<line>Which my lord paid for, be of any power</line>
<line>To expel sickness, but prolong his hour!</line>

<scenepersonae>(Lucius, Three Strangers, Servilius)</scenepersonae>

<stagedir>Enter Lucius with three Strangers.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>LUC.</speaker>
<line>Who, the Lord Timon? He is my very good friend, and an honorable gentleman.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. STRAN.</speaker>
<line>We know him for no less, though we are but strangers to him. But I can tell you one thing, my lord, and which I hear from common rumors, now Lord Timon&#8217;s happy hours are done and past, and his estate shrinks from him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LUC.</speaker>
<line>Fie, no, do not believe it; he cannot want for money.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. STRAN.</speaker>
<line>But believe you this, my lord, that not long ago one of his men was with the Lord Lucullus to borrow so many talents, nay, urg&#8217;d extremely for&#8217;t, and show&#8217;d what necessity belong&#8217;d to&#8217;t, and yet was denied.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LUC.</speaker>
<line>How?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. STRAN.</speaker>
<line>I tell you, denied, my lord.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LUC.</speaker>
<line>What a strange case was that! Now before the gods, I am asham&#8217;d on&#8217;t. Denied that honorable man? There was very little honor show&#8217;d in&#8217;t. For my own part, I must needs confess, I have receiv&#8217;d some small kindnesses from him, as money, plate, jewels, and such like trifles&#8212;nothing comparing to his&#8212;yet had he mistook him and sent to me, I should ne&#8217;er have denied his occasion so many talents.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Servilius.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>SER.</speaker>
<line>See, by good hap, yonder&#8217;s my lord; I have sweat to see his honor. My honor&#8217;d lord&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LUC.</speaker>
<line>Servilius? You are kindly met, sir. Fare thee well, commend me to thy honorable virtuous lord, my very exquisite friend.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SER.</speaker>
<line>May it please your honor, my lord hath sent&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LUC.</speaker>
<line>Ha? What has he sent? I am so much endear&#8217;d to that lord: he&#8217;s ever sending. How shall I thank him, think&#8217;st thou? And what has he sent now?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SER.</speaker>
<line>H&#8217;as only sent his present occasion now, my lord; requesting your lordship to supply his instant use with so many talents.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LUC.</speaker>
<line>I know his lordship is but merry with me;</line>
<line>He cannot want fifty&#8212;five hundred talents.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SER.</speaker>
<line>But in the mean time he wants less, my lord.</line>
<line>If his occasion were not virtuous,</line>
<line>I should not urge it half so faithfully.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LUC.</speaker>
<line>Dost thou speak seriously, Servilius?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SER.</speaker>
<line>Upon my soul, &#8217;tis true, sir.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LUC.</speaker>
<line>What a wicked beast was I to disfurnish myself against such a good time, when I might ha&#8217; shown myself honorable! How unluckily it happ&#8217;ned that I should purchase the day before for a little part, and undo a great deal of honor! Servilius, now before the gods, I am not able to do (the more beast, I say!)&#8212;I was sending to use Lord Timon myself, these gentlemen can witness; but I would not, for the wealth of Athens, I had done&#8217;t now. Commend me bountifully to his good lordship, and I hope his honor will conceive the fairest of me, because I have no power to be kind. And tell him this from me, I count it one of my greatest afflictions, say, that I cannot pleasure such an honorable gentleman. Good Servilius, will you befriend me so far as to use mine own words to him?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SER.</speaker>
<line>Yes, sir, I shall.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit Servilius.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>LUC.</speaker>
<stagedir>Calling after him.</stagedir>
<line>I&#8217;ll look you out a good turn, Servilius.&#8212;</line>
<line>True, as you said, Timon is shrunk indeed,</line>
<line>And he that&#8217;s once denied will hardly speed.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>1. STRAN.</speaker>
<line>Do you observe this, Hostilius?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. STRAN.</speaker>
<line offset="7">Ay, too well.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. STRAN.</speaker>
<line>Why, this is the world&#8217;s soul, and just of the same piece</line>
<line>Is every flatterer&#8217;s sport. Who can call him</line>
<line>His friend that dips in the same dish? For, in</line>
<line>My knowing, Timon has been this lord&#8217;s father,</line>
<line>And kept his credit with his purse;</line>
<line>Supported his estate, nay, Timon&#8217;s money</line>
<line>Has paid his men their wages. He ne&#8217;er drinks</line>
<line>But Timon&#8217;s silver treads upon his lip,</line>
<line>And yet&#8212;O, see the monstrousness of man</line>
<line>When he looks out in an ungrateful shape!&#8212;</line>
<line>He does deny him (in respect of his)</line>
<line>What charitable men afford to beggars.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>3. STRAN.</speaker>
<line>Religion groans at it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. STRAN.</speaker>
<line offset="4">For mine own part,</line>
<line>I never tasted Timon in my life,</line>
<line>Nor came any of his bounties over me</line>
<line>To mark me for his friend; yet, I protest,</line>
<line>For his right noble mind, illustrious virtue,</line>
<line>And honorable carriage,</line>
<line>Had his necessity made use of me,</line>
<line>I would have put my wealth into donation,</line>
<line>And the best half should have return&#8217;d to him,</line>
<line>So much I love his heart. But I perceive</line>
<line>Men must learn now with pity to dispense,</line>
<line>For policy sits above conscience.</line>

<stagedir>Enter Timon&#8217;s First Servant with Sempronius, another of Timon&#8217;s friends.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>SEM.</speaker>
<line>Must he needs trouble me in&#8217;t&#8212;hum!&#8212;&#8217;bove all others?</line>
<line>He might have tried Lord Lucius or Lucullus;</line>
<line>And now Ventidius is wealthy too,</line>
<line>Whom he redeem&#8217;d from prison. All these</line>
<line>Owes their estates unto him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. TIM. SERV.</speaker>
<line offset="6">My lord,</line>
<line>They have all been touch&#8217;d and found base metal,</line>
<line>For they have all denied him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SEM.</speaker>
<line offset="6">How? Have they denied him?</line>
<line>Has Ventidius and Lucullus denied him,</line>
<line>And does he send to me? Three? Humh!</line>
<line>It shows but little love or judgment in him.</line>
<line>Must I be his last refuge? His friends, like physicians,</line>
<line>Thrive, give him over; must I take th&#8217; cure upon me?</line>
<line>H&#8217;as much disgrac&#8217;d me in&#8217;t, I&#8217;m angry at him,</line>
<line>That might have known my place. I see no sense for&#8217;t,</line>
<line>But his occasions might have wooed me first;</line>
<line>For, in my conscience, I was the first man</line>
<line>That e&#8217;er received gift from him;</line>
<line>And does he think so backwardly of me now,</line>
<line>That I&#8217;ll requite it last? No!</line>
<line>So it may prove an argument of laughter</line>
<line>To th&#8217; rest, and &#8217;mongst lords I be thought a fool.</line>
<line>I&#8217;d rather than the worth of thrice the sum</line>
<line>H&#8217;ad sent to me first, but for my mind&#8217;s sake;</line>
<line>I&#8217;d such a courage to do him good. But now return,</line>
<line>And with their faint reply this answer join:</line>
<line>Who bates mine honor shall not know my coin.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>1. TIM. SERV.</speaker>
<line>Excellent! Your lordship&#8217;s a goodly villain. The devil knew not what he did when he made man politic; he cross&#8217;d himself by&#8217;t; and I cannot think but, in the end, the villainies of man will set him clear. How fairly this lord strives to appear foul! Takes virtuous copies to be wicked; like those that under hot ardent zeal would set whole realms on fire; of such a nature is his politic love.</line>
<line>This was my lord&#8217;s best hope, now all are fled,</line>
<line>Save only the gods. Now his friends are dead,</line>
<line>Doors, that were ne&#8217;er acquainted with their wards</line>
<line>Many a bounteous year, must be employ&#8217;d</line>
<line>Now to guard sure their master.</line>

<line>Ay, but the days are wax&#8217;d shorter with him.</line>
<line>You must consider that a prodigal course</line>

<speaker>1. SEN.</speaker>
<line>Now, captain?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ALCIB.</speaker>
<line>I am an humble suitor to your virtues;</line>
<line>For pity is the virtue of the law,</line>
<line>And none but tyrants use it cruelly.</line>
<line>It pleases time and fortune to lie heavy</line>
<line>Upon a friend of mine, who in hot blood</line>
<line>Hath stepp&#8217;d into the law, which is past depth</line>
<line>To those that (without heed) do plunge into&#8217;t.</line>
<line>He is a man (setting his fate aside)</line>
<line>Of comely virtues;</line>
<line>Nor did he soil the fact with cowardice</line>
<line>(An honor in him which buys out his fault),</line>
<line>But with a noble fury and fair spirit,</line>
<line>Seeing his reputation touch&#8217;d to death,</line>
<line>He did oppose his foe;</line>
<line>And with such sober and unnoted passion</line>
<line>He did behoove his anger, ere &#8217;twas spent,</line>
<line>As if he had but prov&#8217;d an argument.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. SEN.</speaker>
<line>You undergo too strict a paradox,</line>
<line>Striving to make an ugly deed look fair.</line>
<line>Your words have took such pains as if they labor&#8217;d</line>
<line>To bring manslaughter into form, and set quarrelling</line>
<line>Upon the head of valor; which indeed</line>
<line>Is valor misbegot, and came into the world</line>
<line>When sects and factions were newly born.</line>
<line>He&#8217;s truly valiant that can wisely suffer</line>
<line>The worst that man can breathe, and make his wrongs</line>
<line>His outsides, to wear them like his raiment, carelessly,</line>
<line>And ne&#8217;er prefer his injuries to his heart,</line>
<line>To bring it into danger.</line>
<line>If wrongs be evils and enforce us kill,</line>

<speech>
<speaker>ALCIB.</speaker>
<line>My lords, then, under favor, pardon me</line>
<line>If I speak like a captain.</line>
<line>Why do fond men expose themselves to battle,</line>
<line>And not endure all threats? Sleep upon&#8217;t,</line>
<line>And let the foes quietly cut their throats</line>
<line>Without repugnancy? If there be</line>
<line>Such valor in the bearing, what make we</line>
<line>Abroad? Why then, women are more valiant</line>
<line>That stay at home, if bearing carry it;</line>
<line>And the ass more captain than the lion, the fellow</line>
<line>Loaden with irons wiser than the judge,</line>
<line>If wisdom be in suffering. O my lords,</line>
<line>As you are great, be pitifully good.</line>
<line>Who cannot condemn rashness in cold blood?</line>
<line>To kill, I grant, is sin&#8217;s extremest gust,</line>
<line>But in defense, by mercy, &#8217;tis most just.</line>
<line>To be in anger is impiety;</line>
<line>But who is man that is not angry?</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. SEN.</speaker>
<line>He has made too much plenty with &#8217;em.</line>

<line>Drowns him and takes his valor prisoner.</line>
<line>If there were no foes, that were enough</line>
<line>To overcome him. In that beastly fury</line>
<line>He has been known to commit outrages</line>
<line>And cherish factions. &#8217;Tis inferr&#8217;d to us,</line>
<line>His days are foul and his drink dangerous.</line>

<line>And for I know your reverend ages love</line>
<line>Security, I&#8217;ll pawn my victories, all</line>
<line>My honor to you, upon his good returns.</line>
<line>If by this crime he owes the law his life,</line>
<line>Why, let the war receive&#8217;t in valiant gore,</line>
<line>For law is strict, and war is nothing more.</line>

<line>I also wish it to you. I think this honorable lord did but try us this other day.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. LORD.</speaker>
<line>Upon that were my thoughts tiring when we encount&#8217;red. I hope it is not so low with him as he made it seem in the trial of his several friends.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. LORD.</speaker>
<line>It should not be, by the persuasion of his new feasting.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>1. LORD.</speaker>
<line>I should think so. He hath sent me an earnest inviting, which many my near occasions did urge me to put off; but he hath conjur&#8217;d me beyond them, and I must needs appear.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. LORD.</speaker>
<line>In like manner was I in debt to my importunate business, but he would not hear my excuse. I am sorry, when he sent to borrow of me, that my provision was out.</line>

<line>I do conceive.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line>Each man to his stool, with that spur as he would to the lip of his mistress; your diet shall be in all places alike. Make not a city feast of it, to let the meat cool ere we can agree upon the first place; sit, sit. The gods require our thanks.</line>
<line>You great benefactors, sprinkle our society with thankfulness. For your own gifts, make yourselves prais&#8217;d; but reserve still to give, lest your deities be despis&#8217;d. Lend to each man enough, that one need not lend to another; for were your godheads to borrow of men, men would forsake the gods. Make the meat be belov&#8217;d more than the man that gives it. Let no assembly of twenty be without a score of villains. If there sit twelve women at the table, let a dozen of them be&#8212;as they are. The rest of your fees, O gods&#8212;the senators of Athens, together with the common lag of people&#8212;what is amiss in them, you gods, make suitable for destruction. For these my present friends, as they are to me nothing, so in nothing bless them, and to nothing are they welcome.</line>

<line>So noble a master fall&#8217;n, all gone, and not</line>
<line>One friend to take his fortune by the arm,</line>

<speaker>2. TIM. SERV.</speaker>
<line offset="5">As we do turn our backs</line>
<line>From our companion thrown into his grave,</line>
<line>So his familiars to his buried fortunes</line>
<line>Slink all away, leave their false vows with him,</line>
<line>Like empty purses pick&#8217;d; and his poor self,</line>
<line>A dedicated beggar to the air,</line>

<line>Yet do our hearts wear Timon&#8217;s livery,</line>
<line>That see I by our faces; we are fellows still,</line>
<line>Serving alike in sorrow. Leak&#8217;d is our bark,</line>
<line>And we, poor mates, stand on the dying deck,</line>
<line>Hearing the surges threat; we must all part</line>

<line offset="4">Good fellows all,</line>
<line>The latest of my wealth I&#8217;ll share amongst you.</line>
<line>Where ever we shall meet, for Timon&#8217;s sake</line>
<line>Let&#8217;s yet be fellows. Let&#8217;s shake our heads, and say,</line>
<line>As &#8217;twere a knell unto our master&#8217;s fortunes,</line>
<line>&#8220;We have seen better days.&#8221; Let each take some;</line>

<stagedir>Giving them money.</stagedir>
<line>Nay, put out all your hands. Not one word more:</line>
<line>Thus part we rich in sorrow, parting poor.</line>

<stagedir>Embrace, and part several ways.</stagedir>
<line>O, the fierce wretchedness that glory brings us!</line>
<line>Who would not wish to be from wealth exempt,</line>
<line>Since riches point to misery and contempt?</line>
<line>Who would be so mock&#8217;d with glory, or to live</line>
<line>But in a dream of friendship,</line>
<line>To have his pomp, and all what state compounds,</line>
<line>But only painted, like his varnish&#8217;d friends?</line>
<line>Poor honest lord, brought low by his own heart,</line>
<line>Undone by goodness! Strange, unusual blood,</line>
<line>When man&#8217;s worst sin is, he does too much good!</line>
<line>Who then dares to be half so kind again?</line>
<line>For bounty, that makes gods, do still mar men.</line>
<line>My dearest lord, blest to be most accurs&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Rich only to be wretched, thy great fortunes</line>
<line>Are made thy chief afflictions. Alas, kind lord,</line>
<line>He&#8217;s flung in rage from this ingrateful seat</line>
<line>Of monstrous friends; nor has he with him to</line>
<line>Supply his life, or that which can command it.</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll follow and inquire him out.</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll ever serve his mind with my best will;</line>
<line>Whilst I have gold, I&#8217;ll be his steward still.</line>

<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line>O blessed breeding sun, draw from the earth</line>
<line>Rotten humidity; below thy sister&#8217;s orb</line>
<line>Infect the air! Twinn&#8217;d brothers of one womb,</line>
<line>Whose procreation, residence, and birth</line>
<line>Scarce is dividant, touch them with several fortunes,</line>
<line>The greater scorns the lesser. Not nature</line>
<line>(To whom all sores lay siege) can bear great fortune</line>
<line>But by contempt of nature.</line>
<line>Raise me this beggar, and deny&#8217;t that lord,</line>
<line>The senator shall bear contempt hereditary,</line>
<line>The beggar native honor.</line>
<line>It is the paster lards the brother&#8217;s sides,</line>
<line>The want that makes him lean. Who dares? Who dares</line>
<line>In purity of manhood stand upright</line>
<line>And say, &#8220;This man&#8217;s a flatterer&#8221;? If one be,</line>
<line>So are they all; for every grize of fortune</line>
<line>Is smooth&#8217;d by that below. The learned pate</line>
<line>Ducks to the golden fool. All&#8217;s obliquy;</line>
<line>There&#8217;s nothing level in our cursed natures</line>

<line>All feasts, societies, and throngs of men!</line>

<line>Destruction fang mankind! Earth, yield me roots!</line>

<stagedir>Digging.</stagedir>
<line>Who seeks for better of thee, sauce his palate</line>
<line>With thy most operant poison! What is here?</line>
<line>Gold? Yellow, glittering, precious gold?</line>
<line>No, gods, I am no idle votarist;</line>
<line>Roots, you clear heavens! Thus much of this will make</line>
<line>Black white, foul fair, wrong right,</line>

<line>Ha, you gods! Why this? What this, you gods? Why, this</line>
<line>Will lug your priests and servants from your sides,</line>
<line>Pluck stout men&#8217;s pillows from below their heads.</line>
<line>This yellow slave</line>

<line>A beast, as thou art. The canker gnaw thy heart,</line>
<line>For showing me again the eyes of man!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ALCIB.</speaker>
<line>What is thy name? Is man so hateful to thee,</line>
<line>That art thyself a man?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line>I am Misanthropos, and hate mankind.</line>
<line>For thy part, I do wish thou wert a dog,</line>
<line>That I might love thee something.</line>

<line offset="7">I know thee well;</line>

<line>I know thee too, and more than that I know thee</line>
<line>I not desire to know. Follow thy drum,</line>
<line>With man&#8217;s blood paint the ground, gules, gules,</line>
<line>Religious canons, civil laws are cruel;</line>
<line>Then what should war be? This fell whore of thine</line>

<speaker>ALCIB.</speaker>
<line offset="4">What is it, Timon?</line>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line>Promise me friendship, but perform none. If thou wilt not promise, the gods plague thee, for thou art a man! If thou dost perform, confound thee, for thou art a man!</line>

<speaker>ALCIB.</speaker>

<line>Yes.</line>

<line>Be a whore still. They love thee not that use thee;</line>

<line>Make use of thy salt hours, season the slaves</line>

<line>Pardon him, sweet Timandra, for his wits</line>
<line>Are drown&#8217;d and lost in his calamities.</line>
<line>I have but little gold of late, brave Timon,</line>
<line>The want whereof doth daily make revolt</line>
<line>In my penurious band. I have heard, and griev&#8217;d,</line>
<line>How cursed Athens, mindless of thy worth,</line>
<line>Forgetting thy great deeds when neighbor states,</line>
<line>But for thy sword and fortune, trod upon them&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line>I prithee beat thy drum and get thee gone.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ALCIB.</speaker>
<line>I am thy friend, and pity thee, dear Timon.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line>How dost thou pity him whom thou dost trouble?</line>
<line>I had rather be alone.</line>

<line offset="4">Why, fare thee well;</line>
<line>Here is some gold for thee.</line>

<line offset="5">Ay, Timon, and have cause.</line>

<line>Why me, Timon?</line>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line offset="4">That by killing of villains</line>
<line>Thou wast born to conquer my country.</line>

<line>Be as a planetary plague when Jove</line>

<line>In the sick air. Let not thy sword skip one.</line>
<line>Pity not honor&#8217;d age for his white beard,</line>
<line>He is an usurer. Strike me the counterfeit matron,</line>
<line>It is her habit only that is honest,</line>
<line>Herself&#8217;s a bawd. Let not the virgin&#8217;s cheek</line>
<line>Make soft thy trenchant sword; for those milk paps,</line>
<line>That through the window-bars bore at men&#8217;s eyes,</line>
<line>Are not within the leaf of pity writ,</line>
<line>But set them down horrible traitors. Spare not the babe,</line>
<line>Whose dimpled smiles from fools exhaust their mercy;</line>
<line>Think it a bastard, whom the oracle</line>
<line>Hath doubtfully pronounc&#8217;d the throat shall cut,</line>
<line>And mince it sans remorse. Swear against objects,</line>
<line>Put armor on thine ears and on thine eyes,</line>
<line>Whose proof nor yells of mothers, maids, nor babes,</line>
<line>Nor sight of priests in holy vestments bleeding,</line>
<line>Shall pierce a jot. There&#8217;s gold to pay thy soldiers,</line>
<line>Make large confusion; and thy fury spent,</line>
<line>Confounded be thyself! Speak not, be gone.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ALCIB.</speaker>
<line>Hast thou gold yet? I&#8217;ll take the gold thou givest me,</line>
<line>Not all thy counsel.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>BOTH PHRY. AND TIMAN.</speaker>
<line>Give us some gold, good Timon; hast thou more?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line>Enough to make a whore forswear her trade,</line>
<line>And to make whores, a bawd. Hold up, you sluts,</line>
<line>Your aprons mountant. You are not oathable,</line>
<line>Although I know You&#8217;ll swear, terribly swear</line>
<line>Into strong shudders and to heavenly agues</line>
<line>Th&#8217; immortal gods that hear you. Spare your oaths;</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll trust to your conditions, be whores still.</line>
<line>And he whose pious breath seeks to convert you,</line>
<line>Be strong in whore, allure him, burn him up,</line>
<line>Let your close fire predominate his smoke,</line>
<line>And be no turncoats; yet may your pains six months</line>
<line>Be quite contrary. And thatch your poor thin roofs</line>
<line>With burdens of the dead&#8212;some that were hang&#8217;d,</line>
<line>No matter; wear them, betray with them. Whore still,</line>
<line>Paint till a horse may mire upon your face:</line>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line>Consumptions sow</line>
<line>In hollow bones of man, strike their sharp shins,</line>
<line>And mar men&#8217;s spurring. Crack the lawyer&#8217;s voice,</line>
<line>That he may never more false title plead,</line>
<line>Nor sound his quillets shrilly; hoar the flamen,</line>
<line>That scolds against the quality of flesh</line>
<line>And not believes himself. Down with the nose,</line>
<line>Down with it flat; take the bridge quite away</line>
<line>Of him that, his particular to foresee,</line>
<line>Smells from the general weal. Make curl&#8217;d-pate ruffians bald,</line>
<line>And let the unscarr&#8217;d braggarts of the war</line>
<line>Derive some pain from you. Plague all,</line>
<line>That your activity may defeat and quell</line>
<line>The source of all erection. There&#8217;s more gold.</line>
<line>Do you damn others, and let this damn you,</line>
<line>And ditches grave you all!</line>

<speech>
<speaker>BOTH PHRY. AND TIMAN.</speaker>
<line>More counsel with more money, bounteous Timon.</line>

<line>Thy flatterers yet wear silk, drink wine, lie soft,</line>
<line>Hug their diseas&#8217;d perfumes, and have forgot</line>
<line>That ever Timon was. Shame not these woods</line>
<line>By putting on the cunning of a carper.</line>
<line>Be thou a flatterer now, and seek to thrive</line>
<line>By that which has undone thee; hinge thy knee,</line>
<line>And let his very breath whom thou&#8217;lt observe</line>
<line>Blow off thy cap; praise his most vicious strain,</line>
<line>And call it excellent. Thou wast told thus;</line>
<line>Thou gav&#8217;st thine ears (like tapsters that bade welcome)</line>
<line>To knaves and all approachers. &#8217;Tis most just</line>

<line>Will put thy shirt on warm? Will these moist trees,</line>
<line>That have outliv&#8217;d the eagle, page thy heels</line>
<line>And skip when thou point&#8217;st out? Will the cold brook,</line>
<line>Candied with ice, caudle thy morning taste</line>
<line>To cure thy o&#8217;ernight&#8217;s surfeit? Call the creatures</line>
<line>Whose naked natures live in all the spite</line>
<line>Of wreakful heaven, whose bare unhoused trunks,</line>

<line>The icy precepts of respect, but followed</line>
<line>The sug&#8217;red game before thee. But myself,</line>
<line>Who had the world as my confectionary,</line>
<line>The mouths, the tongues, the eyes, and hearts of men</line>
<line>At duty, more than I could frame employment;</line>
<line>That numberless upon me stuck as leaves</line>
<line>Do on the oak, have with one winter&#8217;s brush</line>
<line>Fell from their boughs, and left me open, bare,</line>
<line>For every storm that blows&#8212;I to bear this,</line>
<line>That never knew but better, is some burden:</line>
<line>Thy nature did commence in sufferance, time</line>
<line>Hath made thee hard in&#8217;t. Why shouldst thou hate men?</line>
<line>They never flatter&#8217;d thee. What hast thou given?</line>
<line>If thou wilt curse, thy father (that poor rag)</line>
<line>Must be thy subject, who in spite put stuff</line>
<line>To some she-beggar and compounded thee</line>
<line>Poor rogue hereditary. Hence, be gone!</line>
<line>If thou hadst not been born the worst of men,</line>

What beast couldst thou be, that were not subject to a beast? And what a beast art thou already, that seest not thy loss in transformation!</line>

<speech>
<speaker>1. BAN.</speaker>
<line>Where should he have this gold? It is some poor fragment, some slender ort of his remainder. The mere want of gold, and the falling-from of his friends, drove him into this melancholy.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. BAN.</speaker>
<line>It is nois&#8217;d he hath a mass of treasure.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>3. BAN.</speaker>
<line>Let us make the assay upon him. If he care not for&#8217;t, he will supply us easily; if he covetously reserve it, how shall &#8217;s get it?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. BAN.</speaker>
<line>True; for he bears it not about him, &#8217;tis hid.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line>Your greatest want is, you want much of meat.</line>
<line>Why should you want? Behold, the earth hath roots;</line>
<line>Within this mile break forth a hundred springs;</line>
<line>The oaks bear mast, the briers scarlet heps;</line>
<line>The bounteous huswife Nature on each bush</line>

<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line>Nor on the beasts themselves, the birds and fishes;</line>
<line>You must eat men. Yet thanks I must you con</line>
<line>That you are thieves profess&#8217;d, that you work not</line>
<line>In holier shapes; for there is boundless theft</line>
<line>In limited professions. Rascal thieves,</line>
<line>Here&#8217;s gold. Go, suck the subtle blood o&#8217; th&#8217; grape,</line>
<line>Till the high fever seethe your blood to froth,</line>
<line>And so scape hanging. Trust not the physician,</line>
<line>His antidotes are poison, and he slays</line>
<line>More than you rob. Take wealth and lives together,</line>
<line>Do, villains, do, since you protest to do&#8217;t.</line>
<line>Like workmen, I&#8217;ll example you with thievery:</line>
<line>The sun&#8217;s a thief, and with his great attraction</line>
<line>Robs the vast sea; the moon&#8217;s an arrant thief,</line>
<line>And her pale fire she snatches from the sun;</line>
<line>The sea&#8217;s a thief, whose liquid surge resolves</line>
<line>The moon into salt tears; the earth&#8217;s a thief,</line>
<line>That feeds and breeds by a composture stol&#8217;n</line>
<line>From gen&#8217;ral excrement; each thing&#8217;s a thief.</line>
<line>The laws, your curb and whip, in their rough power</line>
<line>Has uncheck&#8217;d theft. Love not yourselves, away,</line>
<line>Rob one another. There&#8217;s more gold. Cut throats,</line>
<line>All that you meet are thieves. To Athens go,</line>
<line>Break open shops; nothing can you steal</line>
<line>But thieves do lose it. Steal less for this I give you,</line>
<line>And gold confound you howsoe&#8217;er! Amen.</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. BAN.</speaker>
<line>&#8217;Tis in the malice of mankind that he thus advises us, not to have us thrive in our mystery.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. BAN.</speaker>
<line>I&#8217;ll believe him as an enemy, and give over my trade.</line>

<line>How rarely does it meet with this time&#8217;s guise,</line>
<line>When man was wish&#8217;d to love his enemies!</line>
<line>Grant I may ever love, and rather woo</line>
<line>Those that would mischief me than those that do!</line>
<line>H&#8217;as caught me in his eye, I will present</line>
<line>My honest grief unto him; and as my lord,</line>
<line>Still serve him with my life. My dearest master!</line>

<speech>
<speaker>FLAV.</speaker>
<line>An honest poor servant of yours.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line>Then I know thee not.</line>
<line>I never had honest man about me, I; all</line>
<line>I kept were knaves, to serve in meat to villains.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FLAV.</speaker>
<line>The gods are witness,</line>
<line>Nev&#8217;r did poor steward wear a truer grief</line>
<line>For his undone lord than mine eyes for you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line>What, dost thou weep? Come nearer. Then I love thee,</line>
<line>Because thou art a woman, and disclaim&#8217;st</line>
<line>Flinty mankind, whose eyes do never give</line>
<line>But thorough lust and laughter. Pity&#8217;s sleeping:</line>
<line>Strange times, that weep with laughing, not with weeping!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FLAV.</speaker>
<line>I beg of you to know me, good my lord,</line>
<line>T&#8217; accept my grief, and whilst this poor wealth lasts</line>
<line>To entertain me as your steward still.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line>Had I a steward</line>
<line>So true, so just, and now so comfortable?</line>
<line>It almost turns my dangerous nature wild.</line>
<line>Let me behold thy face. Surely, this man</line>
<line>Was born of woman.</line>
<line>Forgive my general and exceptless rashness,</line>
<line>You perpetual-sober gods! I do proclaim</line>
<line>One honest man&#8212;mistake me not, but one;</line>
<line>No more, I pray&#8212;and he&#8217;s a steward.</line>
<line>How fain would I have hated all mankind,</line>
<line>And thou redeem&#8217;st thyself. But all, save thee,</line>
<line>I fell with curses.</line>
<line>Methinks thou art more honest now than wise;</line>
<line>For, by oppressing and betraying me,</line>
<line>Thou mightst have sooner got another service;</line>
<line>For many so arrive at second masters,</line>
<line>Upon their first lord&#8217;s neck. But tell me true</line>
<line>(For I must ever doubt, though ne&#8217;er so sure),</line>
<line>Is not thy kindness subtle, covetous,</line>
<line>If not a usuring kindness, and, as rich men deal gifts,</line>
<line>Expecting in return twenty for one?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FLAV.</speaker>
<line>No, my most worthy master, in whose breast</line>
<line>Doubt and suspect, alas, are plac&#8217;d too late;</line>
<line>You should have fear&#8217;d false times when you did feast:</line>
<line>Suspect still comes where an estate is least.</line>
<line>That which I show, heaven knows, is merely love,</line>
<line>Duty, and zeal to your unmatched mind,</line>
<line>Care of your food and living; and believe it,</line>
<line>My most honor&#8217;d lord,</line>
<line>For any benefit that points to me,</line>
<line>Either in hope or present, I&#8217;d exchange</line>
<line>For this one wish, that you had power and wealth</line>
<line>To requite me by making rich yourself.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line>Look thee, &#8217;tis so. Thou singly honest man,</line>
<line>Here, take; the gods out of my misery</line>
<line>Has sent thee treasure. Go, live rich and happy,</line>
<line>But thus condition&#8217;d: thou shalt build from men;</line>
<line>Hate all, curse all, show charity to none,</line>
<line>But let the famish&#8217;d flesh slide from the bone</line>
<line>Ere thou relieve the beggar. Give to dogs</line>
<line>What thou deniest to men. Let prisons swallow &#8217;em,</line>
<line>Debts wither &#8217;em to nothing; be men like blasted woods,</line>
<line>And may diseases lick up their false bloods!</line>
<line>And so farewell and thrive.</line>

<line offset="5">O, let me stay,</line>

<line offset="3">Certain. Alcibiades reports it;</line>

<line>Distress of his; it will show honestly in us,</line>

<line offset="5">Good as the best.</line>
<line>Promising is the very air o&#8217; th&#8217; time;</line>

<line>Performance is ever the duller for his act,</line>
<line>And but in the plainer and simpler kind of people</line>
<line>The deed of saying is quite out of use.</line>
<line>To promise is most courtly and fashionable;</line>
<line>Performance is a kind of will or testament</line>

<speaker>POET.</speaker>
<line offset="4">I am thinking</line>
<line>What I shall say I have provided for him.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>PAIN.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Our late noble master!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line>Have I once liv&#8217;d to see two honest men?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POET.</speaker>
<line>Sir,</line>
<line>Having often of your open bounty tasted,</line>
<line>Hearing you were retir&#8217;d, your friends fall&#8217;n off,</line>
<line>Whose thankless natures (O abhorred spirits!)</line>
<line>Not all the whips of heaven are large enough&#8212;</line>
<line>What, to you,</line>
<line>Whose star-like nobleness gave life and influence</line>
<line>To their whole being! I am rapt and cannot cover</line>
<line>The monstrous bulk of this ingratitude</line>
<line>With any size of words.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line>Let it go naked, men may see&#8217;t the better.</line>
<line>You that are honest, by being what you are</line>
<line>Make them best seen and known.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAIN.</speaker>
<line offset="7">He and myself</line>
<line>Have travail&#8217;d in the great show&#8217;r of your gifts,</line>
<line>And sweetly felt it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Ay, you are honest men.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAIN.</speaker>
<line>We are hither come to offer you our service.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line>Most honest men! Why, how shall I requite you?</line>
<line>Can you eat roots and drink cold water? No?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BOTH.</speaker>
<line>What we can do, we&#8217;ll do, to do you service.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line>Y&#8217; are honest men; y&#8217; have heard that I have gold,</line>
<line>I am sure you have. Speak truth, y&#8217; are honest men.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAIN.</speaker>
<line>So it is said, my noble lord, but therefore</line>
<line>Came not my friend nor I.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line>Good honest men! Thou draw&#8217;st a counterfeit</line>
<line>Best in all Athens; th&#8217; art indeed the best,</line>
<line>Thou counterfeit&#8217;st most lively.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAIN.</speaker>
<line offset="7">So, so, my lord.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line>E&#8217;en so, sir, as I say.&#8212;And, for thy fiction,</line>
<line>Why, thy verse swells with stuff so fine and smooth</line>
<line>That thou art even natural in thine art.</line>
<line>But for all this, my honest-natur&#8217;d friends,</line>
<line>I must needs say you have a little fault;</line>
<line>Marry, &#8217;tis not monstrous in you, neither wish I</line>
<line>You take much pains to mend.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BOTH.</speaker>
<line offset="6">Beseech your honor</line>
<line>To make it known to us.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line offset="5">You&#8217;ll take it ill.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BOTH.</speaker>
<line>Most thankfully, my lord.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Will you indeed?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BOTH.</speaker>
<line>Doubt it not, worthy lord.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line>There&#8217;s never a one of you but trusts a knave</line>
<line>That mightily deceives you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BOTH.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Do we, my lord?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line>Ay, and you hear him cog, see him dissemble,</line>
<line>Know his gross patchery, love him, feed him,</line>
<line>Keep in your bosom; yet remain assur&#8217;d</line>
<line>That he&#8217;s a made-up villain.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAIN.</speaker>
<line>I know none such, my lord.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>POET.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Nor I.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line>Look you, I love you well, I&#8217;ll give you gold,</line>
<line>Rid me these villains from your companies;</line>
<line>Hang them, or stab them, drown them in a draught,</line>
<line>Confound them by some course, and come to me,</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll give you gold enough.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BOTH.</speaker>
<line>Name them, my lord, let&#8217;s know them.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line>You that way and you this; but two in company;</line>
<line>Each man apart, all single and alone,</line>
<line>Yet an arch-villain keeps him company.</line>

<stagedir>To one.</stagedir>
<line>If where thou art, two villains shall not be,</line>
<line>Come not near him.</line>

<stagedir>To the other.</stagedir>
<line>If thou wouldst not reside</line>
<line>But where one villain is, then him abandon.&#8212;</line>
<line>Hence, pack! There&#8217;s gold; you came for gold, ye slaves.</line>

<stagedir>To one.</stagedir>
<line>You have work for me; there&#8217;s payment, hence!</line>
<stagedir>To the other.</stagedir>
<line>You are an alcumist, make gold of that.</line>
<line>Out, rascal dogs!</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exeunt both, driven out by Timon, who retires to his cave.</stagedir>

<stagedir>Enter Steward Flavius and two Senators.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>FLAV.</speaker>
<line>It is vain that you would speak with Timon;</line>
<line>For he is set so only to himself,</line>
<line>That nothing but himself which looks like man</line>
<line>Is friendly with him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. SEN.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Bring us to his cave.</line>
<line>It is our part and promise to th&#8217; Athenians</line>

<speech>
<speaker>2. SEN.</speaker>
<line offset="5">At all times alike</line>
<line>Men are not still the same; &#8217;twas time and griefs</line>

<line>Offering the fortunes of his former days,</line>
<line>The former man may make him. Bring us to him,</line>
<line>And chance it as it may.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FLAV.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Here is his cave.</line>
<line>Peace and content be here! Lord Timon! Timon,</line>
<line>Look out and speak to friends. Th&#8217; Athenians</line>
<line>By two of their most reverend Senate greet thee.</line>
<line>Speak to them, noble Timon.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Timon out of his cave.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line>Thou sun that comforts, burn! Speak and be hang&#8217;d.</line>
<line>For each true word, a blister, and each false</line>
<line>Be as a cantherizing to the root o&#8217; th&#8217; tongue,</line>
<line>Consuming it with speaking!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. SEN.</speaker>
<line offset="6">Worthy Timon&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line>Of none but such as you, and you of Timon.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. SEN.</speaker>
<line>The senators of Athens greet thee, Timon.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line>I thank them, and would send them back the plague,</line>
<line>Could I but catch it for them.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. SEN.</speaker>
<line offset="6">O, forget</line>
<line>What we are sorry for ourselves in thee.</line>
<line>The senators with one consent of love</line>
<line>Entreat thee back to Athens, who have thought</line>
<line>On special dignities, which vacant lie,</line>
<line>For thy best use and wearing.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. SEN.</speaker>
<line offset="6">They confess</line>
<line>Toward thee forgetfulness too general gross;</line>
<line>Which now the public body, which doth seldom</line>
<line>Play the recanter, feeling in itself</line>
<line>A lack of Timon&#8217;s aid, hath sense withal</line>
<line>Of it own fall, restraining aid to Timon,</line>
<line>And send forth us to make their sorrowed render,</line>
<line>Together with a recompense more fruitful</line>
<line>Than their offense can weigh down by the dram;</line>
<line>Ay, even such heaps and sums of love and wealth</line>
<line>As shall to thee blot out what wrongs were theirs,</line>
<line>And write in thee the figures of their love,</line>
<line>Ever to read them thine.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line offset="5">You witch me in it;</line>
<line>Surprise me to the very brink of tears.</line>
<line>Lend me a fool&#8217;s heart and a woman&#8217;s eyes,</line>
<line>And I&#8217;ll beweep these comforts, worthy senators.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. SEN.</speaker>
<line>Therefore so please thee to return with us,</line>
<line>And of our Athens, thine and ours, to take</line>
<line>The captainship, thou shalt be met with thanks,</line>
<line>Allow&#8217;d with absolute power, and thy good name</line>
<line>Live with authority; so soon we shall drive back</line>
<line>Of Alcibiades th&#8217; approaches wild,</line>
<line>Who, like a boar too savage, doth root up</line>
<line>His country&#8217;s peace.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. SEN.</speaker>
<line offset="4">And shakes his threat&#8217;ning sword</line>
<line>Against the walls of Athens.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. SEN.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Therefore, Timon&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line>Well, sir, I will; therefore I will, sir, thus:</line>
<line>If Alcibiades kill my countrymen,</line>
<line>Let Alcibiades know this of Timon,</line>
<line>That Timon cares not. But if he sack fair Athens,</line>
<line>And take our goodly aged men by th&#8217; beards,</line>
<line>Giving our holy virgins to the stain</line>
<line>Of contumelious, beastly, mad-brain&#8217;d war,</line>
<line>Then let him know, and tell him Timon speaks it,</line>
<line>In pity of our aged and our youth,</line>
<line>I cannot choose but tell him that I care not,</line>
<line>And let him take&#8217;t at worst&#8212;for their knives care not,</line>
<line>While you have throats to answer. For myself,</line>
<line>There&#8217;s not a whittle in th&#8217; unruly camp</line>
<line>But I do prize it at my love before</line>
<line>The reverend&#8217;st throat in Athens. So I leave you</line>
<line>To the protection of the prosperous gods,</line>
<line>As thieves to keepers.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FLAV.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Stay not, all&#8217;s in vain.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line>Why, I was writing of my epitaph;</line>
<line>It will be seen tomorrow. My long sickness</line>
<line>Of health and living now begins to mend,</line>
<line>And nothing brings me all things. Go, live still;</line>
<line>Be Alcibiades your plague, you his,</line>
<line>And last so long enough!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. SEN.</speaker>
<line offset="5">We speak in vain.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line>But yet I love my country, and am not</line>
<line>One that rejoices in the common wrack,</line>
<line>As common bruit doth put it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. SEN.</speaker>
<line offset="6">That&#8217;s well spoke.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line>Commend me to my loving countrymen&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. SEN.</speaker>
<line>These words become your lips as they pass thorough them.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. SEN.</speaker>
<line>And enter in our ears like great triumphers</line>
<line>In their applauding gates.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Commend me to them,</line>
<line>And tell them that, to ease them of their griefs,</line>
<line>Their fears of hostile strokes, their aches, losses,</line>
<line>Their pangs of love, with other incident throes</line>
<line>That nature&#8217;s fragile vessel doth sustain</line>
<line>In life&#8217;s uncertain voyage, I will some kindness do them:</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll teach them to prevent wild Alcibiades&#8217; wrath.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. SEN.</speaker>
<line>I like this well, he will return again.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line>I have a tree, which grows here in my close,</line>
<line>That mine own use invites me to cut down,</line>
<line>And shortly must I fell it. Tell my friends,</line>
<line>Tell Athens, in the sequence of degree,</line>
<line>From high to low throughout, that whoso please</line>
<line>To stop affliction, let him take his haste,</line>
<line>Come hither, ere my tree hath felt the axe,</line>
<line>And hang himself. I pray you do my greeting.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FLAV.</speaker>
<line>Trouble him no further, thus you still shall find him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TIM.</speaker>
<line>Come not to me again, but say to Athens,</line>
<line>Timon hath made his everlasting mansion</line>
<line>Upon the beached verge of the salt flood,</line>
<line>Who once a day with his embossed froth</line>
<line>The turbulent surge shall cover; thither come,</line>
<line>And let my grave-stone be your oracle.</line>
<line>Lips, let four words go by and language end!</line>
<line>What is amiss, plague and infection mend!</line>
<line>Graves only be men&#8217;s works, and death their gain!</line>
<line>Sun, hide thy beams, Timon hath done his reign.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit Timon.</stagedir>

<speaker>1. SEN.</speaker>
<line>His discontents are unremovably</line>
<line>Coupled to nature.</line>
</speech>

<line>With my more noble meaning, not a man</line>
<line>Shall pass his quarter, or offend the stream</line>
<line>Of regular justice in your city&#8217;s bounds,</line>
<line>But shall be remedied to your public laws</line>
<line>At heaviest answer.</line>

<speaker>SOLD.</speaker>
<line>My noble general, Timon is dead,</line>
<line>Entomb&#8217;d upon the very hem o&#8217; th&#8217; sea,</line>
<line>And on his grave-stone this insculpture, which</line>
<line>With wax I brought away, whose soft impression</line>
<line>Interprets for my poor ignorance.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ALCIB.</speaker>
<stagedir>Reads the epitaph.</stagedir>
<line><RECITE>&#8220;Here lies a wretched corse, of wretched soul bereft;</RECITE></line>
<line><RECITE>Seek not my name: a plague consume you, wicked caitiffs left!</RECITE></line>
<line><RECITE>Here lie I, Timon, who, alive, all living men did hate;</RECITE></line>
<line><RECITE>Pass by and curse thy fill, but pass and stay not here thy gait.&#8221;</RECITE></line>
<line>These well express in thee thy latter spirits:</line>
<line>Though thou abhorr&#8217;dst in us our human griefs,</line>
<line>Scorn&#8217;dst our brains&#8217; flow, and those our droplets which</line>
<line>From niggard nature fall, yet rich conceit</line>
<line>Taught thee to make vast Neptune weep for aye</line>
<line>On thy low grave, on faults forgiven. Dead</line>
<line>Is noble Timon, of whose memory</line>
<line>Hereafter more. Bring me into your city,</line>
<line>And I will use the olive with my sword:</line>
<line>Make war breed peace, make peace stint war, make each</line>
<line>Prescribe to other as each other&#8217;s leech.</line>
<line>Let our drums strike.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exeunt.</stagedir>
