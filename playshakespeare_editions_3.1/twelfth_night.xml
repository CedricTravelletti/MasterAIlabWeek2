<speech>
<speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
<line>If music be the food of love, play on,</line>
<line>Give me excess of it; that surfeiting,</line>
<line>The appetite may sicken, and so die.</line>
<line>That strain again, it had a dying fall;</line>
<line>O, it came o&#8217;er my ear like the sweet sound</line>
<line>That breathes upon a bank of violets,</line>
<line>Stealing and giving odor. Enough, no more,</line>
<line>&#8217;Tis not so sweet now as it was before.</line>
<line>O spirit of love, how quick and fresh art thou,</line>
<line>That notwithstanding thy capacity</line>
<line>Receiveth as the sea, nought enters there,</line>
<line>Of what validity and pitch soe&#8217;er,</line>
<line>But falls into abatement and low price</line>
<line>Even in a minute. So full of shapes is fancy</line>
<line>That it alone is high fantastical.</line>

<line>Will you go hunt, my lord?</line>

<line offset="8">The hart.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
<line>Why, so I do, the noblest that I have.</line>
<line>O, when mine eyes did see Olivia first,</line>
<line>Methought she purg&#8217;d the air of pestilence!</line>
<line>That instant was I turn&#8217;d into a hart,</line>
<line>And my desires, like fell and cruel hounds,</line>
<line>E&#8217;er since pursue me.</line>

<stagedir>Enter Valentine.</stagedir>

<line offset="4">How now, what news from her?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>So please my lord, I might not be admitted,</line>
<line>But from her handmaid do return this answer:</line>
<line>The element itself, till seven years&#8217; heat,</line>
<line>Shall not behold her face at ample view;</line>
<line>But like a cloistress she will veiled walk,</line>
<line>And water once a day her chamber round</line>
<line>With eye-offending brine; all this to season</line>
<line>A brother&#8217;s dead love, which she would keep fresh</line>
<line>And lasting in her sad remembrance.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
<line>O, she that hath a heart of that fine frame</line>
<line>To pay this debt of love but to a brother,</line>
<line>How will she love when the rich golden shaft</line>
<line>Hath kill&#8217;d the flock of all affections else</line>
<line>That live in her; when liver, brain, and heart,</line>
<line>These sovereign thrones, are all supplied and fill&#8217;d</line>
<line>Her sweet perfections with one self king!</line>
<line>Away before me to sweet beds of flow&#8217;rs,</line>
<line>Love-thoughts lie rich when canopied with bow&#8217;rs.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>VIO.</speaker>
<line>What country, friends, is this?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CAP.</speaker>
<line>This is Illyria, lady.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VIO.</speaker>
<line>And what should I do in Illyria?</line>
<line>My brother he is in Elysium.</line>
<line>Perchance he is not drown&#8217;d&#8212;what think you, sailors?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CAP.</speaker>
<line>It is perchance that you yourself were saved.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VIO.</speaker>
<line>O my poor brother! And so perchance may he be.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CAP.</speaker>
<line>True, madam, and to comfort you with chance,</line>
<line>Assure yourself, after our ship did split,</line>
<line>When you, and those poor number saved with you,</line>
<line>Hung on our driving boat, I saw your brother,</line>
<line>Most provident in peril, bind himself</line>
<line>(Courage and hope both teaching him the practice)</line>
<line>To a strong mast that liv&#8217;d upon the sea;</line>
<line>Where like Arion on the dolphin&#8217;s back,</line>
<line>I saw him hold acquaintance with the waves</line>
<line>So long as I could see.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VIO.</speaker>
<line>For saying so, there&#8217;s gold.</line>
<line>Mine own escape unfoldeth to my hope,</line>
<line>Whereto thy speech serves for authority,</line>
<line>The like of him. Know&#8217;st thou this country?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CAP.</speaker>
<line>Ay, madam, well, for I was bred and born</line>
<line>Not three hours&#8217; travel from this very place.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VIO.</speaker>
<line>Who governs here?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CAP.</speaker>
<line>A noble duke, in nature as in name.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VIO.</speaker>
<line>What is his name?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CAP.</speaker>
<line>Orsino.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VIO.</speaker>
<line>Orsino! I have heard my father name him. He was a bachelor then.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CAP.</speaker>
<line>And so is now, or was so very late;</line>
<line>For but a month ago I went from hence,</line>
<line>And then &#8217;twas fresh in murmur (as you know</line>
<line>What great ones do, the less will prattle of)</line>
<line>That he did seek the love of fair Olivia.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VIO.</speaker>
<line>What&#8217;s she?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CAP.</speaker>
<line>A virtuous maid, the daughter of a count</line>
<line>That died some twelvemonth since, then leaving her</line>
<line>In the protection of his son, her brother,</line>
<line>Who shortly also died; for whose dear love,</line>
<line>They say, she hath abjur&#8217;d the company</line>
<line>And sight of men.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VIO.</speaker>
<line offset="4">O that I serv&#8217;d that lady,</line>
<line>And might not be delivered to the world</line>
<line>Till I had made mine own occasion mellow</line>
<line>What my estate is!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CAP.</speaker>
<line offset="4">That were hard to compass,</line>
<line>Because she will admit no kind of suit,</line>
<line>No, not the Duke&#8217;s.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VIO.</speaker>
<line>There is a fair behavior in thee, captain,</line>
<line>And though that nature with a beauteous wall</line>
<line>Doth oft close in pollution, yet of thee</line>
<line>I will believe thou hast a mind that suits</line>
<line>With this thy fair and outward character.</line>
<line>I prithee (and I&#8217;ll pay thee bounteously)</line>
<line>Conceal me what I am, and be my aid</line>
<line>For such disguise as haply shall become</line>
<line>The form of my intent. I&#8217;ll serve this duke;</line>
<line>Thou shalt present me as an eunuch to him,</line>
<line>It may be worth thy pains; for I can sing</line>
<line>And speak to him in many sorts of music</line>
<line>That will allow me very worth his service.</line>
<line>What else may hap, to time I will commit,</line>
<line>Only shape thou thy silence to my wit.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CAP.</speaker>
<line>Be you his eunuch, and your mute I&#8217;ll be;</line>
<line>When my tongue blabs, then let mine eyes not see.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VIO.</speaker>
<line>I thank thee. Lead me on.</line>

<scenepersonae>(Sir Toby Belch, Maria, Sir Andrew Aguecheek)</scenepersonae>

<stagedir>Enter Sir Toby Belch and Maria.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR TO.</speaker>
<line>What a plague means my niece to take the death of her brother thus? I am sure care&#8217;s an enemy to life.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MAR.</speaker>
<line>By my troth, Sir Toby, you must come in earlier a&#8217; nights. Your cousin, my lady, takes great exceptions to your ill hours.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR TO.</speaker>
<line>Why, let her except before excepted.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MAR.</speaker>
<line>Ay, but you must confine yourself within the modest limits of order.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR TO.</speaker>
<line>Confine? I&#8217;ll confine myself no finer than I am. These clothes are good enough to drink in, and so be these boots too; and they be not, let them hang themselves in their own straps.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MAR.</speaker>
<line>That quaffing and drinking will undo you. I heard my lady talk of it yesterday; and of a foolish knight that you brought in one night here to be her wooer.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR TO.</speaker>
<line>Who, Sir Andrew Aguecheek?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MAR.</speaker>
<line>Ay, he.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR TO.</speaker>
<line>He&#8217;s as tall a man as any&#8217;s in Illyria.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MAR.</speaker>
<line>What&#8217;s that to th&#8217; purpose?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR TO.</speaker>
<line>Why, he has three thousand ducats a year.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MAR.</speaker>
<line>Ay, but he&#8217;ll have but a year in all these ducats. He&#8217;s a very fool and a prodigal.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR TO.</speaker>
<line>Fie, that You&#8217;ll say so! He plays o&#8217; th&#8217; viol-de-gamboys, and speaks three or four languages word for word without book, and hath all the good gifts of nature.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MAR.</speaker>
<line>He hath indeed, almost natural; for besides that he&#8217;s a fool, he&#8217;s a great quarreller; and but that he hath the gift of a coward to allay the gust he hath in quarrelling, &#8217;tis thought among the prudent he would quickly have the gift of a grave.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR TO.</speaker>
<line>By this hand, they are scoundrels and sub-stractors that say so of him. Who are they?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MAR.</speaker>
<line>They that add moreov&#8217;r, he&#8217;s drunk nightly in your company.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR TO.</speaker>
<line>With drinking healths to my niece. I&#8217;ll drink to her as long as there is a passage in my throat, and drink in Illyria. He&#8217;s a coward and a coystrill that will not drink to my niece till his brains turn o&#8217; th&#8217; toe like a parish-top. What, wench! Castiliano vulgo! For here comes Sir Andrew Agueface.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Sir Andrew Aguecheek.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR AND.</speaker>
<line>Sir Toby Belch! How now, Sir Toby Belch?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR TO.</speaker>
<line>Sweet Sir Andrew!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR AND.</speaker>
<line>Bless you, fair shrew.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MAR.</speaker>
<line>And you too, sir.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR TO.</speaker>
<line>Accost, Sir Andrew, accost.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR AND.</speaker>
<line>What&#8217;s that?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR TO.</speaker>
<line>My niece&#8217;s chambermaid.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR AND.</speaker>
<line>Good Mistress Accost, I desire better acquaintance.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MAR.</speaker>
<line>My name is Mary, sir.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR AND.</speaker>
<line>Good Mistress Mary Accost&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR TO.</speaker>
<line>You mistake, knight. &#8220;Accost&#8221; is front her, board her, woo her, assail her.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR AND.</speaker>
<line>By my troth, I would not undertake her in this company. Is that the meaning of &#8220;accost&#8221;?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MAR.</speaker>
<line>Fare you well, gentlemen.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR TO.</speaker>
<line>And thou let part so, Sir Andrew, would thou mightst never draw sword again.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR AND.</speaker>
<line>And you part so, mistress, I would I might never draw sword again. Fair lady, do you think you have fools in hand?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MAR.</speaker>
<line>Sir, I have not you by th&#8217; hand.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR AND.</speaker>
<line>Marry, but you shall have&#8212;and here&#8217;s my hand.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MAR.</speaker>
<line>Now, sir, thought is free. I pray you bring your hand to th&#8217; butt&#8217;ry-bar, and let it drink.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR AND.</speaker>
<line>Wherefore, sweetheart? What&#8217;s your metaphor?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MAR.</speaker>
<line>It&#8217;s dry, sir.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR AND.</speaker>
<line>Why, I think so. I am not such an ass but I can keep my hand dry. But what&#8217;s your jest?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MAR.</speaker>
<line>A dry jest, sir.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR AND.</speaker>
<line>Are you full of them?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MAR.</speaker>
<line>Ay, sir, I have them at my fingers&#8217; ends. Marry, now I let go your hand, I am barren.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit Maria.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR TO.</speaker>
<line>O knight, thou lack&#8217;st a cup of canary. When did I see thee so put down?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR AND.</speaker>
<line>Never in your life I think, unless you see canary put me down. Methinks sometimes I have no more wit than a Christian or an ordinary man has; but I am a great eater of beef, and I believe that does harm to my wit.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR TO.</speaker>
<line>No question.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR AND.</speaker>
<line>And I thought that, I&#8217;d forswear it. I&#8217;ll ride home tomorrow, Sir Toby.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR TO.</speaker>
<line><french xml:lang="fr">Pourquoi</french>, my dear knight?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR AND.</speaker>
<line>What is <french xml:lang="fr">&#8220;pourquoi&#8221;</french>? Do, or not do? I would I had bestow&#8217;d that time in the tongues that I have in fencing, dancing, and bear-baiting. O had I but follow&#8217;d the arts!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR TO.</speaker>
<line>Then hadst thou had an excellent head of hair.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR AND.</speaker>
<line>Why, would that have mended my hair?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR TO.</speaker>
<line>Past question, for thou seest it will not curl by nature.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR AND.</speaker>
<line>But it becomes me well enough, does&#8217;t not?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR TO.</speaker>
<line>Excellent, it hangs like flax on a distaff; and I hope to see a huswife take thee between her legs, and spin it off.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR AND.</speaker>
<line>Faith, I&#8217;ll home tomorrow, Sir Toby. Your niece will not be seen, or if she be, it&#8217;s four to one she&#8217;ll none of me. The Count himself here hard by woos her.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR TO.</speaker>
<line>She&#8217;ll none o&#8217; th&#8217; Count. She&#8217;ll not match above her degree, neither in estate, years, nor wit; I have heard her swear&#8217;t. Tut, there&#8217;s life in&#8217;t, man.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR AND.</speaker>
<line>I&#8217;ll stay a month longer. I am a fellow o&#8217; th&#8217; strangest mind i&#8217; th&#8217; world; I delight in masques and revels sometimes altogether.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR TO.</speaker>
<line>Art thou good at these kickshawses, knight?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR AND.</speaker>
<line>As any man in Illyria, whatsoever he be, under the degree of my betters, and yet I will not compare with an old man.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR TO.</speaker>
<line>What is thy excellence in a galliard, knight?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR AND.</speaker>
<line>Faith, I can cut a caper.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR TO.</speaker>
<line>And I can cut the mutton to&#8217;t.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR AND.</speaker>
<line>And I think I have the back-trick simply as strong as any man in Illyria.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR TO.</speaker>
<line>Wherefore are these things hid? Wherefore have these gifts a curtain before &#8217;em? Are they like to take dust, like Mistress Mall&#8217;s picture? Why dost thou not go to church in a galliard, and come home in a coranto? My very walk should be a jig.</line>
<line>I would not so much as make water but in a sink-a-pace. What dost thou mean? Is it a world to hide virtues in? I did think by the excellent constitution of thy leg, it was form&#8217;d under the star of a galliard.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR AND.</speaker>
<line>Ay, &#8217;tis strong; and it does indifferent well in a dun-color&#8217;d stock. Shall we set about some revels?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR TO.</speaker>
<line>What shall we do else? Were we not born under Taurus?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR AND.</speaker>
<line>Taurus? That&#8217;s sides and heart.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR TO.</speaker>
<line>No, sir, it is legs and thighs. Let me see thee caper. Ha, higher! Ha, ha, excellent!</line>

<line>Wit, and&#8217;t be thy will, put me into good fooling! Those wits that think they have thee do very oft prove fools; and I that am sure I lack thee, may pass for a wise man. For what says Quinapalus? &#8220;Better a witty fool than a foolish wit.&#8221;&#8212;God bless thee, lady!</line>

<line>Two faults, madonna, that drink and good counsel will amend; for give the dry fool drink, then is the fool not dry; bid the dishonest man mend himself: if he mend, he is no longer dishonest; if he cannot, let the botcher mend him. Any thing that&#8217;s mended is but patch&#8217;d; virtue that transgresses is but patch&#8217;d with sin, and sin that amends is but patch&#8217;d with virtue. If that this simple syllogism will serve, so; if it will not, what remedy? As there is no true cuckold but calamity, so beauty&#8217;s a flower. The lady bade take away the fool, therefore I say again, take her away.</line>

<line>By your patience, no. My stars shine darkly over me. The malignancy of my fate might perhaps distemper yours; therefore I shall crave of you your leave, that I may bear my evils alone. It were a bad recompense for your love, to lay any of them on you.</line>

<line>No, sooth, sir; my determinate voyage is mere extravagancy. But I perceive in you so excellent a touch of modesty, that you will not extort from me what I am willing to keep in; therefore it charges me in manners the rather to express myself. You must know of me then, Antonio, my name is Sebastian, which I call&#8217;d Rodorigo; my father was that Sebastian of Messaline, whom I know you have heard of. He left behind him myself and a sister, both born in an hour. If the heavens had been pleas&#8217;d, would we had so ended!

<line>Even now, sir; on a moderate pace I have since arriv&#8217;d but hither.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>MAL.</speaker>
<line>She returns this ring to you, sir. You might have sav&#8217;d me my pains, to have taken it away yourself. She adds moreover, that you should put your lord into a desperate assurance she will none of him. And one thing more, that you be never so hardy to come again in his affairs, unless it be to report your lord&#8217;s taking of this. Receive it so.</line>

<line>She loves me sure, the cunning of her passion</line>
<line>Invites me in this churlish messenger.</line>
<line>None of my lord&#8217;s ring? Why, he sent her none.</line>
<line>I am the man! If it be so, as &#8217;tis,</line>
<line>Poor lady, she were better love a dream.</line>

<line>Alas, our frailty is the cause, not we,</line>

<line>How will this fadge? My master loves her dearly,</line>
<line>And I (poor monster) fond as much on him;</line>
<line>And she (mistaken) seems to dote on me.</line>
<line>What will become of this? As I am man,</line>
<line>My state is desperate for my master&#8217;s love;</line>
<line>As I am woman (now alas the day!),</line>

<line>A false conclusion. I hate it as an unfill&#8217;d can. To be up after midnight and to go to bed then, is early; so that to go to bed after midnight is to go to bed betimes. Does not our lives consist of the four elements?</line>

<line>Prizes not quantity of dirty lands;</line>
<line>The parts that fortune hath bestow&#8217;d upon her,</line>
<line>Tell her, I hold as giddily as fortune;</line>

<line offset="5">Sooth, but you must.</line>

<line>You tell her so. Must she not then be answer&#8217;d?</line>

<speech>
<speaker>DUKE.</speaker>
<line>There is no woman&#8217;s sides</line>

<line>As love doth give my heart; no woman&#8217;s heart</line>
<line>So big, to hold so much; they lack retention.</line>
<line>Alas, their love may be call&#8217;d appetite,</line>
<line>No motion of the liver, but the palate,</line>
<line>That suffer surfeit, cloyment, and revolt,</line>
<line>But mine is all as hungry as the sea,</line>

<line>Too well what love women to men may owe;</line>

<line>Feed on her damask cheek; she pin&#8217;d in thought,</line>
<line>And with a green and yellow melancholy</line>
<line>She sate like Patience on a monument,</line>
<line>Smiling at grief. Was not this love indeed?</line>
<line>We men may say more, swear more, but indeed</line>
<line>Our shows are more than will; for still we prove</line>

<line>&#8220;I may command where I adore.&#8221; Why, she may command me: I serve her, she is my lady. Why, this is evident to any formal capacity, there is no obstruction in this.

<line><RECITE>&#8220;If this fall into thy hand, revolve. In my stars I am above thee, but be not afraid of greatness. Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon &#8217;em. Thy Fates open their hands, let thy blood and spirit embrace them, and to inure thyself to what thou art like to be, cast thy humble slough and appear fresh. Be opposite with a kinsman, surly with servants; let thy tongue tang arguments of state; put thyself into the trick of singularity. She thus advises thee that sighs for thee. Remember who commended thy yellow stockings, and wish&#8217;d to see thee ever cross-garter&#8217;d: I say, remember. Go to, thou art made if thou desir&#8217;st to be so; if not, let me see thee a steward still, the fellow of servants, and not worthy to touch Fortune&#8217;s fingers. Farewell.

I will be proud, I will read politic authors, I will baffle Sir Toby, I will wash off gross acquaintance, I will be point-devise the very man. I do not now fool myself, to let imagination jade me; for every reason excites to this, that my lady loves me. She did commend my yellow stockings of late, she did praise my leg being cross-garter&#8217;d, and in this she manifests herself to my love, and with a kind of injunction drives me to these habits of her liking. I thank my stars, I am happy. I will be strange, stout, in yellow stockings, and cross-garter&#8217;d, even with the swiftness of putting on. Jove and my stars be prais&#8217;d!

<line>This fellow is wise enough to play the fool,</line>
<line>And to do that well craves a kind of wit.</line>
<line>He must observe their mood on whom he jests,</line>
<line>The quality of persons, and the time;</line>
<line>And like the haggard, check at every feather</line>
<line>That comes before his eye. This is a practice</line>
<line>As full of labor as a wise man&#8217;s art;</line>
<line>For folly that he wisely shows is fit,</line>
<line>But wise men, folly-fall&#8217;n, quite taint their wit.</line>

<line>My duty, madam, and most humble service.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OLI.</speaker>
<line>What is your name?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VIO.</speaker>
<line>Cesario is your servant&#8217;s name, fair princess.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OLI.</speaker>
<line>My servant, sir? &#8217;Twas never merry world</line>
<line>Since lowly feigning was call&#8217;d compliment.</line>
<line>Y&#8217; are servant to the Count Orsino, youth.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VIO.</speaker>
<line>And he is yours, and his must needs be yours:</line>
<line>Your servant&#8217;s servant is your servant, madam.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OLI.</speaker>
<line>For him, I think not on him. For his thoughts,</line>
<line>Would they were blanks, rather than fill&#8217;d with me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VIO.</speaker>
<line>Madam, I come to whet your gentle thoughts</line>
<line>On his behalf.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OLI.</speaker>
<line offset="3">O, by your leave, I pray you:</line>
<line>I bade you never speak again of him;</line>
<line>But would you undertake another suit,</line>
<line>I had rather hear you to solicit that</line>
<line>Than music from the spheres.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VIO.</speaker>
<line offset="6">Dear lady&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OLI.</speaker>
<line>Give me leave, beseech you. I did send,</line>
<line>After the last enchantment you did here,</line>
<line>A ring in chase of you; so did I abuse</line>
<line>Myself, my servant, and I fear me you.</line>
<line>Under your hard construction must I sit,</line>
<line>To force that on you in a shameful cunning</line>
<line>Which you knew none of yours. What might you think?</line>
<line>Have you not set mine honor at the stake,</line>
<line>And baited it with all th&#8217; unmuzzled thoughts</line>
<line>That tyrannous heart can think? To one of your receiving</line>
<line>Enough is shown; a cypress, not a bosom,</line>
<line>Hides my heart. So let me hear you speak.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VIO.</speaker>
<line>I pity you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OLI.</speaker>
<line offset="3">That&#8217;s a degree to love.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VIO.</speaker>
<line>No, not a grize; for &#8217;tis a vulgar proof</line>
<line>That very oft we pity enemies.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OLI.</speaker>
<line>Why then methinks &#8217;tis time to smile again.</line>
<line>O world, how apt the poor are to be proud!</line>
<line>If one should be a prey, how much the better</line>
<line>To fall before the lion than the wolf!</line>

<stagedir>Clock strikes.</stagedir>
<line>The clock upbraids me with the waste of time.</line>
<line>Be not afraid, good youth, I will not have you,</line>
<line>And yet when wit and youth is come to harvest,</line>
<line>Your wife is like to reap a proper man.</line>
<line>There lies your way, due west.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VIO.</speaker>
<line offset="6">Then westward-ho!</line>
<line>Grace and good disposition attend your ladyship!</line>
<line>You&#8217;ll nothing, madam, to my lord by me?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OLI.</speaker>
<line>Stay!</line>
<line>I prithee tell me what thou think&#8217;st of me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VIO.</speaker>
<line>That you do think you are not what you are.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OLI.</speaker>
<line>If I think so, I think the same of you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VIO.</speaker>
<line>Then think you right: I am not what I am.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OLI.</speaker>
<line>I would you were as I would have you be.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VIO.</speaker>
<line>Would it be better, madam, than I am?</line>
<line>I wish it might, for now I am your fool.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OLI.</speaker>
<stagedir>Aside.</stagedir>
<line>O, what a deal of scorn looks beautiful</line>
<line>In the contempt and anger of his lip!</line>
<line>A murd&#8217;rous guilt shows not itself more soon</line>
<line>Than love that would seem hid: love&#8217;s night is noon.&#8212;</line>
<line>Cesario, by the roses of the spring,</line>
<line>By maidhood, honor, truth, and every thing,</line>
<line>I love thee so, that maugre all thy pride,</line>
<line>Nor wit nor reason can my passion hide.</line>
<line>Do not extort thy reasons from this clause,</line>
<line>For that I woo, thou therefore hast no cause;</line>
<line>But rather reason thus with reason fetter:</line>
<line>Love sought is good, but given unsought is better.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VIO.</speaker>
<line>By innocence I swear, and by my youth,</line>
<line>I have one heart, one bosom, and one truth,</line>
<line>And that no woman has, nor never none</line>
<line>Shall mistress be of it, save I alone.</line>
<line>And so <french xml:lang="fr">adieu</french>, good madam, never more</line>
<line>Will I my master&#8217;s tears to you deplore.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OLI.</speaker>
<line>Yet come again; for thou perhaps mayst move</line>
<line>That heart which now abhors, to like his love.</line>

<speaker>SIR AND.</speaker>
<line>No, faith, I&#8217;ll not stay a jot longer.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR TO.</speaker>
<line>Thy reason, dear venom, give thy reason.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FAB.</speaker>
<line>You must needs yield your reason, Sir Andrew.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR AND.</speaker>
<line>Marry, I saw your niece do more favors to the Count&#8217;s servingman than ever she bestow&#8217;d upon me. I saw&#8217;t i&#8217; th&#8217; orchard.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR TO.</speaker>
<line>Did she see thee the while, old boy? Tell me that.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR AND.</speaker>
<line>As plain as I see you now.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FAB.</speaker>
<line>This was a great argument of love in her toward you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR AND.</speaker>
<line>&#8217;Slight! Will you make an ass o&#8217; me?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FAB.</speaker>
<line>I will prove it legitimate, sir, upon the oaths of judgment and reason.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR TO.</speaker>
<line>And they have been grand-jurymen since before Noah was a sailor.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FAB.</speaker>
<line>She did show favor to the youth in your sight only to exasperate you, to awake your dormouse valor, to put fire in your heart, and brimstone in your liver. You should then have accosted her, and with some excellent jests, fire-new from the mint, you should have bang&#8217;d the youth into dumbness. This was look&#8217;d for at your hand, and this was balk&#8217;d. The double gilt of this opportunity you let time wash off, and you are now sail&#8217;d into the north of my lady&#8217;s opinion, where you will hang like an icicle on a Dutchman&#8217;s beard, unless you do redeem it by some laudable attempt either of valor or policy.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR AND.</speaker>
<line>And&#8217;t be any way, it must be with valor, for policy I hate. I had as lief be a Brownist as a politician.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR TO.</speaker>
<line>Why then build me thy fortunes upon the basis of valor. Challenge me the Count&#8217;s youth to fight with him, hurt him in eleven places&#8212;my niece shall take note of it, and assure thyself, there is no love-broker in the world can more prevail in man&#8217;s commendation with woman than report of valor.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FAB.</speaker>
<line>There is no way but this, Sir Andrew.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR AND.</speaker>
<line>Will either of you bear me a challenge to him?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR TO.</speaker>
<line>Go, write it in a martial hand, be curst and brief. It is no matter how witty, so it be eloquent and full of invention. Taunt him with the license of ink. If thou thou&#8217;st him some thrice, it shall not be amiss; and as many lies as will lie in thy sheet of paper, although the sheet were big enough for the bed of Ware in England, set &#8217;em down. Go about it. Let there be gall enough in thy ink, though thou write with a goose-pen, no matter. About it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR AND.</speaker>
<line>Where shall I find you?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR TO.</speaker>
<line>We&#8217;ll call thee at the cubiculo. Go.</line>

<line>I have been dear to him, lad, some two thousand strong, or so.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FAB.</speaker>
<line>We shall have a rare letter from him; but You&#8217;ll not deliver&#8217;t?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR TO.</speaker>
<line>Never trust me then; and by all means stir on the youth to an answer. I think oxen and wain-ropes cannot hale them together. For Andrew, if he were open&#8217;d and you find so much blood in his liver as will clog the foot of a flea, I&#8217;ll eat the rest of th&#8217; anatomy.</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MAR.</speaker>
<line>If you desire the spleen, and will laugh yourselves into stitches, follow me. Yond gull Malvolio is turn&#8217;d heathen, a very renegado; for there is no Christian that means to be sav&#8217;d by believing rightly can ever believe such impossible passages of grossness. He&#8217;s in yellow stockings.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR TO.</speaker>
<line>And cross-garter&#8217;d?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MAR.</speaker>
<line>Most villainously; like a pedant that keeps a school i&#8217; th&#8217; church. I have dogg&#8217;d him like his murderer. He does obey every point of the letter that I dropp&#8217;d to betray him. He does smile his face into more lines than is in the new map, with the augmentation of the Indies; you have not seen such a thing as &#8217;tis. I can hardly forbear hurling things at him. I know my lady will strike him. If she do, he&#8217;ll smile, and take&#8217;t for a great favor.</line>

<line>I could not stay behind you. My desire</line>

<line>But jealousy what might befall your travel,</line>
<line>Being skilless in these parts; which to a stranger,</line>

<line>It might have since been answer&#8217;d in repaying</line>

This concurs directly with the letter: she sends him on purpose, that I may appear stubborn to him; for she incites me to that in the letter. &#8220;Cast thy humble slough,&#8221; says she; &#8220;be opposite with a kinsman, surly with servants; let thy tongue tang with arguments of state; put thyself into the trick of singularity&#8221;; and consequently sets down the manner how: as a sad face, a reverend carriage, a slow tongue, in the habit of some sir of note, and so forth. I have lim&#8217;d her, but it is Jove&#8217;s doing, and Jove make me thankful! And when she went away now, &#8220;Let this fellow be look&#8217;d to&#8221;; &#8220;fellow&#8221;! Not &#8220;Malvolio,&#8221; nor after my degree, but &#8220;fellow.&#8221; Why, every thing adheres together, that no dram of a scruple, no scruple of a scruple, no obstacle, no incredulous or unsafe circumstance&#8212;What can be said? Nothing that can be can come between me and the full prospect of my hopes. Well, Jove, not I, is the doer of this, and he is to be thank&#8217;d.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR TO.</speaker>
<line>Which way is he, in the name of sanctity? If all the devils of hell be drawn in little, and Legion himself possess&#8217;d him, yet I&#8217;ll speak to him.</line>

<line>Ah ha, does she so?</line>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR TO.</speaker>
<line>Go to, go to; peace, peace, we must deal gently with him. Let me alone. How do you, Malvolio? How is&#8217;t with you? What, man, defy the devil! Consider, he&#8217;s an enemy to mankind.</line>

<line>Come, we&#8217;ll have him in a dark room and bound. My niece is already in the belief that he&#8217;s mad.

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR TO.</speaker>
<line>Go, Sir Andrew, scout me for him at the corner of the orchard like a burn-baily. So soon as ever thou seest him, draw, and as thou draw&#8217;st, swear horrible; for it comes to pass oft that a terrible oath, with a swaggering accent sharply twang&#8217;d off, gives manhood more approbation than ever proof itself would have earn&#8217;d him. Away!</line>

<line>Nay, let me alone for swearing.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR TO.</speaker>
<line>Now will not I deliver his letter; for the behavior of the young gentleman gives him out to be of good capacity and breeding; his employment between his lord and my niece confirms no less. Therefore this letter, being so excellently ignorant, will breed no terror in the youth; he will find it comes from a clodpole. But, sir, I will deliver his challenge by word of mouth, set upon Aguecheek a notable report of valor, and drive the gentleman (as I know his youth will aptly receive it) into a most hideous opinion of his rage, skill, fury, and impetuosity. This will so fright them both that they will kill one another by the look, like cockatrices.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Olivia and Viola.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>FAB.</speaker>
<line>Here he comes with your niece. Give them way till he take leave, and presently after him.</line>

<line>I have said too much unto a heart of stone,</line>
<line>And laid mine honor too unchary on&#8217;t.</line>

<line>But such a headstrong potent fault it is</line>
<line>That it but mocks reproof.</line>

<line>With the same havior that your passion bears</line>
<line>Goes on my master&#8217;s griefs.</line>

<line>Here, wear this jewel for me, &#8217;tis my picture.</line>
<line>Refuse it not, it hath no tongue to vex you;</line>

<line>That honor, sav&#8217;d, may upon asking give?</line>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR TO.</speaker>
<line>Gentleman, God save thee!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VIO.</speaker>
<line>And you, sir.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR TO.</speaker>
<line>That defense thou hast, betake thee to&#8217;t. Of what nature the wrongs are thou hast done him, I know not; but thy intercepter, full of despite, bloody as the hunter, attends thee at the orchard-end. Dismount thy tuck, be yare in thy preparation, for thy assailant is quick, skillful, and deadly.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VIO.</speaker>
<line>You mistake, sir, I am sure; no man hath any quarrel to me. My remembrance is very free and clear from any image of offense done to any man.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR TO.</speaker>
<line>You&#8217;ll find it otherwise, I assure you; therefore, if you hold your life at any price, betake you to your guard; for your opposite hath in him what youth, strength, skill, and wrath can furnish man withal.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VIO.</speaker>
<line>I pray you, sir, what is he?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR TO.</speaker>
<line>He is knight, dubb&#8217;d with unhatch&#8217;d rapier, and on carpet consideration, but he is a devil in private brawl. Souls and bodies hath he divorc&#8217;d three, and his incensement at this moment is so implacable, that satisfaction can be none but by pangs of death and sepulchre. Hob, nob, is his word; give&#8217;t or take&#8217;t.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VIO.</speaker>
<line>I will return again into the house, and desire some conduct of the lady. I am no fighter. I have heard of some kind of men that put quarrels purposely on others, to taste their valor. Belike this is a man of that quirk.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR TO.</speaker>
<line>Sir, no; his indignation derives itself out of a very competent injury; therefore get you on, and give him his desire. Back you shall not to the house, unless you undertake that with me which with as much safety you might answer him; therefore on, or strip your sword stark naked; for meddle you must, that&#8217;s certain, or forswear to wear iron about you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VIO.</speaker>
<line>This is as uncivil as strange. I beseech you do me this courteous office, as to know of the knight what my offense to him is. It is something of my negligence, nothing of my purpose.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR TO.</speaker>
<line>I will do so. Signior Fabian, stay you by this gentleman till my return.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit Toby.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>VIO.</speaker>
<line>Pray you, sir, do you know of this matter?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FAB.</speaker>
<line>I know the knight is incens&#8217;d against you, even to a mortal arbitrement, but nothing of the circumstance more.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VIO.</speaker>
<line>I beseech you, what manner of man is he?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FAB.</speaker>
<line>Nothing of that wonderful promise, to read him by his form, as you are like to find him in the proof of his valor. He is indeed, sir, the most skillful, bloody, and fatal opposite that you could possibly have found in any part of Illyria. Will you walk towards him? I will make your peace with him if I can.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VIO.</speaker>
<line>I shall be much bound to you for&#8217;t. I am one that had rather go with sir priest than sir knight. I care not who knows so much of my mettle.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exeunt.</stagedir>

<stagedir>Enter Toby and Andrew.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR TO.</speaker>
<line>Why, man, he&#8217;s a very devil, I have not seen such a firago. I had a pass with him, rapier, scabbard, and all; and he gives me the stuck in with such a mortal motion that it is inevitable; and on the answer, he pays you as surely as your feet hits the ground they step on. They say he has been fencer to the Sophy.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR AND.</speaker>
<line>Pox on&#8217;t, I&#8217;ll not meddle with him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR TO.</speaker>
<line>Ay, but he will not now be pacified. Fabian can scarce hold him yonder.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR AND.</speaker>
<line>Plague on&#8217;t, and I thought he had been valiant, and so cunning in fence, I&#8217;d have seen him damn&#8217;d ere I&#8217;d have challeng&#8217;d him. Let him let the matter slip, and I&#8217;ll give him my horse, grey Capilet.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR TO.</speaker>
<line>I&#8217;ll make the motion. Stand here, make a good show on&#8217;t; this shall end without the perdition of souls.</line><stagedir>Aside.</stagedir><line>Marry, I&#8217;ll ride your horse as well as I ride you.</line>

<stagedir>Enter Fabian and Viola.</stagedir>
<stagedir>To Fabian.</stagedir><line>I have his horse to take up the quarrel. I have persuaded him the youth&#8217;s a devil.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FAB.</speaker>
<line>He is as horribly conceited of him; and pants and looks pale, as if a bear were at his heels.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR TO.</speaker>
<stagedir>To Viola.</stagedir><line>There&#8217;s no remedy, sir, he will fight with you for &#8217;s oath sake. Marry, he hath better bethought him of his quarrel, and he finds that now scarce to be worth talking of; therefore draw, for the supportance of his vow. He protests he will not hurt you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VIO.</speaker>
<stagedir>Aside.</stagedir>
<line>Pray God defend me! A little thing would make me tell them how much I lack of a man.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FAB.</speaker>
<line>Give ground if you see him furious.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR TO.</speaker>
<line>Come, Sir Andrew, there&#8217;s no remedy, the gentleman will for his honor&#8217;s sake have one bout with you. He cannot by the duello avoid it; but he has promis&#8217;d me, as he is a gentleman and a soldier, he will not hurt you. Come on, to&#8217;t.</line>

<line type="lyric">When that I was and a little tiny boy,</line>
<line type="lyric">With hey ho, the wind and the rain,</line>
<line type="lyric">A foolish thing was but a toy,</line>
<line type="lyric">For the rain it raineth every day.</line>

<line type="lyric">But when I came to man&#8217;s estate,</line>
<line type="lyric">With hey ho, etc.</line>
<line type="lyric">&#8217;Gainst knaves and thieves men shut their gate,</line>
<line type="lyric">For the rain, etc.</line>

<line type="lyric">But when I came, alas, to wive,</line>
<line type="lyric">With hey ho, etc.</line>
<line type="lyric">By swaggering could I never thrive,</line>
<line type="lyric">For the rain, etc.</line>

<line type="lyric">But when I came unto my beds,</line>
<line type="lyric">With hey ho, etc.</line>
<line type="lyric">With toss-pots still had drunken heads,</line>
<line type="lyric">For the rain, etc.</line>

<line type="lyric">A great while ago the world begun,</line>
<line type="lyric">With hey ho, etc.</line>
<line type="lyric">But that&#8217;s all one, our play is done,</line>
<line type="lyric">And we&#8217;ll strive to please you every day.</line>
