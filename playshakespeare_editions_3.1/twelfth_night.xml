<SPEAKER>DUKE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If music be the food of love, play on,</LINE>
<LINE>Give me excess of it; that surfeiting,</LINE>
<LINE>The appetite may sicken, and so die.</LINE>
<LINE>That strain again, it had a dying fall;</LINE>
<LINE>O, it came o&#8217;er my ear like the sweet sound</LINE>
<LINE>That breathes upon a bank of violets,</LINE>
<LINE>Stealing and giving odor. Enough, no more,</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis not so sweet now as it was before.</LINE>
<LINE>O spirit of love, how quick and fresh art thou,</LINE>
<LINE>That notwithstanding thy capacity</LINE>
<LINE>Receiveth as the sea, nought enters there,</LINE>
<LINE>Of what validity and pitch soe&#8217;er,</LINE>
<LINE>But falls into abatement and low price</LINE>
<LINE>Even in a minute. So full of shapes is fancy</LINE>
<LINE>That it alone is high fantastical.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, so I do, the noblest that I have.</LINE>
<LINE>O, when mine eyes did see Olivia first,</LINE>
<LINE>Methought she purg&#8217;d the air of pestilence!</LINE>
<LINE>That instant was I turn&#8217;d into a hart,</LINE>
<LINE>And my desires, like fell and cruel hounds,</LINE>
<LINE>E&#8217;er since pursue me.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Valentine.</STAGEDIR>

<LINE offset="4">How now, what news from her?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So please my lord, I might not be admitted,</LINE>
<LINE>But from her handmaid do return this answer:</LINE>
<LINE>The element itself, till seven years&#8217; heat,</LINE>
<LINE>Shall not behold her face at ample view;</LINE>
<LINE>But like a cloistress she will veiled walk,</LINE>
<LINE>And water once a day her chamber round</LINE>
<LINE>With eye-offending brine; all this to season</LINE>
<LINE>A brother&#8217;s dead love, which she would keep fresh</LINE>
<LINE>And lasting in her sad remembrance.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, she that hath a heart of that fine frame</LINE>
<LINE>To pay this debt of love but to a brother,</LINE>
<LINE>How will she love when the rich golden shaft</LINE>
<LINE>Hath kill&#8217;d the flock of all affections else</LINE>
<LINE>That live in her; when liver, brain, and heart,</LINE>
<LINE>These sovereign thrones, are all supplied and fill&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>Her sweet perfections with one self king!</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VIO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What country, friends, is this?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This is Illyria, lady.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VIO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And what should I do in Illyria?</LINE>
<LINE>My brother he is in Elysium.</LINE>
<LINE>Perchance he is not drown&#8217;d&#8212;what think you, sailors?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is perchance that you yourself were saved.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VIO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O my poor brother! And so perchance may he be.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>True, madam, and to comfort you with chance,</LINE>
<LINE>Assure yourself, after our ship did split,</LINE>
<LINE>When you, and those poor number saved with you,</LINE>
<LINE>Hung on our driving boat, I saw your brother,</LINE>
<LINE>Most provident in peril, bind himself</LINE>
<LINE>(Courage and hope both teaching him the practice)</LINE>
<LINE>To a strong mast that liv&#8217;d upon the sea;</LINE>
<LINE>Where like Arion on the dolphin&#8217;s back,</LINE>
<LINE>I saw him hold acquaintance with the waves</LINE>
<LINE>So long as I could see.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VIO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For saying so, there&#8217;s gold.</LINE>
<LINE>Mine own escape unfoldeth to my hope,</LINE>
<LINE>Whereto thy speech serves for authority,</LINE>
<LINE>The like of him. Know&#8217;st thou this country?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, madam, well, for I was bred and born</LINE>
<LINE>Not three hours&#8217; travel from this very place.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VIO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who governs here?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A noble duke, in nature as in name.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VIO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What is his name?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Orsino.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VIO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Orsino! I have heard my father name him. He was a bachelor then.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And so is now, or was so very late;</LINE>
<LINE>For but a month ago I went from hence,</LINE>
<LINE>And then &#8217;twas fresh in murmur (as you know</LINE>
<LINE>What great ones do, the less will prattle of)</LINE>
<LINE>That he did seek the love of fair Olivia.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VIO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What&#8217;s she?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A virtuous maid, the daughter of a count</LINE>
<LINE>That died some twelvemonth since, then leaving her</LINE>
<LINE>In the protection of his son, her brother,</LINE>
<LINE>Who shortly also died; for whose dear love,</LINE>
<LINE>They say, she hath abjur&#8217;d the company</LINE>
<LINE>And sight of men.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VIO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">O that I serv&#8217;d that lady,</LINE>
<LINE>And might not be delivered to the world</LINE>
<LINE>Till I had made mine own occasion mellow</LINE>
<LINE>What my estate is!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">That were hard to compass,</LINE>
<LINE>Because she will admit no kind of suit,</LINE>
<LINE>No, not the Duke&#8217;s.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VIO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There is a fair behavior in thee, captain,</LINE>
<LINE>And though that nature with a beauteous wall</LINE>
<LINE>Doth oft close in pollution, yet of thee</LINE>
<LINE>I will believe thou hast a mind that suits</LINE>
<LINE>With this thy fair and outward character.</LINE>
<LINE>I prithee (and I&#8217;ll pay thee bounteously)</LINE>
<LINE>Conceal me what I am, and be my aid</LINE>
<LINE>For such disguise as haply shall become</LINE>
<LINE>The form of my intent. I&#8217;ll serve this duke;</LINE>
<LINE>Thou shalt present me as an eunuch to him,</LINE>
<LINE>It may be worth thy pains; for I can sing</LINE>
<LINE>And speak to him in many sorts of music</LINE>
<LINE>That will allow me very worth his service.</LINE>
<LINE>What else may hap, to time I will commit,</LINE>
<LINE>Only shape thou thy silence to my wit.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Be you his eunuch, and your mute I&#8217;ll be;</LINE>
<LINE>When my tongue blabs, then let mine eyes not see.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VIO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I thank thee. Lead me on.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Sir Toby Belch and Maria.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR TO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What a plague means my niece to take the death of her brother thus? I am sure care&#8217;s an enemy to life.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By my troth, Sir Toby, you must come in earlier a&#8217; nights. Your cousin, my lady, takes great exceptions to your ill hours.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR TO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, let her except before excepted.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, but you must confine yourself within the modest limits of order.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR TO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Confine? I&#8217;ll confine myself no finer than I am. These clothes are good enough to drink in, and so be these boots too; and they be not, let them hang themselves in their own straps.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That quaffing and drinking will undo you. I heard my lady talk of it yesterday; and of a foolish knight that you brought in one night here to be her wooer.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR TO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who, Sir Andrew Aguecheek?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, he.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR TO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He&#8217;s as tall a man as any&#8217;s in Illyria.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What&#8217;s that to th&#8217; purpose?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR TO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, he has three thousand ducats a year.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, but he&#8217;ll have but a year in all these ducats. He&#8217;s a very fool and a prodigal.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR TO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fie, that You&#8217;ll say so! He plays o&#8217; th&#8217; viol-de-gamboys, and speaks three or four languages word for word without book, and hath all the good gifts of nature.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He hath indeed, almost natural; for besides that he&#8217;s a fool, he&#8217;s a great quarreller; and but that he hath the gift of a coward to allay the gust he hath in quarrelling, &#8217;tis thought among the prudent he would quickly have the gift of a grave.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR TO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By this hand, they are scoundrels and sub-stractors that say so of him. Who are they?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>They that add moreov&#8217;r, he&#8217;s drunk nightly in your company.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR TO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>With drinking healths to my niece. I&#8217;ll drink to her as long as there is a passage in my throat, and drink in Illyria. He&#8217;s a coward and a coystrill that will not drink to my niece till his brains turn o&#8217; th&#8217; toe like a parish-top. What, wench! Castiliano vulgo! For here comes Sir Andrew Agueface.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Sir Andrew Aguecheek.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR AND.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir Toby Belch! How now, Sir Toby Belch?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR TO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sweet Sir Andrew!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR AND.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Bless you, fair shrew.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And you too, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR TO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Accost, Sir Andrew, accost.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR AND.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What&#8217;s that?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR TO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My niece&#8217;s chambermaid.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR AND.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good Mistress Accost, I desire better acquaintance.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My name is Mary, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR AND.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good Mistress Mary Accost&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR TO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You mistake, knight. &#8220;Accost&#8221; is front her, board her, woo her, assail her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR AND.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By my troth, I would not undertake her in this company. Is that the meaning of &#8220;accost&#8221;?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fare you well, gentlemen.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR TO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And thou let part so, Sir Andrew, would thou mightst never draw sword again.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR AND.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And you part so, mistress, I would I might never draw sword again. Fair lady, do you think you have fools in hand?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, I have not you by th&#8217; hand.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR AND.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, but you shall have&#8212;and here&#8217;s my hand.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, sir, thought is free. I pray you bring your hand to th&#8217; butt&#8217;ry-bar, and let it drink.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR AND.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Wherefore, sweetheart? What&#8217;s your metaphor?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It&#8217;s dry, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR AND.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, I think so. I am not such an ass but I can keep my hand dry. But what&#8217;s your jest?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A dry jest, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR AND.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Are you full of them?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, sir, I have them at my fingers&#8217; ends. Marry, now I let go your hand, I am barren.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit Maria.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR TO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O knight, thou lack&#8217;st a cup of canary. When did I see thee so put down?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR AND.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Never in your life I think, unless you see canary put me down. Methinks sometimes I have no more wit than a Christian or an ordinary man has; but I am a great eater of beef, and I believe that does harm to my wit.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR TO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No question.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR AND.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And I thought that, I&#8217;d forswear it. I&#8217;ll ride home tomorrow, Sir Toby.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR TO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pourquoi, my dear knight?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR AND.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What is &#8220;pourquoi&#8221;? Do, or not do? I would I had bestow&#8217;d that time in the tongues that I have in fencing, dancing, and bear-baiting. O had I but follow&#8217;d the arts!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR TO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then hadst thou had an excellent head of hair.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR AND.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, would that have mended my hair?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR TO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Past question, for thou seest it will not curl by nature.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR AND.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But it becomes me well enough, does&#8217;t not?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR TO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Excellent, it hangs like flax on a distaff; and I hope to see a huswife take thee between her legs, and spin it off.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR AND.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Faith, I&#8217;ll home tomorrow, Sir Toby. Your niece will not be seen, or if she be, it&#8217;s four to one she&#8217;ll none of me. The Count himself here hard by woos her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR TO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She&#8217;ll none o&#8217; th&#8217; Count. She&#8217;ll not match above her degree, neither in estate, years, nor wit; I have heard her swear&#8217;t. Tut, there&#8217;s life in&#8217;t, man.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR AND.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll stay a month longer. I am a fellow o&#8217; th&#8217; strangest mind i&#8217; th&#8217; world; I delight in masques and revels sometimes altogether.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR TO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Art thou good at these kickshawses, knight?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR AND.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As any man in Illyria, whatsoever he be, under the degree of my betters, and yet I will not compare with an old man.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR TO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What is thy excellence in a galliard, knight?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR AND.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Faith, I can cut a caper.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR TO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And I can cut the mutton to&#8217;t.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR AND.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And I think I have the back-trick simply as strong as any man in Illyria.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR TO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Wherefore are these things hid? Wherefore have these gifts a curtain before &#8217;em? Are they like to take dust, like Mistress Mall&#8217;s picture? Why dost thou not go to church in a galliard, and come home in a coranto? My very walk should be a jig.</LINE>
<LINE>I would not so much as make water but in a sink-a-pace. What dost thou mean? Is it a world to hide virtues in? I did think by the excellent constitution of thy leg, it was form&#8217;d under the star of a galliard.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR AND.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, &#8217;tis strong; and it does indifferent well in a dun-color&#8217;d stock. Shall we set about some revels?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR TO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What shall we do else? Were we not born under Taurus?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR AND.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Taurus? That&#8217;s sides and heart.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR TO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, sir, it is legs and thighs. Let me see thee caper. Ha, higher! Ha, ha, excellent!</LINE>

<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, either tell me where thou hast been, or I will not open my lips so wide as a bristle may enter, in way of thy excuse. My lady will hang thee for thy absence.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let her hang me! He that is well hang&#8217;d in this world needs to fear no colors.</LINE>

<LINE>A good lenten answer. I can tell thee where that saying was born, of &#8220;I fear no colors.&#8221;</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Where, good Mistress Mary?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In the wars, and that may you be bold to say in your foolery.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, God give them wisdom that have it; and those that are fools, let them use their talents.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yet you will be hang&#8217;d for being so long absent, or to be turn&#8217;d away&#8212;is not that as good as a hanging to you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Many a good hanging prevents a bad marriage; and for turning away, let summer bear it out.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You are resolute then?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not so, neither, but I am resolv&#8217;d on two points&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That if one break, the other will hold; or if both break, your gaskins fall.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Apt, in good faith, very apt. Well, go thy way, if Sir Toby would leave drinking, thou wert as witty a piece of Eve&#8217;s flesh as any in Illyria.</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Peace, you rogue, no more o&#8217; that. Here comes my lady. Make your excuse wisely, you were best.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit.</STAGEDIR>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Lady Olivia with Malvolio and Attendants.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Wit, and&#8217;t be thy will, put me into good fooling! Those wits that think they have thee do very oft prove fools; and I that am sure I lack thee, may pass for a wise man. For what says Quinapalus? &#8220;Better a witty fool than a foolish wit.&#8221;&#8212;God bless thee, lady!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLI.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Take the fool away.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do you not hear, fellows? Take away the lady.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLI.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go to, y&#8217; are a dry fool; I&#8217;ll no more of you. Besides, you grow dishonest.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Two faults, madonna, that drink and good counsel will amend; for give the dry fool drink, then is the fool not dry; bid the dishonest man mend himself: if he mend, he is no longer dishonest; if he cannot, let the botcher mend him. Any thing that&#8217;s mended is but patch&#8217;d; virtue that transgresses is but patch&#8217;d with sin, and sin that amends is but patch&#8217;d with virtue. If that this simple syllogism will serve, so; if it will not, what remedy? As there is no true cuckold but calamity, so beauty&#8217;s a flower. The lady bade take away the fool, therefore I say again, take her away.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLI.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, I bade them take away you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Misprision in the highest degree! Lady, &#8220;Cucullus non facit monachum&#8221;: that&#8217;s as much to say as I wear not motley in my brain. Good madonna, give me leave to prove you a fool.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLI.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Can you do it?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLO.</SPEAKER>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLI.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Make your proof.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I must catechize you for it, madonna. Good my mouse of virtue, answer me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLI.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, sir, for want of other idleness, I&#8217;ll bide your proof.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good madonna, why mourn&#8217;st thou?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLI.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good fool, for my brother&#8217;s death.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I think his soul is in hell, madonna.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLI.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know his soul is in heaven, fool.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The more fool, madonna, to mourn for your brother&#8217;s soul, being in heaven. Take away the fool, gentlemen.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLI.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What think you of this fool, Malvolio? Doth he not mend?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, and shall do till the pangs of death shake him. Infirmity, that decays the wise, doth ever make the better fool.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>God send you, sir, a speedy infirmity, for the better increasing your folly! Sir Toby will be sworn that I am no fox, but he will not pass his word for twopence that you are no fool.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLI.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How say you to that, Malvolio?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I marvel your ladyship takes delight in such a barren rascal. I saw him put down the other day with an ordinary fool that has no more brain than a stone. Look you now, he&#8217;s out of his guard already. Unless you laugh and minister occasion to him, he is gagg&#8217;d. I protest I take these wise men that crow so at these set kind of fools no better than the fools&#8217; zanies.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLI.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, you are sick of self-love, Malvolio, and taste with a distemper&#8217;d appetite. To be generous, guiltless, and of free disposition, is to take those things for bird-bolts that you deem cannon-bullets. There is no slander in an allow&#8217;d fool, though he do nothing but rail; nor no railing in a known discreet man, though he do nothing but reprove.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now Mercury indue thee with leasing, for thou speak&#8217;st well of fools!</LINE>

<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Madam, there is at the gate a young gentleman much desires to speak with you.</LINE>

<LINE>From the Count Orsino, is it?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know not, madam. &#8217;Tis a fair young man, and well attended.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>Sir Toby, madam, your kinsman.</LINE>

<LINE>Fetch him off, I pray you, he speaks nothing but madman; fie on him!</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit Maria.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Go you, Malvolio; if it be a suit from the Count, I am sick, or not at home&#8212;what you will, to dismiss it.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit Malvolio.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Now you see, sir, how your fooling grows old, and people dislike it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou hast spoke for us, madonna, as if thy eldest son should be a fool; whose skull Jove cram with brains! For&#8212;here he comes&#8212;</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Sir Toby.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>One of thy kin has a most weak pia mater.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLI.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By mine honor, half drunk. What is he at the gate, cousin?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Good Sir Toby!</LINE>

<LINE>Cousin, cousin, how have you come so early by this lethargy?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR TO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Lechery! I defy lechery. There&#8217;s one at the gate.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLI.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, marry, what is he?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR TO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let him be the devil and he will, I care not; give me faith say I. Well, it&#8217;s all one.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLI.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What&#8217;s a drunken man like, fool?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Like a drown&#8217;d man, a fool, and a madman. One draught above heat makes him a fool, the second mads him, and a third drowns him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLI.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go thou and seek the crowner, and let him sit o&#8217; my coz; for he&#8217;s in the third degree of drink, he&#8217;s drown&#8217;d. Go look after him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>He is but mad yet, madonna, and the fool shall look to the madman.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exit.</STAGEDIR>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Malvolio.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Madam, yond young fellow swears he will speak with you. I told him you were sick; he takes on him to understand so much, and therefore comes to speak with you. I told him you were asleep; he seems to have a foreknowledge of that too, and therefore comes to speak with you. What is to be said to him, lady? He&#8217;s fortified against any denial.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLI.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tell him he shall not speak with me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>H&#8217;as been told so; and he says he&#8217;ll stand at your door like a sheriff&#8217;s post, and be the supporter to a bench, but he&#8217;ll speak with you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLI.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What kind o&#8217; man is he?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, of mankind.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLI.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What manner of man?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Of very ill manner: he&#8217;ll speak with you, will you or no.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLI.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Of what personage and years is he?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not yet old enough for a man, nor young enough for a boy; as a squash is before &#8217;tis a peas-cod, or a codling when &#8217;tis almost an apple. &#8217;Tis with him in standing water, between boy and man. He is very well-favor&#8217;d, and he speaks very shrewishly. One would think his mother&#8217;s milk were scarce out of him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLI.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let him approach. Call in my gentlewoman.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEAKER>VIO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The honorable lady of the house, which is she?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLI.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Speak to me, I shall answer for her. Your will?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VIO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Most radiant, exquisite, and unmatchable beauty&#8212;I pray you tell me if this be the lady of the house, for I never saw her. I would be loath to cast away my speech; for besides that it is excellently well penn&#8217;d, I have taken great pains to con it. Good beauties, let me sustain no scorn; I am very comptible, even to the least sinister usage.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLI.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Whence came you, sir?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VIO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I can say little more than I have studied, and that question&#8217;s out of my part. Good gentle one, give me modest assurance if you be the lady of the house, that I may proceed in my speech.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLI.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Are you a comedian?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VIO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, my profound heart; and yet (by the very fangs of malice I swear) I am not that I play. Are you the lady of the house?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLI.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If I do not usurp myself, I am.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VIO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Most certain, if you are she, you do usurp yourself; for what is yours to bestow is not yours to reserve. But this is from my commission; I will on with my speech in your praise, and then show you the heart of my message.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLI.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come to what is important in&#8217;t. I forgive you the praise.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VIO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alas, I took great pains to study it, and &#8217;tis poetical.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLI.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is the more like to be feign&#8217;d, I pray you keep it in. I heard you were saucy at my gates, and allow&#8217;d your approach rather to wonder at you than to hear you. If you be not mad, be gone. If you have reason, be brief. &#8217;Tis not that time of moon with me to make one in so skipping a dialogue.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Will you hoist sail, sir? Here lies your way.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VIO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, good swabber, I am to hull here a little longer. Some mollification for your giant, sweet lady. Tell me your mind&#8212;I am a messenger.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLI.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sure you have some hideous matter to deliver, when the courtesy of it is so fearful. Speak your office.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VIO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It alone concerns your ear. I bring no overture of war, no taxation of homage; I hold the olive in my hand; my words are as full of peace as matter.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLI.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yet you began rudely. What are you? What would you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VIO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The rudeness that hath appear&#8217;d in me have I learn&#8217;d from my entertainment. What I am, and what I would, are as secret as maidenhead: to your ears, divinity; to any other&#8217;s, profanation.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Give us the place alone, we will hear this divinity.</LINE>

<LINE>In his bosom? In what chapter of his bosom?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VIO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To answer by the method, in the first of his heart.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Good madam, let me see your face.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLI.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Have you any commission from your lord to negotiate with my face? You are now out of your text; but we will draw the curtain, and show you the picture. Look you, sir, such a one I was this present.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Unveiling.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Is&#8217;t not well done?</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLI.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, sir, I will not be so hard-hearted; I will give out divers schedules of my beauty. It shall be inventoried, and every particle and utensil labell&#8217;d to my will: as, item, two lips, indifferent red; item, two grey eyes, with lids to them; item, one neck, one chin, and so forth. Were you sent hither to praise me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VIO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I see you what you are, you are too proud;</LINE>
<LINE>But if you were the devil, you are fair.</LINE>

<LINE>In voices well divulg&#8217;d, free, learn&#8217;d, and valiant,</LINE>
<LINE>And in dimension, and the shape of nature,</LINE>
<LINE>A gracious person. But yet I cannot love him.</LINE>
<LINE>He might have took his answer long ago.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VIO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If I did love you in my master&#8217;s flame,</LINE>

<SPEAKER>SEB.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By your patience, no. My stars shine darkly over me. The malignancy of my fate might perhaps distemper yours; therefore I shall crave of you your leave, that I may bear my evils alone. It were a bad recompense for your love, to lay any of them on you.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let me yet know of you whither you are bound.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SEB.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, sooth, sir; my determinate voyage is mere extravagancy. But I perceive in you so excellent a touch of modesty, that you will not extort from me what I am willing to keep in; therefore it charges me in manners the rather to express myself. You must know of me then, Antonio, my name is Sebastian, which I call&#8217;d Rodorigo; my father was that Sebastian of Messaline, whom I know you have heard of. He left behind him myself and a sister, both born in an hour. If the heavens had been pleas&#8217;d, would we had so ended! But you, sir, alter&#8217;d that, for some hour before you took me from the breach of the sea was my sister drown&#8217;d.</LINE>

<LINE>A lady, sir, though it was said she much resembled me, was yet of many accounted beautiful; but though I could not with such estimable wonder overfar believe that, yet thus far I will boldly publish her: she bore a mind that envy could not but call fair. She is drown&#8217;d already, sir, with salt water, though I seem to drown her remembrance again with more.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Duke, Viola, Curio, and others.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Give me some music. Now good morrow, friends.</LINE>
<LINE>Now, good Cesario, but that piece of song,</LINE>
<LINE>That old and antique song we heard last night;</LINE>
<LINE>Methought it did relieve my passion much,</LINE>
<LINE>More than light airs and recollected terms</LINE>
<LINE>Of these most brisk and giddy-paced times.</LINE>
<LINE>Come, but one verse.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CUR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He is not here, so please your lordship, that should sing it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who was it?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CUR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Feste the jester, my lord, a fool that the Lady Olivia&#8217;s father took much delight in. He is about the house.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Seek him out, and play the tune the while.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exit Curio. Music plays.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Come hither, boy. If ever thou shalt love,</LINE>
<LINE>In the sweet pangs of it remember me;</LINE>
<LINE>For such as I am, all true lovers are,</LINE>
<LINE>Unstaid and skittish in all motions else,</LINE>
<LINE>Save in the constant image of the creature</LINE>
<LINE>That is belov&#8217;d. How dost thou like this tune?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VIO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It gives a very echo to the seat</LINE>
<LINE>Where Love is thron&#8217;d.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Thou dost speak masterly.</LINE>
<LINE>My life upon&#8217;t, young though thou art, thine eye</LINE>
<LINE>Hath stay&#8217;d upon some favor that it loves.</LINE>
<LINE>Hath it not, boy?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VIO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="3">A little, by your favor.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What kind of woman is&#8217;t?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VIO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Of your complexion.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She is not worth thee then. What years, i&#8217; faith?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VIO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>About your years, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Too old, by heaven. Let still the woman take</LINE>
<LINE>An elder than herself, so wears she to him;</LINE>
<LINE>So sways she level in her husband&#8217;s heart.</LINE>
<LINE>For, boy, however we do praise ourselves,</LINE>
<LINE>Our fancies are more giddy and unfirm,</LINE>
<LINE>More longing, wavering, sooner lost and worn,</LINE>
<LINE>Than women&#8217;s are.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VIO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">I think it well, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then let thy love be younger than thyself,</LINE>
<LINE>Or thy affection cannot hold the bent;</LINE>
<LINE>For women are as roses, whose fair flow&#8217;r</LINE>
<LINE>Being once display&#8217;d, doth fall that very hour.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VIO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And so they are; alas, that they are so!</LINE>
<LINE>To die, even when they to perfection grow!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Curio and Clown.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O fellow, come, the song we had last night.</LINE>
<LINE>Mark it, Cesario, it is old and plain.</LINE>
<LINE>The spinsters and the knitters in the sun,</LINE>
<LINE>And the free maids that weave their thread with bones,</LINE>
<LINE>Do use to chaunt it. It is silly sooth,</LINE>
<LINE>And dallies with the innocence of love,</LINE>
<LINE>Like the old age.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Are you ready, sir?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, prithee sing.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE type="lyric">Come away, come away, death,</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">And in sad cypress let me be laid.</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">Fly away, fly away, breath,</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">I am slain by a fair cruel maid.</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">My shroud of white, stuck all with yew,</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">O, prepare it!</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">My part of death, no one so true</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">Did share it.</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">Not a flower, not a flower sweet</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">On my black coffin let there be strown.</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">Not a friend, not a friend greet</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">My poor corpse, where my bones shall be thrown.</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">A thousand thousand sighs to save,</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">Lay me, O, where</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">Sad true lover never find my grave,</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">To weep there.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There&#8217;s for thy pains.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No pains, sir, I take pleasure in singing, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll pay thy pleasure then.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Truly, sir, and pleasure will be paid, one time or another.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Give me now leave to leave thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now the melancholy god protect thee, and the tailor make thy doublet of changeable taffata, for thy mind is a very opal. I would have men of such constancy put to sea, that their business might be every thing and their intent every where, for that&#8217;s it that always makes a good voyage of nothing. Farewell.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let all the rest give place.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Curio and Attendants retire.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Once more, Cesario,</LINE>
<LINE>Get thee to yond same sovereign cruelty,</LINE>
<LINE>Tell her, my love, more noble than the world,</LINE>
<LINE>Prizes not quantity of dirty lands;</LINE>
<LINE>The parts that fortune hath bestow&#8217;d upon her,</LINE>
<LINE>Tell her, I hold as giddily as fortune;</LINE>
<LINE>But &#8217;tis that miracle and queen of gems</LINE>
<LINE>That nature pranks her in attracts my soul.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VIO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But if she cannot love you, sir?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I cannot be so answer&#8217;d.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VIO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Sooth, but you must.</LINE>
<LINE>Say that some lady, as perhaps there is,</LINE>
<LINE>Hath for your love as great a pang of heart</LINE>
<LINE>As you have for Olivia. You cannot love her;</LINE>
<LINE>You tell her so. Must she not then be answer&#8217;d?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There is no woman&#8217;s sides</LINE>
<LINE>Can bide the beating of so strong a passion</LINE>
<LINE>As love doth give my heart; no woman&#8217;s heart</LINE>
<LINE>So big, to hold so much; they lack retention.</LINE>
<LINE>Alas, their love may be call&#8217;d appetite,</LINE>
<LINE>No motion of the liver, but the palate,</LINE>
<LINE>That suffer surfeit, cloyment, and revolt,</LINE>
<LINE>But mine is all as hungry as the sea,</LINE>
<LINE>And can digest as much. Make no compare</LINE>
<LINE>Between that love a woman can bear me</LINE>
<LINE>And that I owe Olivia.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VIO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Ay, but I know&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What dost thou know?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VIO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Too well what love women to men may owe;</LINE>
<LINE>In faith, they are as true of heart as we.</LINE>
<LINE>My father had a daughter lov&#8217;d a man</LINE>
<LINE>As it might be perhaps, were I a woman,</LINE>
<LINE>I should your lordship.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">And what&#8217;s her history?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VIO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A blank, my lord; she never told her love,</LINE>
<LINE>But let concealment like a worm i&#8217; th&#8217; bud</LINE>
<LINE>Feed on her damask cheek; she pin&#8217;d in thought,</LINE>
<LINE>And with a green and yellow melancholy</LINE>
<LINE>She sate like Patience on a monument,</LINE>
<LINE>Smiling at grief. Was not this love indeed?</LINE>
<LINE>We men may say more, swear more, but indeed</LINE>
<LINE>Our shows are more than will; for still we prove</LINE>
<LINE>Much in our vows, but little in our love.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But died thy sister of her love, my boy?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VIO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am all the daughters of my father&#8217;s house,</LINE>
<LINE>And all the brothers too&#8212;and yet I know not.</LINE>
<LINE>Sir, shall I to this lady?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Ay, that&#8217;s the theme,</LINE>

<LINE>Wouldst thou not be glad to have the niggardly rascally sheep-biter come by some notable shame?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FAB.</SPEAKER>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR TO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To anger him we&#8217;ll have the bear again, and we will fool him black and blue, shall we not, Sir Andrew?</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Get ye all three into the box-tree; Malvolio&#8217;s coming down this walk. He has been yonder i&#8217; the sun practicing behavior to his own shadow this half hour. Observe him, for the love of mockery; for I know this letter will make a contemplative idiot of him. Close, in the name of jesting!</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>The men hide themselves.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis but fortune, all is fortune. Maria once told me she did affect me, and I have heard herself come thus near, that should she fancy, it should be one of my complexion. Besides, she uses me with a more exalted respect than any one else that follows her. What should I think on&#8217;t?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR TO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here&#8217;s an overweening rogue!</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Reads.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>&#8220;If this fall into thy hand, revolve. In my stars I am above thee, but be not afraid of greatness. Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon &#8217;em. Thy Fates open their hands, let thy blood and spirit embrace them, and to inure thyself to what thou art like to be, cast thy humble slough and appear fresh. Be opposite with a kinsman, surly with servants; let thy tongue tang arguments of state; put thyself into the trick of singularity. She thus advises thee that sighs for thee. Remember who commended thy yellow stockings, and wish&#8217;d to see thee ever cross-garter&#8217;d: I say, remember. Go to, thou art made if thou desir&#8217;st to be so; if not, let me see thee a steward still, the fellow of servants, and not worthy to touch Fortune&#8217;s fingers. Farewell. She that would alter services with thee,</LINE>
<LINE>The Fortunate-Unhappy.&#8221;</LINE>
<LINE>Daylight and champian discovers not more. This is open. I will be proud, I will read politic authors, I will baffle Sir Toby, I will wash off gross acquaintance, I will be point-devise the very man. I do not now fool myself, to let imagination jade me; for every reason excites to this, that my lady loves me. She did commend my yellow stockings of late, she did praise my leg being cross-garter&#8217;d, and in this she manifests herself to my love, and with a kind of injunction drives me to these habits of her liking. I thank my stars, I am happy. I will be strange, stout, in yellow stockings, and cross-garter&#8217;d, even with the swiftness of putting on. Jove and my stars be prais&#8217;d! Here is yet a postscript.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Reads.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>&#8220;Thou canst not choose but know who I am. If thou entertain&#8217;st my love, let it appear in thy smiling; thy smiles become thee well. Therefore in my presence still smile, dear my sweet, I prithee.&#8221;</LINE>
<LINE>Jove, I thank thee. I will smile, I will do every thing that thou wilt have me.</LINE>

<LINE>If you will then see the fruits of the sport, mark his first approach before my lady. He will come to her in yellow stockings, and &#8217;tis a color she abhors, and cross-garter&#8217;d, a fashion she detests; and he will smile upon her, which will now be so unsuitable to her disposition, being addicted to a melancholy as she is, that it cannot but turn him into a notable contempt.

<SPEAKER>VIO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;Save thee, friend, and thy music! Dost thou live by thy tabor?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, sir, I live by the church.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VIO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Art thou a churchman?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No such matter, sir. I do live by the church; for I do live at my house, and my house doth stand by the church.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VIO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So thou mayst say the king lies by a beggar, if a beggar dwells near him; or the church stands by thy tabor, if thy tabor stand by the church.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You have said, sir. To see this age! A sentence is but a chev&#8217;ril glove to a good wit. How quickly the wrong side may be turn&#8217;d outward!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VIO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, that&#8217;s certain. They that dally nicely with words may quickly make them wanton.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would therefore my sister had had no name, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VIO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, man?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, sir, her name&#8217;s a word, and to dally with that word might make my sister wanton. But indeed, words are very rascals since bonds disgrac&#8217;d them.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VIO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thy reason, man?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Troth, sir, I can yield you none without words, and words are grown so false, I am loath to prove reason with them.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VIO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I warrant thou art a merry fellow, and car&#8217;st for nothing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not so, sir, I do care for something; but in my conscience, sir, I do not care for you. If that be to care for nothing, sir, I would it would make you invisible.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VIO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Art not thou the Lady Olivia&#8217;s fool?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, indeed, sir, the Lady Olivia has no folly. She will keep no fool, sir, till she be married, and fools are as like husbands as pilchers are to herrings, the husband&#8217;s the bigger. I am indeed not her fool, but her corrupter of words.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VIO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I saw thee late at the Count Orsino&#8217;s.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Foolery, sir, does walk about the orb like the sun, it shines every where. I would be sorry, sir, but the fool should be as oft with your master as with my mistress. I think I saw your wisdom there.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VIO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, and thou pass upon me, I&#8217;ll no more with thee. Hold, there&#8217;s expenses for thee.</LINE>

<LINE>By my troth, I&#8217;ll tell thee, I am almost sick for one&#8212;</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Would not a pair of these have bred, sir?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VIO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, being kept together, and put to use.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would play Lord Pandarus of Phrygia, sir, to bring a Cressida to this Troilus.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>VIO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I understand you, sir. &#8217;Tis well begg&#8217;d.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The matter, I hope, is not great, sir&#8212;begging but a beggar: Cressida was a beggar. My lady is within, sir. I will conster to them whence you come; who you are, and what you would, are out of my welkin&#8212;I might say &#8220;element,&#8221; but the word is overworn.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VIO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This fellow is wise enough to play the fool,</LINE>
<LINE>And to do that well craves a kind of wit.</LINE>
<LINE>He must observe their mood on whom he jests,</LINE>
<LINE>The quality of persons, and the time;</LINE>
<LINE>And like the haggard, check at every feather</LINE>
<LINE>That comes before his eye. This is a practice</LINE>
<LINE>As full of labor as a wise man&#8217;s art;</LINE>
<LINE>For folly that he wisely shows is fit,</LINE>
<LINE>But wise men, folly-fall&#8217;n, quite taint their wit.</LINE>

<LINE>Madam, I come to whet your gentle thoughts</LINE>

<LINE offset="3">O, by your leave, I pray you:</LINE>
<LINE>I bade you never speak again of him;</LINE>
<LINE>But would you undertake another suit,</LINE>

<SPEAKER>VIO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">Dear lady&#8212;</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLI.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Give me leave, beseech you. I did send,</LINE>
<LINE>After the last enchantment you did here,</LINE>
<LINE>A ring in chase of you; so did I abuse</LINE>
<LINE>Myself, my servant, and I fear me you.</LINE>
<LINE>Under your hard construction must I sit,</LINE>
<LINE>To force that on you in a shameful cunning</LINE>
<LINE>Which you knew none of yours. What might you think?</LINE>
<LINE>Have you not set mine honor at the stake,</LINE>
<LINE>And baited it with all th&#8217; unmuzzled thoughts</LINE>
<LINE>That tyrannous heart can think? To one of your receiving</LINE>
<LINE>Enough is shown; a cypress, not a bosom,</LINE>
<LINE>Hides my heart. So let me hear you speak.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VIO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I pity you.</LINE>

<LINE>No, not a grize; for &#8217;tis a vulgar proof</LINE>
<LINE>That very oft we pity enemies.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Cesario, by the roses of the spring,</LINE>
<LINE>By maidhood, honor, truth, and every thing,</LINE>
<LINE>I love thee so, that maugre all thy pride,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor wit nor reason can my passion hide.</LINE>
<LINE>Do not extort thy reasons from this clause,</LINE>
<LINE>For that I woo, thou therefore hast no cause;</LINE>
<LINE>But rather reason thus with reason fetter:</LINE>
<LINE>Love sought is good, but given unsought is better.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VIO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By innocence I swear, and by my youth,</LINE>
<LINE>I have one heart, one bosom, and one truth,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR TO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And they have been grand-jurymen since before Noah was a sailor.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FAB.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She did show favor to the youth in your sight only to exasperate you, to awake your dormouse valor, to put fire in your heart, and brimstone in your liver. You should then have accosted her, and with some excellent jests, fire-new from the mint, you should have bang&#8217;d the youth into dumbness. This was look&#8217;d for at your hand, and this was balk&#8217;d. The double gilt of this opportunity you let time wash off, and you are now sail&#8217;d into the north of my lady&#8217;s opinion, where you will hang like an icicle on a Dutchman&#8217;s beard, unless you do redeem it by some laudable attempt either of valor or policy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR AND.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And&#8217;t be any way, it must be with valor, for policy I hate. I had as lief be a Brownist as a politician.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR TO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why then build me thy fortunes upon the basis of valor. Challenge me the Count&#8217;s youth to fight with him, hurt him in eleven places&#8212;my niece shall take note of it, and assure thyself, there is no love-broker in the world can more prevail in man&#8217;s commendation with woman than report of valor.</LINE>

<LINE>Will either of you bear me a challenge to him?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR TO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go, write it in a martial hand, be curst and brief. It is no matter how witty, so it be eloquent and full of invention. Taunt him with the license of ink. If thou thou&#8217;st him some thrice, it shall not be amiss; and as many lies as will lie in thy sheet of paper, although the sheet were big enough for the bed of Ware in England, set &#8217;em down. Go about it. Let there be gall enough in thy ink, though thou write with a goose-pen, no matter. About it.</LINE>

<LINE>Never trust me then; and by all means stir on the youth to an answer. I think oxen and wain-ropes cannot hale them together. For Andrew, if he were open&#8217;d and you find so much blood in his liver as will clog the foot of a flea, I&#8217;ll eat the rest of th&#8217; anatomy.</LINE>

He does smile his face into more lines than is in the new map, with the augmentation of the Indies; you have not seen such a thing as &#8217;tis. I can hardly forbear hurling things at him.

<LINE>I do not without danger walk these streets.</LINE>
<LINE>Once in a sea-fight &#8217;gainst the Count his galleys</LINE>

<LINE>Th&#8217; offense is not of such a bloody nature,</LINE>

<LINE>It might have since been answer&#8217;d in repaying</LINE>

<LINE>Good Maria, let this fellow be look&#8217;d to. Where&#8217;s my cousin Toby? Let some of my people have a special care of him. I would not have him miscarry for the half of my dowry.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit with Maria.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O ho, do you come near me now? No worse man than Sir Toby to look to me! This concurs directly with the letter: she sends him on purpose, that I may appear stubborn to him; for she incites me to that in the letter. &#8220;Cast thy humble slough,&#8221; says she; &#8220;be opposite with a kinsman, surly with servants; let thy tongue tang with arguments of state; put thyself into the trick of singularity&#8221;; and consequently sets down the manner how: as a sad face, a reverend carriage, a slow tongue, in the habit of some sir of note, and so forth. I have lim&#8217;d her, but it is Jove&#8217;s doing, and Jove make me thankful! And when she went away now, &#8220;Let this fellow be look&#8217;d to&#8221;; &#8220;fellow&#8221;! Not &#8220;Malvolio,&#8221; nor after my degree, but &#8220;fellow.&#8221; Why, every thing adheres together, that no dram of a scruple, no scruple of a scruple, no obstacle, no incredulous or unsafe circumstance&#8212;What can be said? Nothing that can be can come between me and the full prospect of my hopes. Well, Jove, not I, is the doer of this, and he is to be thank&#8217;d.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Toby, Fabian, and Maria.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR TO.</SPEAKER>

<LINE>The house will be the quieter.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR TO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, we&#8217;ll have him in a dark room and bound. My niece is already in the belief that he&#8217;s mad. We may carry it thus, for our pleasure and his penance, till our very pastime, tir&#8217;d out of breath, prompt us to have mercy on him; at which time we will bring the device to the bar and crown thee for a finder of madmen. But see, but see.</LINE>

<LINE>&#8220;Thou com&#8217;st to the Lady Olivia, and in my sight she uses thee kindly. But thou liest in thy throat, that is not the matter I challenge thee for.&#8221;</LINE>

<LINE>You may have very fit occasion for&#8217;t; he is now in some commerce with my lady, and will by and by depart.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR TO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go, Sir Andrew, scout me for him at the corner of the orchard like a burn-baily. So soon as ever thou seest him, draw, and as thou draw&#8217;st, swear horrible; for it comes to pass oft that a terrible oath, with a swaggering accent sharply twang&#8217;d off, gives manhood more approbation than ever proof itself would have earn&#8217;d him. Away!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR AND.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, let me alone for swearing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR TO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now will not I deliver his letter; for the behavior of the young gentleman gives him out to be of good capacity and breeding; his employment between his lord and my niece confirms no less. Therefore this letter, being so excellently ignorant, will breed no terror in the youth; he will find it comes from a clodpole. But, sir, I will deliver his challenge by word of mouth, set upon Aguecheek a notable report of valor, and drive the gentleman (as I know his youth will aptly receive it) into a most hideous opinion of his rage, skill, fury, and impetuosity. This will so fright them both that they will kill one another by the look, like cockatrices.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Olivia and Viola.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FAB.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here he comes with your niece. Give them way till he take leave, and presently after him.</LINE>

<LINE>And you, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR TO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That defense thou hast, betake thee to&#8217;t. Of what nature the wrongs are thou hast done him, I know not; but thy intercepter, full of despite, bloody as the hunter, attends thee at the orchard-end. Dismount thy tuck, be yare in thy preparation, for thy assailant is quick, skillful, and deadly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VIO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You mistake, sir, I am sure; no man hath any quarrel to me. My remembrance is very free and clear from any image of offense done to any man.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR TO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You&#8217;ll find it otherwise, I assure you; therefore, if you hold your life at any price, betake you to your guard; for your opposite hath in him what youth, strength, skill, and wrath can furnish man withal.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VIO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I pray you, sir, what is he?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR TO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He is knight, dubb&#8217;d with unhatch&#8217;d rapier, and on carpet consideration, but he is a devil in private brawl. Souls and bodies hath he divorc&#8217;d three, and his incensement at this moment is so implacable, that satisfaction can be none but by pangs of death and sepulchre. Hob, nob, is his word; give&#8217;t or take&#8217;t.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VIO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will return again into the house, and desire some conduct of the lady. I am no fighter. I have heard of some kind of men that put quarrels purposely on others, to taste their valor. Belike this is a man of that quirk.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR TO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, no; his indignation derives itself out of a very competent injury; therefore get you on, and give him his desire. Back you shall not to the house, unless you undertake that with me which with as much safety you might answer him; therefore on, or strip your sword stark naked; for meddle you must, that&#8217;s certain, or forswear to wear iron about you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VIO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This is as uncivil as strange. I beseech you do me this courteous office, as to know of the knight what my offense to him is. It is something of my negligence, nothing of my purpose.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR TO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will do so. Signior Fabian, stay you by this gentleman till my return.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>I know the knight is incens&#8217;d against you, even to a mortal arbitrement, but nothing of the circumstance more.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VIO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I beseech you, what manner of man is he?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FAB.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nothing of that wonderful promise, to read him by his form, as you are like to find him in the proof of his valor. He is indeed, sir, the most skillful, bloody, and fatal opposite that you could possibly have found in any part of Illyria. Will you walk towards him? I will make your peace with him if I can.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VIO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I shall be much bound to you for&#8217;t. I am one that had rather go with sir priest than sir knight. I care not who knows so much of my mettle.</LINE>

<LINE>This is the air, that is the glorious sun,</LINE>
<LINE>This pearl she gave me, I do feel&#8217;t and see&#8217;t,</LINE>
<LINE>And though &#8217;tis wonder that enwraps me thus,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet &#8217;tis not madness. Where&#8217;s Antonio then?</LINE>
<LINE>I could not find him at the Elephant,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet there he was, and there I found this credit,</LINE>
<LINE>That he did range the town to seek me out.</LINE>
<LINE>His counsel now might do me golden service,</LINE>
<LINE>For though my soul disputes well with my sense,</LINE>
<LINE>That this may be some error, but no madness,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet doth this accident and flood of fortune</LINE>
<LINE>So far exceed all instance, all discourse,</LINE>
<LINE>That I am ready to distrust mine eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>And wrangle with my reason that persuades me</LINE>
<LINE>To any other trust but that I am mad,</LINE>
<LINE>Or else the lady&#8217;s mad; yet if &#8217;twere so,</LINE>
<LINE>She could not sway her house, command her followers,</LINE>
<LINE>Take and give back affairs, and their dispatch,</LINE>
<LINE>With such a smooth, discreet, and stable bearing</LINE>
<LINE>As I perceive she does. There&#8217;s something in&#8217;t</LINE>

<LINE>Ay, sir, we are some of her trappings.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know thee well; how dost thou, my good fellow?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Truly, sir, the better for my foes and the worse for my friends.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Just the contrary: the better for thy friends.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, sir, the worse.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How can that be?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, sir, they praise me, and make an ass of me. Now my foes tell me plainly I am an ass; so that by my foes, sir, I profit in the knowledge of myself, and by my friends I am abus&#8217;d; so that, conclusions to be as kisses, if your four negatives make your two affirmatives, why then the worse for my friends and the better for my foes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, this is excellent.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Thou shalt not be the worse for me, there&#8217;s gold.</LINE>

<LINE>O, you give me ill counsel.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Put your grace in your pocket, sir, for this once, and let your flesh and blood obey it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, I will be so much a sinner to be a double-dealer. There&#8217;s another.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Primo, secundo, tertio, is a good play, and the old saying is, the third pays for all. The triplex, sir, is a good tripping measure, or the bells of Saint Bennet, sir, may put you in mind&#8212;one, two, three.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You can fool no more money out of me at this throw. If you will let your lady know I am here to speak with her, and bring her along with you, it may awake my bounty further.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, sir, lullaby to your bounty till I come again. I go, sir, but I would not have you to think that my desire of having is the sin of covetousness; but as you say, sir, let your bounty take a nap, I will awake it anon.</LINE>

<LINE>Here comes the man, sir, that did rescue me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>That face of his I do remember well,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet when I saw it last, it was besmear&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>As black as Vulcan in the smoke of war.</LINE>
<LINE>A baubling vessel was he captain of,</LINE>
<LINE>For shallow draught and bulk unprizable,</LINE>
<LINE>With which such scathful grapple did he make</LINE>
<LINE>With the most noble bottom of our fleet,</LINE>
<LINE>That very envy, and the tongue of loss,</LINE>
<LINE>Cried fame and honor on him. What&#8217;s the matter?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. OFF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Orsino, this is that Antonio</LINE>
<LINE>That took the Phoenix and her fraught from Candy,</LINE>
<LINE>And this is he that did the Tiger board,</LINE>
<LINE>When your young nephew Titus lost his leg.</LINE>
<LINE>Here in the streets, desperate of shame and state,</LINE>
<LINE>In private brabble did we apprehend him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VIO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He did me kindness, sir, drew on my side,</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Notable pirate, thou salt-water thief!</LINE>

<LINE offset="5">Orsino, noble sir,</LINE>

<LINE>Antonio never yet was thief or pirate,</LINE>
<LINE>Though I confess, on base and ground enough,</LINE>
<LINE>Orsino&#8217;s enemy. A witchcraft drew me hither:</LINE>
<LINE>That most ingrateful boy there by your side</LINE>
<LINE>From the rude sea&#8217;s enrag&#8217;d and foamy mouth</LINE>
<LINE>Did I redeem; a wrack past hope he was.</LINE>
<LINE>His life I gave him, and did thereto add</LINE>
<LINE>My love, without retention or restraint,</LINE>
<LINE>All his in dedication. For his sake</LINE>
<LINE>Did I expose myself (pure for his love)</LINE>
<LINE>Into the danger of this adverse town,</LINE>
<LINE>Drew to defend him when he was beset;</LINE>
<LINE>Where being apprehended, his false cunning</LINE>
<LINE>(Not meaning to partake with me in danger)</LINE>
<LINE>Taught him to face me out of his acquaintance,</LINE>
<LINE>And grew a twenty years removed thing</LINE>
<LINE>While one would wink; denied me mine own purse,</LINE>
<LINE>Which I had recommended to his use</LINE>
<LINE>Not half an hour before.</LINE>

<LINE>Why should I not (had I the heart to do it),</LINE>
<LINE>Like to th&#8217; Egyptian thief at point of death,</LINE>
<LINE>Kill what I love? (a savage jealousy</LINE>
<LINE>That sometime savors nobly), but hear me this:</LINE>
<LINE>Since you to non-regardance cast my faith,</LINE>
<LINE>And that I partly know the instrument</LINE>
<LINE>That screws me from my true place in your favor,</LINE>
<LINE>Live you the marble-breasted tyrant still.</LINE>
<LINE>But this your minion, whom I know you love,</LINE>
<LINE>And whom, by heaven I swear, I tender dearly,</LINE>
<LINE>Him will I tear out of that cruel eye,</LINE>
<LINE>Where he sits crowned in his master&#8217;s spite.</LINE>
<LINE>Come, boy, with me, my thoughts are ripe in mischief.</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll sacrifice the lamb that I do love,</LINE>
<LINE>To spite a raven&#8217;s heart within a dove.</LINE>

<LINE>Of here and every where. I had a sister,</LINE>
<LINE>Whom the blind waves and surges have devour&#8217;d.</LINE>
<LINE>Of charity, what kin are you to me?</LINE>
<LINE>What countryman? What name? What parentage?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VIO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Of Messaline; Sebastian was my father,</LINE>
<LINE>Such a Sebastian was my brother too;</LINE>
<LINE>So went he suited to his watery tomb.</LINE>
<LINE>If spirits can assume both form and suit,</LINE>
<LINE>You come to fright us.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SEB.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">A spirit I am indeed,</LINE>
<LINE>But am in that dimension grossly clad</LINE>
<LINE>Which from the womb I did participate.</LINE>
<LINE>Were you a woman, as the rest goes even,</LINE>
<LINE>I should my tears let fall upon your cheek,</LINE>
<LINE>And say, &#8220;Thrice welcome, drowned Viola!&#8221;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VIO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My father had a mole upon his brow.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SEB.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And so had mine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VIO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And died that day when Viola from her birth</LINE>
<LINE>Had numb&#8217;red thirteen years.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SEB.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, that record is lively in my soul!</LINE>
<LINE>He finished indeed his mortal act</LINE>
<LINE>That day that made my sister thirteen years.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VIO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If nothing lets to make us happy both</LINE>
<LINE>But this my masculine usurp&#8217;d attire,</LINE>
<LINE>Do not embrace me till each circumstance</LINE>
<LINE>Of place, time, fortune, do cohere and jump</LINE>
<LINE>That I am Viola&#8212;which to confirm,</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll bring you to a captain in this town,</LINE>
<LINE>Where lie my maiden weeds; by whose gentle help</LINE>
<LINE>I was preserv&#8217;d to serve this noble count.</LINE>
<LINE>All the occurrence of my fortune since</LINE>
<LINE>Hath been between this lady and this lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SEB.</SPEAKER><STAGEDIR>To Olivia.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>So comes it, lady, you have been mistook;</LINE>
<LINE>But Nature to her bias drew in that.</LINE>
<LINE>You would have been contracted to a maid,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor are you therein, by my life, deceiv&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>You are betroth&#8217;d both to a maid and man.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Be not amaz&#8217;d, right noble is his blood.</LINE>
<LINE>If this be so, as yet the glass seems true,</LINE>
<LINE>I shall have share in this most happy wrack.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>To Viola.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times</LINE>
<LINE>Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VIO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And all those sayings will I over swear,</LINE>
<LINE>And all those swearings keep as true in soul</LINE>
<LINE>As doth that orbed continent the fire</LINE>
<LINE>That severs day from night.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Give me thy hand,</LINE>
<LINE>And let me see thee in thy woman&#8217;s weeds.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VIO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The captain that did bring me first on shore</LINE>
<LINE>Hath my maid&#8217;s garments. He upon some action</LINE>
<LINE>Is now in durance, at Malvolio&#8217;s suit,</LINE>
<LINE>A gentleman, and follower of my lady&#8217;s.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLI.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He shall enlarge him; fetch Malvolio hither.</LINE>
<LINE>And yet, alas, now I remember me,</LINE>
<LINE>They say, poor gentleman, he&#8217;s much distract.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Clown with a letter, and Fabian.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>A most extracting frenzy of mine own</LINE>
<LINE>From my remembrance clearly banish&#8217;d his.</LINE>
<LINE>How does he, sirrah?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Truly, madam, he holds Belzebub at the stave&#8217;s end as well as a man in his case may do. H&#8217;as here writ a letter to you; I should have given&#8217;t you today morning. But as a madman&#8217;s epistles are no gospels, so it skills not much when they are deliver&#8217;d.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLI.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Open&#8217;t and read it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Look then to be well edified when the fool delivers the madman.<STAGEDIR>Reads madly.</STAGEDIR> &#8220;By the Lord, madam&#8221;&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLI.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How now, art thou mad?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, madam, I do but read madness. And your ladyship will have it as it ought to be, you must allow vox.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLI.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Prithee read i&#8217; thy right wits.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So I do, madonna; but to read his right wits is to read thus; therefore perpend, my princess, and give ear.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLI.</SPEAKER>
<STAGEDIR>To Fabian.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Read it you, sirrah.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FAB.</SPEAKER>
<STAGEDIR>Reads.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>&#8220;By the Lord, madam, you wrong me, and the world shall know it. Though you have put me into darkness, and given your drunken cousin rule over me, yet have I the benefit of my senses as well as your ladyship. I have your own letter that induc&#8217;d me to the semblance I put on; with the which I doubt not but to do myself much right, or you much shame. Think of me as you please. I leave my duty a little unthought of, and speak out of my injury.</LINE>
<LINE>The madly-us&#8217;d Malvolio.&#8221;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLI.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Did he write this?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, madam.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This savors not much of distraction.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLI.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>See him deliver&#8217;d, Fabian, bring him hither.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exit Fabian.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>My lord, so please you, these things further thought on,</LINE>
<LINE>To think me as well a sister as a wife,</LINE>
<LINE>One day shall crown th&#8217; alliance on&#8217;t, so please you,</LINE>
<LINE>Here at my house and at my proper cost.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Madam, I am most apt t&#8217; embrace your offer.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>To Viola.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Your master quits you; and for your service done him,</LINE>
<LINE>So much against the mettle of your sex,</LINE>
<LINE>So far beneath your soft and tender breeding,</LINE>
<LINE>And since you call&#8217;d me master for so long,</LINE>
<LINE>Here is my hand&#8212;you shall from this time be</LINE>
<LINE>Your master&#8217;s mistress.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLI.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">A sister! You are she.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Fabian with Malvolio.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUKE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is this the madman?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLI.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Ay, my lord, this same.</LINE>
<LINE>How now, Malvolio?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Madam, you have done me wrong,</LINE>
<LINE>Notorious wrong.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLI.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Have I, Malvolio? No.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Lady, you have. Pray you peruse that letter.</LINE>
<LINE>You must not now deny it is your hand;</LINE>
<LINE>Write from it if you can, in hand or phrase,</LINE>
<LINE>Or say &#8217;tis not your seal, not your invention.</LINE>
<LINE>You can say none of this. Well, grant it then,</LINE>
<LINE>And tell me, in the modesty of honor,</LINE>
<LINE>Why you have given me such clear lights of favor,</LINE>
<LINE>Bade me come smiling and cross-garter&#8217;d to you,</LINE>
<LINE>To put on yellow stockings, and to frown</LINE>
<LINE>Upon Sir Toby and the lighter people;</LINE>
<LINE>And acting this in an obedient hope,</LINE>
<LINE>Why have you suffer&#8217;d me to be imprison&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Kept in a dark house, visited by the priest,</LINE>
<LINE>And made the most notorious geck and gull</LINE>
<LINE>That e&#8217;er invention play&#8217;d on? Tell me why!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLI.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alas, Malvolio, this is not my writing,</LINE>
<LINE>Though I confess much like the character;</LINE>
<LINE>But out of question &#8217;tis Maria&#8217;s hand.</LINE>
<LINE>And now I do bethink me, it was she</LINE>
<LINE>First told me thou wast mad. Then cam&#8217;st in smiling,</LINE>
<LINE>And in such forms which here were presuppos&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>Upon thee in the letter. Prithee be content.</LINE>
<LINE>This practice hath most shrewdly pass&#8217;d upon thee;</LINE>
<LINE>But when we know the grounds and authors of it,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou shalt be both the plaintiff and the judge</LINE>
<LINE>Of thine own cause.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FAB.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Good madam, hear me speak,</LINE>
<LINE>And let no quarrel nor no brawl to come</LINE>
<LINE>Taint the condition of this present hour,</LINE>
<LINE>Which I have wond&#8217;red at. In hope it shall not,</LINE>
<LINE>Most freely I confess, myself and Toby</LINE>
<LINE>Set this device against Malvolio here,</LINE>
<LINE>Upon some stubborn and uncourteous parts</LINE>
<LINE>We had conceiv&#8217;d against him. Maria writ</LINE>
<LINE>The letter at Sir Toby&#8217;s great importance,</LINE>
<LINE>In recompense whereof he hath married her.</LINE>
<LINE>How with a sportful malice it was follow&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>May rather pluck on laughter than revenge,</LINE>
<LINE>If that the injuries be justly weigh&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>That have on both sides pass&#8217;d.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OLI.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alas, poor fool, how have they baffled thee!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, &#8220;some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrown upon them.&#8221; I was one, sir, in this enterlude&#8212;one Sir Topas, sir, but that&#8217;s all one. &#8220;By the Lord, fool, I am not mad.&#8221; But do you remember? &#8220;Madam, why laugh you at such a barren rascal? And you smile not, he&#8217;s gagg&#8217;d.&#8221; And thus the whirligig of time brings in his revenges.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll be reveng&#8217;d on the whole pack of you.</LINE>

<LINE>He hath not told us of the captain yet.</LINE>
<LINE>When that is known, and golden time convents,</LINE>
<LINE>A solemn combination shall be made</LINE>
<LINE>Of our dear souls. Mean time, sweet sister,</LINE>
<LINE>We will not part from hence. Cesario, come&#8212;</LINE>
