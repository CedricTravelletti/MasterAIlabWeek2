<scenetitle>Scene 1</scenetitle>
<scenelocation>Athens. The palace of Theseus.</scenelocation>
<scenepersonae>(Theseus, Hippolyta, Philostrate, Egeus, Hermia, Lysander, Demetrius, Helena)</scenepersonae>

<stagedir>Enter Theseus, Hippolyta, Philostrate, with others.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>THE.</speaker>
<line>Now, fair Hippolyta, our nuptial hour</line>
<line>Draws on apace. Four happy days bring in</line>
<line>Another moon; but O, methinks, how slow</line>
<line>This old moon wanes! She lingers my desires,</line>
<line>Like to a step-dame, or a dowager,</line>
<line>Long withering out a young man&#8217;s revenue.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HIP.</speaker>
<line>Four days will quickly steep themselves in night;</line>
<line>Four nights will quickly dream away the time;</line>
<line>And then the moon, like to a silver bow</line>
<line>New bent in heaven, shall behold the night</line>
<line>Of our solemnities.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>THE.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Go, Philostrate,</line>
<line>Stir up the Athenian youth to merriments,</line>
<line>Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth,</line>
<line>Turn melancholy forth to funerals:</line>
<line>The pale companion is not for our pomp.</line>

<stagedir>Exit Philostrate.</stagedir>
<line>Hippolyta, I woo&#8217;d thee with my sword,</line>
<line>And won thy love doing thee injuries;</line>
<line>But I will wed thee in another key,</line>
<line>With pomp, with triumph, and with revelling.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Egeus and his daughter Hermia and Lysander and Demetrius.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>EGE.</speaker>
<line>Happy be Theseus, our renowned Duke!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>THE.</speaker>
<line>Thanks, good Egeus. What&#8217;s the news with thee?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>EGE.</speaker>
<line>Full of vexation come I, with complaint</line>
<line>Against my child, my daughter Hermia.</line>
<line>Stand forth, Demetrius. My noble lord,</line>
<line>This man hath my consent to marry her.</line>
<line>Stand forth, Lysander. And, my gracious Duke,</line>
<line>This man hath bewitch&#8217;d the bosom of my child.</line>
<line>Thou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes,</line>
<line>And interchang&#8217;d love-tokens with my child;</line>
<line>Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung</line>
<line>With faining voice verses of faining love,</line>
<line>And stol&#8217;n the impression of her fantasy</line>
<line>With bracelets of thy hair, rings, gawds, conceits,</line>
<line>Knacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats&#8212;messengers</line>
<line>Of strong prevailment in unhardened youth.</line>
<line>With cunning hast thou filch&#8217;d my daughter&#8217;s heart,</line>
<line>Turn&#8217;d her obedience (which is due to me)</line>
<line>To stubborn harshness. And, my gracious Duke,</line>
<line>Be it so she will not here before your Grace</line>
<line>Consent to marry with Demetrius,</line>
<line>I beg the ancient privilege of Athens:</line>
<line>As she is mine, I may dispose of her;</line>
<line>Which shall be either to this gentleman,</line>
<line>Or to her death, according to our law</line>
<line>Immediately provided in that case.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>THE.</speaker>
<line>What say you, Hermia? Be advis&#8217;d, fair maid.</line>
<line>To you your father should be as a god;</line>
<line>One that compos&#8217;d your beauties; yea, and one</line>
<line>To whom you are but as a form in wax,</line>
<line>By him imprinted, and within his power,</line>
<line>To leave the figure, or disfigure it.</line>
<line>Demetrius is a worthy gentleman.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HER.</speaker>
<line>So is Lysander.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>THE.</speaker>
<line offset="3">In himself he is;</line>
<line>But in this kind, wanting your father&#8217;s voice,</line>
<line>The other must be held the worthier.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HER.</speaker>
<line>I would my father look&#8217;d but with my eyes.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>THE.</speaker>
<line>Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HER.</speaker>
<line>I do entreat your Grace to pardon me.</line>
<line>I know not by what power I am made bold,</line>
<line>Nor how it may concern my modesty,</line>
<line>In such a presence here to plead my thoughts;</line>
<line>But I beseech your Grace that I may know</line>
<line>The worst that may befall me in this case,</line>
<line>If I refuse to wed Demetrius.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>THE.</speaker>
<line>Either to die the death, or to abjure</line>
<line>Forever the society of men.</line>
<line>Therefore, fair Hermia, question your desires,</line>
<line>Know of your youth, examine well your blood,</line>
<line>Whether (if you yield not to your father&#8217;s choice)</line>
<line>You can endure the livery of a nun,</line>
<line>For aye to be in shady cloister mew&#8217;d,</line>
<line>To live a barren sister all your life,</line>
<line>Chaunting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon.</line>
<line>Thrice blessed they that master so their blood</line>
<line>To undergo such maiden pilgrimage;</line>
<line>But earthlier happy is the rose distill&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Than that which withering on the virgin thorn</line>
<line>Grows, lives, and dies in single blessedness.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HER.</speaker>
<line>So will I grow, so live, so die, my lord,</line>
<line>Ere I will yield my virgin patent up</line>
<line>Unto his lordship, whose unwished yoke</line>
<line>My soul consents not to give sovereignty.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>THE.</speaker>
<line>Take time to pause, and by the next new moon&#8212;</line>
<line>The sealing-day betwixt my love and me</line>
<line>For everlasting bond of fellowship&#8212;</line>
<line>Upon that day either prepare to die</line>
<line>For disobedience to your father&#8217;s will,</line>
<line>Or else to wed Demetrius, as he would,</line>
<line>Or on Diana&#8217;s altar to protest</line>
<line>For aye austerity and single life.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DEM.</speaker>
<line>Relent, sweet Hermia, and, Lysander, yield</line>
<line>Thy crazed title to my certain right.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LYS.</speaker>
<line>You have her father&#8217;s love, Demetrius,</line>
<line>Let me have Hermia&#8217;s; do you marry him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>EGE.</speaker>
<line>Scornful Lysander, true, he hath my love;</line>
<line>And what is mine, my love shall render him.</line>
<line>And she is mine, and all my right of her</line>
<line>I do estate unto Demetrius.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LYS.</speaker>
<line>I am, my lord, as well deriv&#8217;d as he,</line>
<line>As well possess&#8217;d; my love is more than his;</line>
<line>My fortunes every way as fairly rank&#8217;d</line>
<line>(If not with vantage) as Demetrius&#8217;;</line>
<line>And (which is more than all these boasts can be)</line>
<line>I am belov&#8217;d of beauteous Hermia.</line>
<line>Why should not I then prosecute my right?</line>
<line>Demetrius, I&#8217;ll avouch it to his head,</line>
<line>Made love to Nedar&#8217;s daughter, Helena,</line>
<line>And won her soul; and she, sweet lady, dotes,</line>
<line>Devoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry,</line>
<line>Upon this spotted and inconstant man.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>THE.</speaker>
<line>I must confess that I have heard so much,</line>
<line>And with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof;</line>
<line>But, being over-full of self-affairs,</line>
<line>My mind did lose it. But, Demetrius, come,</line>
<line>And come, Egeus, you shall go with me;</line>
<line>I have some private schooling for you both.</line>
<line>For you, fair Hermia, look you arm yourself</line>
<line>To fit your fancies to your father&#8217;s will;</line>
<line>Or else the law of Athens yields you up</line>
<line>(Which by no means we may extenuate)</line>
<line>To death, or to a vow of single life.</line>
<line>Come, my Hippolyta; what cheer, my love?</line>
<line>Demetrius and Egeus, go along;</line>
<line>I must employ you in some business</line>
<line>Against our nuptial, and confer with you</line>
<line>Of something nearly that concerns yourselves.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>EGE.</speaker>
<line>With duty and desire we follow you.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exeunt. Manent Lysander and Hermia.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>LYS.</speaker>
<line>How now, my love? Why is your cheek so pale?</line>
<line>How chance the roses there do fade so fast?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HER.</speaker>
<line>Belike for want of rain; which I could well</line>
<line>Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LYS.</speaker>
<line>Ay me! For aught that I could ever read,</line>
<line>Could ever hear by tale or history,</line>
<line>The course of true love never did run smooth;</line>
<line>But either it was different in blood&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HER.</speaker>
<line>O cross! Too high to be enthrall&#8217;d to low.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LYS.</speaker>
<line>Or else misgraffed in respect of years&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HER.</speaker>
<line>O spite! Too old to be engag&#8217;d to young.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LYS.</speaker>
<line>Or else it stood upon the choice of friends&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HER.</speaker>
<line>O hell, to choose love by another&#8217;s eyes!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LYS.</speaker>
<line>Or if there were a sympathy in choice,</line>
<line>War, death, or sickness did lay siege to it,</line>
<line>Making it momentany as a sound,</line>
<line>Swift as a shadow, short as any dream,</line>
<line>Brief as the lightning in the collied night,</line>
<line>That, in a spleen, unfolds both heaven and earth;</line>
<line>And ere a man hath power to say &#8220;Behold!&#8221;</line>
<line>The jaws of darkness do devour it up:</line>
<line>So quick bright things come to confusion.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HER.</speaker>
<line>If then true lovers have been ever cross&#8217;d,</line>
<line>It stands as an edict in destiny.</line>
<line>Then let us teach our trial patience,</line>
<line>Because it is a customary cross,</line>
<line>As due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs,</line>
<line>Wishes and tears, poor fancy&#8217;s followers.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LYS.</speaker>
<line>A good persuasion; therefore hear me, Hermia:</line>
<line>I have a widow aunt, a dowager,</line>
<line>Of great revenue, and she hath no child.</line>
<line>From Athens is her house remote seven leagues;</line>
<line>And she respects me as her only son.</line>
<line>There, gentle Hermia, may I marry thee;</line>
<line>And to that place the sharp Athenian law</line>
<line>Cannot pursue us. If thou lovest me, then</line>
<line>Steal forth thy father&#8217;s house tomorrow night;</line>
<line>And in the wood, a league without the town</line>
<line>(Where I did meet thee once with Helena</line>
<line>To do observance to a morn of May),</line>
<line>There will I stay for thee.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HER.</speaker>
<line offset="5">My good Lysander,</line>
<line>I swear to thee, by Cupid&#8217;s strongest bow,</line>
<line>By his best arrow with the golden head,</line>
<line>By the simplicity of Venus&#8217; doves,</line>
<line>By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves,</line>
<line>And by that fire which burn&#8217;d the Carthage queen</line>
<line>When the false Troyan under sail was seen,</line>
<line>By all the vows that ever men have broke</line>
<line>(In number more than ever women spoke),</line>
<line>In that same place thou hast appointed me</line>
<line>Tomorrow truly will I meet with thee.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LYS.</speaker>
<line>Keep promise, love. Look, here comes Helena.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Helena.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>HER.</speaker>
<line>God speed fair Helena! Whither away?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HEL.</speaker>
<line>Call you me fair? That fair again unsay.</line>
<line>Demetrius loves your fair, O happy fair!</line>
<line>Your eyes are lodestars, and your tongue&#8217;s sweet air</line>
<line>More tuneable than lark to shepherd&#8217;s ear</line>
<line>When wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear.</line>
<line>Sickness is catching; O, were favor so,</line>
<line>Yours would I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go;</line>
<line>My ear should catch your voice, my eye your eye,</line>
<line>My tongue should catch your tongue&#8217;s sweet melody.</line>
<line>Were the world mine, Demetrius being bated,</line>
<line>The rest I&#8217;ll give to be to you translated.</line>
<line>O, teach me how you look, and with what art</line>
<line>You sway the motion of Demetrius&#8217; heart.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HER.</speaker>
<line>I frown upon him; yet he loves me still.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HEL.</speaker>
<line>O that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HER.</speaker>
<line>I give him curses; yet he gives me love.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HEL.</speaker>
<line>O that my prayers could such affection move!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HER.</speaker>
<line>The more I hate, the more he follows me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HEL.</speaker>
<line>The more I love, the more he hateth me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HER.</speaker>
<line>His folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HEL.</speaker>
<line>None but your beauty; would that fault were mine!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HER.</speaker>
<line>Take comfort; he no more shall see my face;</line>
<line>Lysander and myself will fly this place.</line>
<line>Before the time I did Lysander see,</line>
<line>Seem&#8217;d Athens as a paradise to me;</line>
<line>O then, what graces in my love do dwell,</line>
<line>That he hath turn&#8217;d a heaven unto a hell!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LYS.</speaker>
<line>Helen, to you our minds we will unfold:</line>
<line>Tomorrow night, when Phoebe doth behold</line>
<line>Her silver visage in the wat&#8217;ry glass,</line>
<line>Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass</line>
<line>(A time that lovers&#8217; flights doth still conceal),</line>
<line>Through Athens gates have we devis&#8217;d to steal.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HER.</speaker>
<line>And in the wood, where often you and I</line>
<line>Upon faint primrose beds were wont to lie,</line>
<line>Emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet,</line>
<line>There my Lysander and myself shall meet;</line>
<line>And thence from Athens turn away our eyes,</line>
<line>To seek new friends and stranger companies.</line>
<line>Farewell, sweet playfellow, pray thou for us;</line>
<line>And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius!</line>
<line>Keep word, Lysander; we must starve our sight</line>
<line>From lovers&#8217; food till morrow deep midnight.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LYS.</speaker>
<line>I will, my Hermia.</line>

<stagedir>Exit Hermia.</stagedir>
<line offset="4">Helena, <french xml:lang="fr">adieu</french>:</line>
<line>As you on him, Demetrius dote on you!</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit Lysander.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>HEL.</speaker>
<line>How happy some o&#8217;er other some can be!</line>
<line>Through Athens I am thought as fair as she.</line>
<line>But what of that? Demetrius thinks not so;</line>
<line>He will not know what all but he do know;</line>
<line>And as he errs, doting on Hermia&#8217;s eyes,</line>
<line>So I, admiring of his qualities.</line>
<line>Things base and vile, holding no quantity,</line>
<line>Love can transpose to form and dignity.</line>
<line>Love looks not with the eyes but with the mind;</line>
<line>And therefore is wing&#8217;d Cupid painted blind.</line>
<line>Nor hath Love&#8217;s mind of any judgment taste;</line>
<line>Wings, and no eyes, figure unheedy haste;</line>
<line>And therefore is Love said to be a child,</line>
<line>Because in choice he is so oft beguil&#8217;d.</line>
<line>As waggish boys in game themselves forswear,</line>
<line>So the boy Love is perjur&#8217;d every where;</line>
<line>For ere Demetrius look&#8217;d on Hermia&#8217;s eyne,</line>
<line>He hail&#8217;d down oaths that he was only mine;</line>
<line>And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt,</line>
<line>So he dissolv&#8217;d, and show&#8217;rs of oaths did melt.</line>
<line>I will go tell him of fair Hermia&#8217;s flight;</line>
<line>Then to the wood will he tomorrow night</line>
<line>Pursue her; and for this intelligence</line>
<line>If I have thanks, it is a dear expense.</line>
<line>But herein mean I to enrich my pain,</line>
<line>To have his sight thither and back again.</line>

<scenetitle>Scene 2</scenetitle>
<scenelocation>Athens. Quince&#8217;s house.</scenelocation>
<scenepersonae>(Quince, Snug, Bottom, Flute, Snout, Starveling)</scenepersonae>

<stagedir>Enter Quince the carpenter and Snug the joiner and Bottom the weaver and Flute the bellows-mender and Snout the tinker and Starveling the tailor.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>QUIN.</speaker>
<line>Is all our company here?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BOT.</speaker>
<line>You were best to call them generally, man by man, according to the scrip.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>QUIN.</speaker>
<line>Here is the scroll of every man&#8217;s name, which is thought fit, through all Athens, to play in our enterlude before the Duke and the Duchess, on his wedding-day at night.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BOT.</speaker>
<line>First, good Peter Quince, say what the play treats on; then read the names of the actors; and so grow to a point.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>QUIN.</speaker>
<line>Marry, our play is The most lamentable comedy and most cruel death of Pyramus and Thisby.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BOT.</speaker>
<line>A very good piece of work, I assure you, and a merry. Now, good Peter Quince, call forth your actors by the scroll. Masters, spread yourselves.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>QUIN.</speaker>
<line>Answer as I call you. Nick Bottom the weaver.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BOT.</speaker>
<line>Ready. Name what part I am for, and proceed.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>QUIN.</speaker>
<line>You, Nick Bottom, are set down for Pyramus.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BOT.</speaker>
<line>What is Pyramus? A lover, or a tyrant?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>QUIN.</speaker>
<line>A lover, that kills himself most gallant for love.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BOT.</speaker>
<line>That will ask some tears in the true performing of it. If I do it, let the audience look to their eyes. I will move storms; I will condole in some measure. To the rest&#8212;yet my chief humor is for a tyrant. I could play Ercles rarely, or a part to tear a cat in, to make all split.</line>
<line><RECITE>&#8220;The raging rocks</RECITE></line>
<line><RECITE>And shivering shocks</RECITE></line>
<line><RECITE>Shall break the locks</RECITE></line>
<line><RECITE>Of prison gates;</RECITE></line>
<line><RECITE>And Phibbus&#8217; car</RECITE></line>
<line><RECITE>Shall shine from far,</RECITE></line>
<line><RECITE>And make and mar</RECITE></line>
<line><RECITE>The foolish Fates.&#8221;</RECITE></line>
<line>This was lofty! Now name the rest of the players. This is Ercles&#8217; vein, a tyrant&#8217;s vein; a lover is more condoling.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>QUIN.</speaker>
<line>Francis Flute the bellows-mender.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FLU.</speaker>
<line>Here, Peter Quince.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>QUIN.</speaker>
<line>Flute, you must take Thisby on you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FLU.</speaker>
<line>What is Thisby? A wand&#8217;ring knight?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>QUIN.</speaker>
<line>It is the lady that Pyramus must love.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FLU.</speaker>
<line>Nay, faith; let not me play a woman; I have a beard coming.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>QUIN.</speaker>
<line>That&#8217;s all one; you shall play it in a mask, and you may speak as small as you will.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BOT.</speaker>
<line>And I may hide my face, let me play Thisby too. I&#8217;ll speak in a monstrous little voice, &#8220;Thisne! Thisne! Ah, Pyramus, my lover dear! Thy Thisby dear, and lady dear!&#8221;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>QUIN.</speaker>
<line>No, no, you must play Pyramus; and, Flute, you Thisby.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BOT.</speaker>
<line>Well, proceed.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>QUIN.</speaker>
<line>Robin Starveling the tailor.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>STAR.</speaker>
<line>Here, Peter Quince.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>QUIN.</speaker>
<line>Robin Starveling, you must play Thisby&#8217;s mother. Tom Snout the tinker.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SNOUT.</speaker>
<line>Here, Peter Quince.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>QUIN.</speaker>
<line>You, Pyramus&#8217; father; myself, Thisby&#8217;s father; Snug the joiner, you the lion&#8217;s part. And I hope here is a play fitted.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SNUG.</speaker>
<line>Have you the lion&#8217;s part written? Pray you, if it be, give it me, for I am slow of study.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>QUIN.</speaker>
<line>You may do it extempore, for it is nothing but roaring.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BOT.</speaker>
<line>Let me play the lion too. I will roar, that I will do any man&#8217;s heart good to hear me. I will roar, that I will make the Duke say, &#8220;Let him roar again; let him roar again.&#8221;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>QUIN.</speaker>
<line>And you should do it too terribly, you would fright the Duchess and the ladies, that they would shrike; and that were enough to hang us all.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ALL.</speaker>
<line>That would hang us, every mother&#8217;s son.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BOT.</speaker>
<line>I grant you, friends, if you should fright the ladies out of their wits, they would have no more discretion but to hang us; but I will aggravate my voice so that I will roar you as gently as any sucking dove; I will roar you and &#8217;twere any nightingale.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>QUIN.</speaker>
<line>You can play no part but Pyramus; for Pyramus is a sweet-fac&#8217;d man; a proper man as one shall see in a summer&#8217;s day; a most lovely gentleman-like man: therefore you must needs play Pyramus.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BOT.</speaker>
<line>Well; I will undertake it. What beard were I best to play it in?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>QUIN.</speaker>
<line>Why, what you will.</line>

<line>Some of your French crowns have no hair at all; and then you will play barefac&#8217;d. But, masters, here are your parts, and I am to entreat you, request you, and desire you, to con them by tomorrow night; and meet me in the palace wood, a mile without the town, by moonlight; there will we rehearse; for if we meet in the city, we shall be dogg&#8217;d with company, and our devices known. In the meantime I will draw a bill of properties, such as our play wants. I pray you fail me not.</line>

<line type="lyric">Over park, over pale,</line>
<line type="lyric">Thorough flood, thorough fire,</line>
<line type="lyric">I do wander every where,</line>

<line type="lyric">Those be rubies, fairy favors,</line>

<speaker>PUCK.</speaker>
<line>The King doth keep his revels here tonight;</line>
<line>Take heed the Queen come not within his sight;</line>
<line>For Oberon is passing fell and wrath,</line>
<line>Because that she as her attendant hath</line>
<line>A lovely boy stolen from an Indian king;</line>
<line>She never had so sweet a changeling.</line>
<line>And jealous Oberon would have the child</line>
<line>Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild;</line>
<line>But she, perforce, withholds the loved boy,</line>
<line>Crowns him with flowers, and makes him all her joy.</line>
<line>And now they never meet in grove or green,</line>
<line>By fountain clear, or spangled starlight sheen,</line>
<line>But they do square, that all their elves for fear</line>
<line>Creep into acorn-cups, and hide them there.</line>

<line>Either I mistake your shape and making quite,</line>

<line>That frights the maidens of the villagery,</line>
<line>Skim milk, and sometimes labor in the quern,</line>
<line>And bootless make the breathless huswife churn,</line>
<line>And sometime make the drink to bear no barm,</line>
<line>Mislead night-wanderers, laughing at their harm?</line>
<line>Those that Hobgoblin call you, and sweet Puck,</line>

<speech>
<speaker>PUCK.</speaker>
<line offset="3">Thou speakest aright;</line>
<line>I am that merry wanderer of the night.</line>
<line>I jest to Oberon and make him smile</line>
<line>When I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile,</line>
<line>Neighing in likeness of a filly foal;</line>
<line>And sometime lurk I in a gossip&#8217;s bowl,</line>
<line>In very likeness of a roasted crab,</line>
<line>And when she drinks, against her lips I bob,</line>
<line>And on her withered dewlop pour the ale.</line>
<line>The wisest aunt, telling the saddest tale,</line>
<line>Sometime for three-foot stool mistaketh me;</line>
<line>Then slip I from her bum, down topples she,</line>
<line>And &#8220;tailor&#8221; cries, and falls into a cough;</line>
<line>And then the whole quire hold their hips and loff,</line>

<stagedir>Enter the King of Fairies Oberon at one door with his Train, and the Queen Titania at another with hers.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>OBE.</speaker>
<line>Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TITA.</speaker>
<line>What, jealous Oberon? Fairies, skip hence&#8212;</line>
<line>I have forsworn his bed and company.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OBE.</speaker>
<line>Tarry, rash wanton! Am not I thy lord?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TITA.</speaker>
<line>Then I must be thy lady; but I know</line>
<line>When thou hast stolen away from fairy land,</line>
<line>And in the shape of Corin sat all day,</line>
<line>Playing on pipes of corn, and versing love,</line>
<line>To amorous Phillida. Why art thou here</line>
<line>Come from the farthest steep of India?</line>
<line>But that, forsooth, the bouncing Amazon,</line>
<line>Your buskin&#8217;d mistress, and your warrior love,</line>
<line>To Theseus must be wedded, and you come</line>
<line>To give their bed joy and prosperity.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OBE.</speaker>
<line>How canst thou thus for shame, Titania,</line>
<line>Glance at my credit with Hippolyta,</line>
<line>Knowing I know thy love to Theseus?</line>
<line>Didst not thou lead him through the glimmering night</line>
<line>From Perigenia, whom he ravished?</line>
<line>And make him with fair Aegles break his faith,</line>
<line>With Ariadne, and Antiopa?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TITA.</speaker>
<line>These are the forgeries of jealousy;</line>
<line>And never, since the middle summer&#8217;s spring,</line>
<line>Met we on hill, in dale, forest, or mead,</line>
<line>By paved fountain or by rushy brook,</line>
<line>Or in the beached margent of the sea,</line>
<line>To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind,</line>
<line>But with thy brawls thou hast disturb&#8217;d our sport.</line>
<line>Therefore the winds, piping to us in vain,</line>
<line>As in revenge, have suck&#8217;d up from the sea</line>
<line>Contagious fogs; which, falling in the land,</line>
<line>Hath every pelting river made so proud</line>
<line>That they have overborne their continents.</line>
<line>The ox hath therefore stretch&#8217;d his yoke in vain,</line>
<line>The ploughman lost his sweat, and the green corn</line>
<line>Hath rotted ere his youth attain&#8217;d a beard.</line>
<line>The fold stands empty in the drowned field,</line>
<line>And crows are fatted with the murrion flock;</line>
<line>The nine men&#8217;s morris is fill&#8217;d up with mud,</line>
<line>And the quaint mazes in the wanton green,</line>
<line>For lack of tread, are undistinguishable.</line>
<line>The human mortals want their winter here;</line>
<line>No night is now with hymn or carol blest.</line>
<line>Therefore the moon (the governess of floods),</line>
<line>Pale in her anger, washes all the air,</line>
<line>That rheumatic diseases do abound.</line>
<line>And thorough this distemperature, we see</line>
<line>The seasons alter: hoary-headed frosts</line>
<line>Fall in the fresh lap of the crimson rose,</line>
<line>And on old Hiems&#8217; thin and icy crown</line>
<line>An odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds</line>
<line>Is, as in mockery, set; the spring, the summer,</line>
<line>The childing autumn, angry winter, change</line>
<line>Their wonted liveries; and the mazed world,</line>
<line>By their increase, now knows not which is which.</line>
<line>And this same progeny of evils comes</line>
<line>From our debate, from our dissension;</line>
<line>We are their parents and original.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OBE.</speaker>
<line>Do you amend it then; it lies in you.</line>
<line>Why should Titania cross her Oberon?</line>
<line>I do but beg a little changeling boy,</line>
<line>To be my henchman.</line>

<speaker>TITA.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Set your heart at rest;</line>
<line>The fairy land buys not the child of me.</line>
<line>His mother was a vot&#8217;ress of my order,</line>
<line>And in the spiced Indian air, by night,</line>
<line>Full often hath she gossip&#8217;d by my side,</line>
<line>And sat with me on Neptune&#8217;s yellow sands,</line>
<line>Marking th&#8217; embarked traders on the flood;</line>
<line>When we have laugh&#8217;d to see the sails conceive</line>
<line>And grow big-bellied with the wanton wind;</line>
<line>Which she, with pretty and with swimming gait,</line>
<line>Following (her womb then rich with my young squire)</line>
<line>Would imitate, and sail upon the land</line>
<line>To fetch me trifles, and return again,</line>
<line>As from a voyage, rich with merchandise.</line>
<line>But she, being mortal, of that boy did die,</line>
<line>And for her sake do I rear up her boy;</line>
<line>And for her sake I will not part with him.</line>

<line>How long within this wood intend you stay?</line>

<speaker>TITA.</speaker>
<line>Perchance till after Theseus&#8217; wedding-day.</line>
<line>If you will patiently dance in our round,</line>
<line>And see our moonlight revels, go with us;</line>
<line>If not, shun me, and I will spare your haunts.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OBE.</speaker>
<line>Give me that boy, and I will go with thee.</line>

<line>Not for thy fairy kingdom. Fairies, away!</line>
<line>We shall chide downright, if I longer stay.</line>

<stagedir>Exeunt Titania and her Train.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>OBE.</speaker>
<line>Well; go thy way. Thou shalt not from this grove</line>
<line>Till I torment thee for this injury.</line>
<line>My gentle Puck, come hither. Thou rememb&#8217;rest</line>
<line>Since once I sat upon a promontory,</line>
<line>And heard a mermaid on a dolphin&#8217;s back</line>
<line>Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath</line>
<line>That the rude sea grew civil at her song,</line>
<line>And certain stars shot madly from their spheres,</line>

<speaker>OBE.</speaker>
<line>That very time I saw (but thou couldst not),</line>
<line>Flying between the cold moon and the earth,</line>
<line>Cupid all arm&#8217;d. A certain aim he took</line>
<line>At a fair vestal throned by the west,</line>
<line>And loos&#8217;d his love-shaft smartly from his bow,</line>
<line>As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts;</line>
<line>But I might see young Cupid&#8217;s fiery shaft</line>
<line>Quench&#8217;d in the chaste beams of the wat&#8217;ry moon,</line>
<line>And the imperial vot&#8217;ress passed on,</line>
<line>In maiden meditation, fancy-free.</line>
<line>Yet mark&#8217;d I where the bolt of Cupid fell.</line>
<line>It fell upon a little western flower,</line>
<line>Before milk-white, now purple with love&#8217;s wound,</line>
<line>And maidens call it love-in-idleness.</line>
<line>Fetch me that flow&#8217;r; the herb I showed thee once.</line>
<line>The juice of it on sleeping eyelids laid</line>
<line>Will make or man or woman madly dote</line>
<line>Upon the next live creature that it sees.</line>
<line>Fetch me this herb, and be thou here again</line>
<line>Ere the leviathan can swim a league.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>HEL.</speaker>
<line>Your virtue is my privilege. For that</line>
<line>It is not night when I do see your face,</line>
<line>Therefore I think I am not in the night,</line>
<line>Nor doth this wood lack worlds of company,</line>
<line>For you in my respect are all the world.</line>
<line>Then how can it be said I am alone,</line>
<line>When all the world is here to look on me?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DEM.</speaker>
<line>I&#8217;ll run from thee, and hide me in the brakes,</line>

<line>The wildest hath not such a heart as you.</line>
<line>Run when you will; the story shall be chang&#8217;d:</line>

<line>The dove pursues the griffin; the mild hind</line>
<line>Makes speed to catch the tiger&#8212;bootless speed,</line>
<line>When cowardice pursues and valor flies.</line>
</speech>

<speaker>DEM.</speaker>
<line>I will not stay thy questions. Let me go;</line>

<line>Ay, in the temple, in the town, the field,</line>
<line>You do me mischief. Fie, Demetrius!</line>
<line>Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex.</line>
<line>We cannot fight for love, as men may do.</line>
<line>We should be woo&#8217;d, and were not made to woo.</line>

<stagedir>Exit Demetrius.</stagedir>

<line>O, I am out of breath in this fond chase!</line>
<line>The more my prayer, the lesser is my grace.</line>
<line>Happy is Hermia, wheresoe&#8217;er she lies,</line>
<line>For she hath blessed and attractive eyes.</line>
<line>How came her eyes so bright? Not with salt tears;</line>
<line>If so, my eyes are oft&#8217;ner wash&#8217;d than hers.</line>
<line>No, no; I am as ugly as a bear;</line>
<line>For beasts that meet me run away for fear.</line>
<line>Therefore no marvel though Demetrius</line>
<line>Do, as a monster, fly my presence thus.</line>
<line>What wicked and dissembling glass of mine</line>
<line>Made me compare with Hermia&#8217;s sphery eyne!</line>
<line>But who is here? Lysander! On the ground?</line>
<line>Dead, or asleep? I see no blood, no wound.</line>
<line>Lysander, if you live, good sir, awake.</line>

<line>Is that vile name to perish on my sword!</line>

<line>Do not say so, Lysander, say not so.</line>
<line>What though he love your Hermia? Lord, what though?</line>
<line>Yet Hermia still loves you; then be content.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>LYS.</speaker>
<line>Content with Hermia? No; I do repent</line>
<line>The tedious minutes I with her have spent.</line>
<line>Not Hermia, but Helena I love.</line>
<line>Who will not change a raven for a dove?</line>
<line>The will of man is by his reason sway&#8217;d;</line>
<line>And reason says you are the worthier maid.</line>
<line>Things growing are not ripe until their season,</line>
<line>So I, being young, till now ripe not to reason;</line>
<line>And touching now the point of human skill,</line>
<line>Reason becomes the marshal to my will,</line>

<line>Good troth, you do me wrong (good sooth, you do)</line>

<line>Or as the heresies that men do leave</line>

<line>Are we all met?</line>

<speech>
<speaker>QUIN.</speaker>
<line>Pat, pat; and here&#8217;s a marvail&#8217;s convenient place for our rehearsal. This green plot shall be our stage, this hawthorn brake our tiring-house, and we will do it in action as we will do it before the Duke.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BOT.</speaker>
<line>Peter Quince!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>QUIN.</speaker>
<line>What sayest thou, bully Bottom?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BOT.</speaker>
<line>There are things in this comedy of Pyramus and Thisby that will never please. First, Pyramus must draw a sword to kill himself; which the ladies cannot abide. How answer you that?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SNOUT.</speaker>
<line>By&#8217;r lakin, a parlous fear.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>STAR.</speaker>
<line>I believe we must leave the killing out, when all is done.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BOT.</speaker>
<line>Not a whit! I have a device to make all well. Write me a prologue, and let the prologue seem to say we will do no harm with our swords, and that Pyramus is not kill&#8217;d indeed; and for the more better assurance, tell them that I Pyramus am not Pyramus, but Bottom the weaver. This will put them out of fear.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>QUIN.</speaker>
<line>Well; we will have such a prologue, and it shall be written in eight and six.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BOT.</speaker>
<line>No; make it two more; let it be written in eight and eight.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SNOUT.</speaker>
<line>Will not the ladies be afeard of the lion?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>STAR.</speaker>
<line>I fear it, I promise you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BOT.</speaker>
<line>Masters, you ought to consider with yourselves, to bring in (God shield us!) a lion among ladies, is a most dreadful thing; for there is not a more fearful wild-fowl than your lion living; and we ought to look to&#8217;t.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SNOUT.</speaker>
<line>Therefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BOT.</speaker>
<line>Nay; you must name his name, and half his face must be seen through the lion&#8217;s neck, and he himself muse speak through, saying thus, or to the same defect: &#8220;Ladies,&#8221; or &#8220;Fair ladies, I would wish you,&#8221; or &#8220;I would request you,&#8221; or &#8220;I would entreat you, not to fear, not to tremble: my life for yours. If you think I come hither as a lion, it were pity of my life. No! I am no such thing; I am a man as other men are&#8221;; and there indeed let him name his name, and tell them plainly he is Snug the joiner.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>QUIN.</speaker>
<line>Well; it shall be so. But there is two hard things: that is, to bring the moonlight into a chamber; for you know, Pyramus and Thisby meet by moonlight.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SNOUT.</speaker>
<line>Doth the moon shine that night we play our play?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BOT.</speaker>
<line>A calendar, a calendar! Look in the almanac. Find out moonshine, find out moonshine.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>QUIN.</speaker>
<line>Yes; it doth shine that night.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BOT.</speaker>
<line>Why then may you leave a casement of the great chamber window (where we play) open; and the moon may shine in at the casement.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>QUIN.</speaker>
<line>Ay; or else one must come in with a bush of thorns and a lantern, and say he comes to disfigure, or to present, the person of Moonshine. Then, there is another thing: we must have a wall in the great chamber; for Pyramus and Thisby (says the story) did talk through the chink of a wall.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SNOUT.</speaker>
<line>You can never bring in a wall. What say you, Bottom?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BOT.</speaker>
<line>Some man or other must present Wall; and let him have some plaster, or some loam, or some rough-cast about him, to signify wall; or let him hold his fingers thus, and through that cranny shall Pyramus and Thisby whisper.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>QUIN.</speaker>
<line>If that may be, then all is well. Come, sit down, every mother&#8217;s son, and rehearse your parts. Pyramus, you begin. When you have spoken your speech, enter into that brake; and so every one according to his cue.</line>

<line>Methinks, mistress, you should have little reason for that. And yet, to say the truth, reason and love keep little company together now-a-days. The more the pity that some honest neighbors will not make them friends. Nay, I can gleek upon occasion.</line>

<line>My mistress with a monster is in love.</line>
<line>Near to her close and consecrated bower,</line>
<line>While she was in her dull and sleeping hour,</line>
<line>A crew of patches, rude mechanicals,</line>
<line>That work for bread upon Athenian stalls,</line>
<line>Were met together to rehearse a play</line>
<line>Intended for great Theseus&#8217; nuptial day.</line>
<line>The shallowest thick-skin of that barren sort,</line>
<line>Who Pyramus presented, in their sport,</line>
<line>Forsook his scene, and ent&#8217;red in a brake;</line>
<line>When I did him at this advantage take,</line>
<line>An ass&#8217;s nole I fixed on his head.</line>
<line>Anon his Thisby must be answered,</line>
<line>And forth my mimic comes. When they him spy,</line>
<line>As wild geese that the creeping fowler eye,</line>
<line>Or russet-pated choughs, many in sort</line>
<line>(Rising and cawing at the gun&#8217;s report),</line>
<line>Sever themselves and madly sweep the sky,</line>
<line>So, at his sight, away his fellows fly;</line>
<line>And at our stamp, here o&#8217;er and o&#8217;er one falls;</line>
<line>He murder cries, and help from Athens calls.</line>
<line>Their sense thus weak, lost with their fears thus strong,</line>
<line>Made senseless things begin to do them wrong,</line>
<line>For briers and thorns at their apparel snatch;</line>
<line>Some sleeves, some hats, from yielders all things catch.</line>
<line>I led them on in this distracted fear,</line>
<line>And left sweet Pyramus translated there;</line>
<line>When in that moment (so it came to pass)</line>
<line>Titania wak&#8217;d, and straightway lov&#8217;d an ass.</line>

<line>And kill me too.</line>
<line>The sun was not so true unto the day</line>
<line>As he to me. Would he have stolen away</line>
<line>From sleeping Hermia? I&#8217;ll believe as soon</line>
<line>This whole earth may be bor&#8217;d, and that the moon</line>
<line>May through the centre creep, and so displease</line>
<line>Her brother&#8217;s noontide with th&#8217; Antipodes.</line>
<line>It cannot be but thou hast murd&#8217;red him;</line>
<line>So should a murderer look&#8212;so dead, so grim.</line>

<line>So should the murdered look, and so should I,</line>

<line>Yet you, the murderer, look as bright, as clear,</line>
<line>As yonder Venus in her glimmering sphere.</line>

<line>What&#8217;s this to my Lysander? Where is he?</line>
<line>Ah, good Demetrius, wilt thou give him me?</line>

<line>I had rather give his carcass to my hounds.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>HER.</speaker>
<line>Out, dog, out, cur! Thou driv&#8217;st me past the bounds</line>
<line>Of maiden&#8217;s patience. Hast thou slain him then?</line>
<line>Henceforth be never numb&#8217;red among men!</line>
<line>O, once tell true; tell true, even for my sake!</line>
<line>Durst thou have look&#8217;d upon him being awake?</line>
<line>And hast thou kill&#8217;d him sleeping? O brave touch!</line>
<line>Could not a worm, an adder, do so much?</line>
<line>An adder did it! For with doubler tongue</line>
<line>Than thine, thou serpent, never adder stung.</line>
</speech>

<line>You spend your passion on a mispris&#8217;d mood.</line>

<line>Lo! She is one of this confederacy.</line>
<line>Now I perceive, they have conjoin&#8217;d all three</line>

<line>Injurious Hermia, most ungrateful maid!</line>
<line>Have you conspir&#8217;d, have you with these contriv&#8217;d</line>
<line>To bait me with this foul derision?</line>
<line>Is all the counsel that we two have shar&#8217;d,</line>
<line>The sisters&#8217; vows, the hours that we have spent,</line>
<line>When we have chid the hasty-footed time</line>
<line>For parting us&#8212;O, is all forgot?</line>
<line>All school-days friendship, childhood innocence?</line>
<line>We, Hermia, like two artificial gods,</line>
<line>Have with our needles created both one flower,</line>
<line>Both on one sampler, sitting on one cushion,</line>
<line>Both warbling of one song, both in one key,</line>
<line>As if our hands, our sides, voices, and minds</line>
<line>Had been incorporate. So we grew together,</line>
<line>Like to a double cherry, seeming parted,</line>
<line>But yet an union in partition,</line>
<line>Two lovely berries moulded on one stem;</line>
<line>So with two seeming bodies, but one heart,</line>
<line>Two of the first, like coats in heraldry,</line>
<line>Due but to one, and crowned with one crest.</line>
<line>And will you rent our ancient love asunder,</line>
<line>To join with men in scorning your poor friend?</line>
<line>It is not friendly, &#8217;tis not maidenly.</line>
<line>Our sex, as well as I, may chide you for it,</line>
<line>Though I alone do feel the injury.</line>
</speech>

<speech>

<line>I am amazed at your passionate words.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>HEL.</speaker>
<line>Have you not set Lysander, as in scorn,</line>
<line>To follow me and praise my eyes and face?</line>
<line>And made your other love, Demetrius</line>
<line>(Who even but now did spurn me with his foot),</line>
<line>To call me goddess, nymph, divine and rare,</line>
<line>Precious, celestial? Wherefore speaks he this</line>
<line>To her he hates? And wherefore doth Lysander</line>
<line>Deny your love (so rich within his soul)</line>
<line>And tender me (forsooth) affection,</line>
<line>But by your setting on, by your consent?</line>
<line>What though I be not so in grace as you,</line>
<line>So hung upon with love, so fortunate</line>
<line>(But miserable most, to love unlov&#8217;d)?</line>
<line>This you should pity rather than despise.</line>

<line>Ay, do! Persever, counterfeit sad looks,</line>
<line>Make mouths upon me when I turn my back,</line>
<line>Wink each at other, hold the sweet jest up;</line>
<line>This sport, well carried, shall be chronicled.</line>
<line>If you have any pity, grace, or manners,</line>
<line>You would not make me such an argument.</line>

<line>With league whose date till death shall never end.</line>
<line>Whiles I in this affair do thee employ,</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll to my queen and beg her Indian boy;</line>

<line>My fairy lord, this must be done with haste,</line>
<line>For Night&#8217;s swift dragons cut the clouds full fast,</line>
<line>And yonder shines Aurora&#8217;s harbinger,</line>
<line>At whose approach, ghosts, wand&#8217;ring here and there,</line>
<line>Troop home to churchyards. Damned spirits all,</line>
<line>That in crossways and floods have burial,</line>
<line>Already to their wormy beds are gone.</line>
<line>For fear lest day should look their shames upon,</line>
<line>They willfully themselves exile from light,</line>

<speaker>OBE.</speaker>
<line>But we are spirits of another sort.</line>

<line>Welcome, good Robin. Seest thou this sweet sight?</line>
<line>Her dotage now I do begin to pity.</line>
<line>For meeting her of late behind the wood,</line>
<line>Seeking sweet favors for this hateful fool,</line>
<line>I did upbraid her, and fall out with her.</line>
<line>For she his hairy temples then had rounded</line>
<line>With coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers;</line>
<line>And that same dew which sometime on the buds</line>
<line>Was wont to swell like round and orient pearls,</line>
<line>Stood now within the pretty flouriets&#8217; eyes,</line>
<line>Like tears that did their own disgrace bewail.</line>
<line>When I had at my pleasure taunted her,</line>
<line>And she in mild terms begg&#8217;d my patience,</line>
<line>I then did ask of her her changeling child;</line>
<line>Which straight she gave me, and her fairy sent</line>
<line>To bear him to my bower in fairy land.</line>
<line>And now I have the boy, I will undo</line>
<line>This hateful imperfection of her eyes.</line>
<line>And, gentle Puck, take this transformed scalp</line>
<line>From off the head of this Athenian swain,</line>
<line>That he, awaking when the other do,</line>
<line>May all to Athens back again repair,</line>
<line>And think no more of this night&#8217;s accidents</line>
<line>But as the fierce vexation of a dream.</line>
<line>But first I will release the Fairy Queen.</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HIP.</speaker>
<line>I was with Hercules and Cadmus once,</line>
<line>When in a wood of Crete they bay&#8217;d the bear</line>
<line>With hounds of Sparta. Never did I hear</line>
<line>Such gallant chiding; for besides the groves,</line>
<line>The skies, the fountains, every region near</line>
<line>Seem all one mutual cry. I never heard</line>
<line>So musical a discord, such sweet thunder.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>THE.</speaker>
<line>My hounds are bred out of the Spartan kind;</line>
<line>So flew&#8217;d, so sanded; and their heads are hung</line>
<line>With ears that sweep away the morning dew;</line>
<line>Crook-knee&#8217;d, and dewlapp&#8217;d like Thessalian bulls;</line>
<line>Slow in pursuit; but match&#8217;d in mouth like bells,</line>
<line>Each under each. A cry more tuneable</line>
<line>Was never hollow&#8217;d to, nor cheer&#8217;d with horn,</line>
<line>In Crete, in Sparta, nor in Thessaly.</line>
<line>Judge when you hear. But soft! What nymphs are these?</line>

<line>But, as I think&#8212;for truly would I speak,</line>
<line>And now I do bethink me, so it is&#8212;</line>
<line>I came with Hermia hither. Our intent</line>
<line>Was to be gone from Athens, where we might,</line>
<line>Without the peril of the Athenian law&#8212;</line>

<speaker>EGE.</speaker>
<line>Enough, enough, my lord; you have enough.</line>

<line>Fair Helena in fancy following me.</line>
<line>But, my good lord, I wot not by what power</line>
<line>(But by some power it is), my love to Hermia</line>
<line>(Melted as the snow) seems to me now</line>
<line>As the remembrance of an idle gaud,</line>
<line>Which in my childhood I did dote upon;</line>
<line>And all the faith, the virtue of my heart,</line>
<line>The object and the pleasure of mine eye,</line>
<line>Is only Helena. To her, my lord,</line>
<line>Was I betrothed ere I saw Hermia;</line>
<line>But like a sickness did I loathe this food;</line>
<line>But, as in health, come to my natural taste,</line>
<line>Now I do wish it, love it, long for it,</line>
<line>And will forevermore be true to it.</line>

<speaker>THE.</speaker>
<line>Fair lovers, you are fortunately met;</line>
<line>Of this discourse we more will hear anon.</line>
<line>Egeus, I will overbear your will;</line>

<line>These couples shall eternally be knit.</line>
<line>And, for the morning now is something worn,</line>
<line>Our purpos&#8217;d hunting shall be set aside.</line>

<line>When my cue comes, call me, and I will answer. My next is, &#8220;Most fair Pyramus.&#8221; Heigh-ho! Peter Quince! Flute the bellows-mender! Snout the tinker! Starveling! God&#8217;s my life, stol&#8217;n hence, and left me asleep! I have had a most rare vision. I have had a dream, past the wit of man to say what dream it was. Man is but an ass, if he go about t&#8217; expound this dream. Methought I was&#8212;there is no man can tell what. Methought I was, and methought I had&#8212;but man is but a patch&#8217;d fool, if he will offer to say what methought I had. The eye of man hath not heard, the ear of man hath not seen, man&#8217;s hand is not able to taste, his tongue to conceive, nor his heart to report, what my dream was. I will get Peter Quince to write a ballet of this dream. It shall be call&#8217;d &#8220;Bottom&#8217;s Dream,&#8221; because it hath no bottom; and I will sing it in the latter end of a play, before the Duke. Peradventure, to make it the more gracious, I shall sing it at her death.</line>

<line>No, he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft man in Athens.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>QUIN.</speaker>
<line>Yea, and the best person too; and he is a very paramour for a sweet voice.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FLU.</speaker>
<line>You must say &#8220;paragon.&#8221; A paramour is (God bless us!) a thing of naught.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Snug the joiner.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>SNUG.</speaker>
<line>Masters, the Duke is coming from the temple, and there is two or three lords and ladies more married. If our sport had gone forward, we had all been made men.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FLU.</speaker>
<line>O sweet bully Bottom! Thus hath he lost sixpence a day during his life; he could not have scap&#8217;d sixpence a day. And the Duke had not given him sixpence a day for playing Pyramus, I&#8217;ll be hang&#8217;d. He would have deserv&#8217;d it. Sixpence a day in Pyramus, or nothing.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Bottom.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>BOT.</speaker>
<line>Where are these lads? Where are these hearts?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>QUIN.</speaker>
<line>Bottom! O most courageous day! O most happy hour!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BOT.</speaker>
<line>Masters, I am to discourse wonders; but ask me not what; for if I tell you, I am no true Athenian. I will tell you every thing, right as it fell out.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>QUIN.</speaker>
<line>Let us hear, sweet Bottom.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BOT.</speaker>
<line>Not a word of me. All that I will tell you is, that the Duke hath din&#8217;d. Get your apparel together, good strings to your beards, new ribands to your pumps; meet presently at the palace; every man look o&#8217;er his part; for the short and the long is, our play is preferr&#8217;d. In any case, let Thisby have clean linen; and let not him that plays the lion pare his nails, for they shall hang out for the lion&#8217;s claws. And, most dear actors, eat no onions nor garlic, for we are to utter sweet breath; and I do not doubt but to hear them say, it is a sweet comedy. No more words. Away, go, away!</line>

<stagedir>Enter Theseus, Hippolyta, and Philostrate, Lords, and Attendants.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>HIP.</speaker>
<line>&#8217;Tis strange, my Theseus, that these lovers speak of.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>THE.</speaker>
<line>More strange than true. I never may believe</line>
<line>These antic fables, nor these fairy toys.</line>
<line>Lovers and madmen have such seething brains,</line>
<line>Such shaping fantasies, that apprehend</line>
<line>More than cool reason ever comprehends.</line>
<line>The lunatic, the lover, and the poet</line>
<line>Are of imagination all compact.</line>
<line>One sees more devils than vast hell can hold;</line>
<line>That is the madman. The lover, all as frantic,</line>
<line>Sees Helen&#8217;s beauty in a brow of Egypt.</line>
<line>The poet&#8217;s eye, in a fine frenzy rolling,</line>
<line>Doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven;</line>
<line>And as imagination bodies forth</line>
<line>The forms of things unknown, the poet&#8217;s pen</line>
<line>Turns them to shapes, and gives to aery nothing</line>
<line>A local habitation and a name.</line>
<line>Such tricks hath strong imagination,</line>
<line>That if it would but apprehend some joy,</line>
<line>It comprehends some bringer of that joy;</line>
<line>Or in the night, imagining some fear,</line>
<line>How easy is a bush suppos&#8217;d a bear!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HIP.</speaker>
<line>But all the story of the night told over,</line>
<line>And all their minds transfigur&#8217;d so together,</line>
<line>More witnesseth than fancy&#8217;s images,</line>
<line>And grows to something of great constancy;</line>
<line>But howsoever, strange and admirable.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter lovers, Lysander, Demetrius, Hermia, and Helena.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>THE.</speaker>
<line>Here come the lovers, full of joy and mirth.</line>
<line>Joy, gentle friends, joy and fresh days of love</line>
<line>Accompany your hearts!</line>

<line offset="5">More than to us</line>
<line>Wait in your royal walks, your board, your bed!</line>

<speech>
<speaker>THE.</speaker>
<line>Come now; what masques, what dances shall we have,</line>
<line>To wear away this long age of three hours</line>
<line>Between our after-supper and bed-time?</line>
<line>Where is our usual manager of mirth?</line>
<line>What revels are in hand? Is there no play</line>
<line>To ease the anguish of a torturing hour?</line>
<line>Call Philostrate.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PHIL.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Here, mighty Theseus.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>THE.</speaker>
<line>Say, what abridgment have you for this evening?</line>
<line>What masque? What music? How shall we beguile</line>
<line>The lazy time, if not with some delight?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PHIL.</speaker>
<line>There is a brief how many sports are ripe.</line>
<line>Make choice of which your Highness will see first.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Giving a paper.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>THE.</speaker>
<stagedir>Reads.</stagedir>
<line><RECITE>&#8220;The battle with the Centaurs, to be sung</RECITE></line>
<line><RECITE>By an Athenian eunuch to the harp.&#8221;</RECITE></line>
<line>We&#8217;ll none of that: that have I told my love,</line>
<line>In glory of my kinsman Hercules.</line>
<line><RECITE>&#8220;The riot of the tipsy Bacchanals,</RECITE></line>
<line><RECITE>Tearing the Thracian singer in their rage.&#8221;</RECITE></line>
<line>That is an old device; and it was play&#8217;d</line>
<line>When I from Thebes came last a conqueror.</line>
<line><RECITE>&#8220;The thrice three Muses mourning for the death</RECITE></line>
<line><RECITE>Of Learning, late deceas&#8217;d in beggary.&#8221;</RECITE></line>
<line>That is some satire, keen and critical,</line>
<line>Not sorting with a nuptial ceremony.</line>
<line><RECITE>&#8220;A tedious brief scene of young Pyramus</RECITE></line>
<line><RECITE>And his love Thisby; very tragical mirth.&#8221;</RECITE></line>
<line>Merry and tragical? Tedious and brief?</line>
<line>That is hot ice and wondrous strange snow.</line>
<line>How shall we find the concord of this discord?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PHIL.</speaker>
<line>A play there is, my lord, some ten words long,</line>
<line>Which is as brief as I have known a play;</line>
<line>But by ten words, my lord, it is too long,</line>
<line>Which makes it tedious; for in all the play</line>
<line>There is not one word apt, one player fitted.</line>
<line>And tragical, my noble lord, it is;</line>
<line>For Pyramus therein doth kill himself;</line>
<line>Which when I saw rehears&#8217;d, I must confess,</line>
<line>Made mine eyes water; but more merry tears</line>
<line>The passion of loud laughter never shed.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>THE.</speaker>
<line>What are they that do play it?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PHIL.</speaker>
<line>Hard-handed men that work in Athens here,</line>
<line>Which never labor&#8217;d in their minds till now;</line>
<line>And now have toiled their unbreathed memories</line>
<line>With this same play, against your nuptial.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>THE.</speaker>
<line>And we will hear it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PHIL.</speaker>
<line offset="4">No, my noble lord,</line>
<line>It is not for you. I have heard it over,</line>
<line>And it is nothing, nothing in the world;</line>
<line>Unless you can find sport in their intents,</line>
<line>Extremely stretch&#8217;d, and conn&#8217;d with cruel pain,</line>
<line>To do you service.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>THE.</speaker>
<line offset="4">I will hear that play;</line>
<line>For never any thing can be amiss,</line>
<line>When simpleness and duty tender it.</line>
<line>Go bring them in; and take your places, ladies.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit Philostrate.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>HIP.</speaker>
<line>I love not to see wretchedness o&#8217;ercharged,</line>
<line>And duty in his service perishing.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>THE.</speaker>
<line>Why, gentle sweet, you shall see no such thing.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HIP.</speaker>
<line>He says they can do nothing in this kind.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>THE.</speaker>
<line>The kinder we, to give them thanks for nothing.</line>
<line>Our sport shall be to take what they mistake;</line>
<line>And what poor duty cannot do, noble respect</line>
<line>Takes it in might, not merit.</line>
<line>Where I have come, great clerks have purposed</line>
<line>To greet me with premeditated welcomes;</line>
<line>Where I have seen them shiver and look pale,</line>
<line>Make periods in the midst of sentences,</line>
<line>Throttle their practic&#8217;d accent in their fears,</line>
<line>And in conclusion dumbly have broke off,</line>
<line>Not paying me a welcome. Trust me, sweet,</line>
<line>Out of this silence yet I pick&#8217;d a welcome;</line>
<line>And in the modesty of fearful duty</line>
<line>I read as much as from the rattling tongue</line>
<line>Of saucy and audacious eloquence.</line>
<line>Love, therefore, and tongue-tied simplicity</line>
<line>In least speak most, to my capacity.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Philostrate.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>PHIL.</speaker>
<line>So please your Grace, the Prologue is address&#8217;d.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>THE.</speaker>
<line>Let him approach.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Flourish trumpet.</stagedir>

<stagedir>Enter Quince for the Prologue.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>PRO.</speaker>
<line>If we offend, it is with our good will.</line>
<line>That you should think, we come not to offend,</line>
<line>But with good will. To show our simple skill,</line>
<line>That is the true beginning of our end.</line>
<line>Consider then, we come but in despite.</line>
<line>We do not come, as minding to content you,</line>
<line>Our true intent is. All for your delight</line>
<line>We are not here. That you should here repent you,</line>
<line>The actors are at hand; and, by their show,</line>
<line>You shall know all, that you are like to know.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>THE.</speaker>
<line>This fellow doth not stand upon points.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LYS.</speaker>
<line>He hath rid his prologue like a rough colt; he knows not the stop. A good moral, my lord: it is not enough to speak, but to speak true.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HIP.</speaker>
<line>Indeed he hath play&#8217;d on this prologue like a child on a recorder&#8212;a sound, but not in government.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>THE.</speaker>
<line>His speech was like a tangled chain; nothing impair&#8217;d, but all disorder&#8217;d. Who is next?</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter with a Trumpet before them Pyramus and Thisby and Wall and Moonshine and Lion.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>PRO.</speaker>
<line>Gentles, perchance you wonder at this show;</line>
<line>But wonder on till truth make all things plain.</line>
<line>This man is Pyramus, if you would know;</line>
<line>This beauteous lady Thisby is certain.</line>
<line>This man, with lime and rough-cast, doth present</line>
<line>Wall, that vile Wall, which did these lovers sunder;</line>
<line>And through Wall&#8217;s chink, poor souls, they are content</line>
<line>To whisper. At the which let no man wonder.</line>
<line>This man, with lantern, dog, and bush of thorn,</line>
<line>Presenteth Moonshine; for if you will know,</line>
<line>By moonshine did these lovers think no scorn</line>
<line>To meet at Ninus&#8217; tomb, there, there to woo.</line>
<line>This grisly beast, which Lion hight by name,</line>
<line>The trusty Thisby, coming first by night,</line>
<line>Did scare away, or rather did affright;</line>
<line>And as she fled, her mantle she did fall,</line>
<line>Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain.</line>
<line>Anon comes Pyramus, sweet youth and tall,</line>
<line>And finds his trusty Thisby&#8217;s mantle slain;</line>
<line>Whereat, with blade, with bloody blameful blade,</line>
<line>He bravely broach&#8217;d his boiling bloody breast;</line>
<line>And Thisby, tarrying in mulberry shade,</line>
<line>His dagger drew, and died. For all the rest,</line>
<line>Let Lion, Moonshine, Wall, and lovers twain</line>
<line>At large discourse, while here they do remain.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit with Pyramus, Thisby, Lion, and Moonshine.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>THE.</speaker>
<line>I wonder if the lion be to speak.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DEM.</speaker>
<line>No wonder, my lord; one lion may, when many asses do.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WALL.</speaker>
<line>In this same enterlude it doth befall</line>
<line>That I, one Snout by name, present a wall;</line>
<line>And such a wall, as I would have you think,</line>
<line>That had in it a crannied hole or chink,</line>
<line>Through which the lovers, Pyramus and Thisby,</line>
<line>Did whisper often, very secretly.</line>
<line>This loam, this rough-cast, and this stone doth show</line>
<line>That I am that same wall; the truth is so;</line>
<line>And this the cranny is, right and sinister,</line>
<line>Through which the fearful lovers are to whisper.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>THE.</speaker>
<line>Would you desire lime and hair to speak better?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DEM.</speaker>
<line>It is the wittiest partition that ever I heard discourse, my lord.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Pyramus.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>THE.</speaker>
<line>Pyramus draws near the wall. Silence!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PYR.</speaker>
<line>O grim-look&#8217;d night! O night with hue so black!</line>
<line>O night, which ever art when day is not!</line>
<line>O night, O night! Alack, alack, alack,</line>
<line>I fear my Thisby&#8217;s promise is forgot!</line>
<line>And thou, O wall, O sweet, O lovely wall,</line>
<line>That stand&#8217;st between her father&#8217;s ground and mine!</line>
<line>Thou wall, O wall, O sweet and lovely wall,</line>
<line>Show me thy chink, to blink through with mine eyne!</line>

<stagedir>Wall holds up his fingers.</stagedir>
<line>Thanks, courteous wall; Jove shield thee well for this!</line>
<line>But what see I? No Thisby do I see.</line>
<line>O wicked wall, through whom I see no bliss!</line>
<line>Curs&#8217;d be thy stones for thus deceiving me!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>THE.</speaker>
<line>The wall methinks, being sensible, should curse again.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PYR.</speaker>
<line>No, in truth, sir, he should not. &#8220;Deceiving me&#8221; is Thisby&#8217;s cue. She is to enter now, and I am to spy her through the wall. You shall see it will fall pat as I told you. Yonder she comes.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Thisby.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>THIS.</speaker>
<line>O wall, full often hast thou heard my moans,</line>
<line>For parting my fair Pyramus and me!</line>
<line>My cherry lips have often kiss&#8217;d thy stones,</line>
<line>Thy stones with lime and hair knit up in thee.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PYR.</speaker>
<line>I see a voice! Now will I to the chink,</line>
<line>To spy and I can hear my Thisby&#8217;s face.</line>
<line>Thisby!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>THIS.</speaker>
<line>My love thou art, my love I think.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PYR.</speaker>
<line>Think what thou wilt, I am thy lover&#8217;s grace;</line>
<line>And, like Limander, am I trusty still.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>THIS.</speaker>
<line>And I, like Helen, till the Fates me kill.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PYR.</speaker>
<line>Not Shafalus to Procrus was so true.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>THIS.</speaker>
<line>As Shafalus to Procrus, I to you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PYR.</speaker>
<line>O, kiss me through the hole of this vild wall!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>THIS.</speaker>
<line>I kiss the wall&#8217;s hole, not your lips at all.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PYR.</speaker>
<line>Wilt thou at Ninny&#8217;s tomb meet me straightway?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>THIS.</speaker>
<line>&#8217;Tide life, &#8217;tide death, I come without delay.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exeunt Pyramus and Thisby.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>WALL.</speaker>
<line>Thus have I, Wall, my part discharged so;</line>
<line>And being done, thus Wall away doth go.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>THE.</speaker>
<line>Now is the moon used between the two neighbors.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DEM.</speaker>
<line>No remedy, my lord, when walls are so willful to hear without warning.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HIP.</speaker>
<line>This is the silliest stuff that ever I heard.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>THE.</speaker>
<line>The best in this kind are but shadows; and the worst are no worse, if imagination amend them.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HIP.</speaker>
<line>It must be your imagination then, and not theirs.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>THE.</speaker>
<line>If we imagine no worse of them than they of themselves, they may pass for excellent men. Here come two noble beasts in, a man and a lion.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Lion and Moonshine.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>LION.</speaker>
<line>You, ladies, you, whose gentle hearts do fear</line>
<line>The smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor,</line>
<line>May now, perchance, both quake and tremble here,</line>
<line>When lion rough in wildest rage doth roar.</line>
<line>Then know that I as Snug the joiner am</line>
<line>A lion fell, nor else no lion&#8217;s dam,</line>
<line>For, if I should, as lion, come in strife</line>
<line>Into this place, &#8217;twere pity on my life.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>THE.</speaker>
<line>A very gentle beast, and of a good conscience.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DEM.</speaker>
<line>The very best at a beast, my lord, that e&#8217;er I saw.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LYS.</speaker>
<line>This lion is a very fox for his valor.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>THE.</speaker>
<line>True; and a goose for his discretion.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DEM.</speaker>
<line>Not so, my lord; for his valor cannot carry his discretion, and the fox carries the goose.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>THE.</speaker>
<line>His discretion, I am sure, cannot carry his valor; for the goose carries not the fox. It is well; leave it to his discretion, and let us listen to the Moon.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MOON.</speaker>
<line>This lanthorn doth the horned moon present&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DEM.</speaker>
<line>He should have worn the horns on his head.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>THE.</speaker>
<line>He is no crescent, and his horns are invisible within the circumference.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MOON.</speaker>
<line>This lanthorn doth the horned moon present;</line>
<line>Myself the man i&#8217; th&#8217; moon do seem to be.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>THE.</speaker>
<line>This is the greatest error of all the rest. The man should be put into the lanthorn. How is it else the man i&#8217; th&#8217; moon?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DEM.</speaker>
<line>He dares not come there for the candle; for, you see, it is already in snuff.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HIP.</speaker>
<line>I am a-weary of this moon. Would he would change!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>THE.</speaker>
<line>It appears, by his small light of discretion, that he is in the wane; but yet in courtesy, in all reason, we must stay the time.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LYS.</speaker>
<line>Proceed, Moon.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MOON.</speaker>
<line>All that I have to say is to tell you that the lanthorn is the moon, I the man i&#8217; th&#8217; moon, this thorn-bush my thorn-bush, and this dog my dog.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DEM.</speaker>
<line>Why, all these should be in the lanthorn; for all these are in the moon. But silence! Here comes Thisby.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Thisby.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>THIS.</speaker>
<line>This is old Ninny&#8217;s tomb. Where is my love?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LION.</speaker>
<line>O!</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>The Lion roars. Thisby runs off.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>DEM.</speaker>
<line>Well roar&#8217;d, Lion.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>THE.</speaker>
<line>Well run, Thisby.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HIP.</speaker>
<line>Well shone, Moon. Truly, the moon shines with a good grace.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>The Lion shakes Thisby&#8217;s mantle.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>THE.</speaker>
<line>Well mous&#8217;d, Lion.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Pyramus.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>DEM.</speaker>
<line>And then came Pyramus.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit Lion.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>LYS.</speaker>
<line>And so the lion vanish&#8217;d.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PYR.</speaker>
<line>Sweet Moon, I thank thee for thy sunny beams;</line>
<line>I thank thee, Moon, for shining now so bright;</line>
<line>For by thy gracious, golden, glittering gleams,</line>
<line>I trust to take of truest Thisby sight.</line>
<line><RECITE>But stay! O spite!</RECITE></line>
<line><RECITE>But mark, poor knight,</RECITE></line>
<line><RECITE>What dreadful dole is here!</RECITE></line>
<line><RECITE>Eyes, do you see?</RECITE></line>
<line><RECITE>How can it be?</RECITE></line>
<line><RECITE>O dainty duck! O dear!</RECITE></line>
<line><RECITE>Thy mantle good,</RECITE></line>
<line><RECITE>What, stain&#8217;d with blood?</RECITE></line>
<line><RECITE>Approach, ye Furies fell!</RECITE></line>
<line><RECITE>O Fates, come, come,</RECITE></line>
<line><RECITE>Cut thread and thrum,</RECITE></line>
<line><RECITE>Quail, crush, conclude, and quell!</RECITE></line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>THE.</speaker>
<line>This passion, and the death of a dear friend, would go near to make a man look sad.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HIP.</speaker>
<line>Beshrew my heart, but I pity the man.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PYR.</speaker>
<line>O, wherefore, Nature, didst thou lions frame?</line>
<line>Since lion vild hath here deflow&#8217;r&#8217;d my dear;</line>

<line><RECITE>Come, tears, confound,</RECITE></line>

<line><RECITE>The pap of Pyramus;</RECITE></line>
<line><RECITE>Ay, that left pap,</RECITE></line>
<line><RECITE>Where heart doth hop.</RECITE></line>

<stagedir>Stabs himself.</stagedir>
<line><RECITE>Thus die I, thus, thus, thus.</RECITE></line>
<line><RECITE>Now am I dead,</RECITE></line>
<line><RECITE>Now am I fled;</RECITE></line>
<line><RECITE>My soul is in the sky.</RECITE></line>
<line><RECITE>Tongue, lose thy light,</RECITE></line>
<line><RECITE>Moon, take thy flight,</RECITE></line>

<stagedir>Exit Moonshine.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>DEM.</speaker>
<line>No die, but an ace, for him; for he is but one.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LYS.</speaker>
<line>Less than an ace, man; for he is dead, he is nothing.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>THE.</speaker>
<line>With the help of a surgeon he might yet recover, and yet prove an ass.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HIP.</speaker>
<line>How chance Moonshine is gone before Thisby comes back and finds her lover?</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Thisby.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>THE.</speaker>
<line>She will find him by starlight. Here she comes, and her passion ends the play.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HIP.</speaker>
<line>Methinks she should not use a long one for such a Pyramus. I hope she will be brief.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DEM.</speaker>
<line>A mote will turn the balance, which Pyramus, which Thisby, is the better: he for a man. God warr&#8217;nt us; she for a woman. God bless us.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LYS.</speaker>
<line>She hath spied him already with those sweet eyes.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DEM.</speaker>
<line>And thus she means, videlicet&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>THIS.</speaker>
<line><RECITE>Asleep, my love?</RECITE></line>
<line><RECITE>What, dead, my dove?</RECITE></line>
<line><RECITE>O Pyramus, arise!</RECITE></line>
<line><RECITE>Speak, speak! Quite dumb?</RECITE></line>
<line><RECITE>Dead, dead? A tomb</RECITE></line>
<line><RECITE>Must cover thy sweet eyes.</RECITE></line>
<line><RECITE>These lily lips,</RECITE></line>
<line><RECITE>This cherry nose,</RECITE></line>
<line><RECITE>These yellow cowslip cheeks,</RECITE></line>
<line><RECITE>Are gone, are gone!</RECITE></line>
<line><RECITE>Lovers, make moan;</RECITE></line>
<line><RECITE>His eyes were green as leeks.</RECITE></line>
<line><RECITE>O Sisters Three,</RECITE></line>
<line><RECITE>Come, come to me,</RECITE></line>

<line><RECITE>Come, trusty sword,</RECITE></line>

<stagedir>Dies.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>THE.</speaker>
<line>Moonshine and Lion are left to bury the dead.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DEM.</speaker>
<line>Ay, and Wall too.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BOT.</speaker>
<stagedir>Starting up.</stagedir>
<line>No, I assure you, the wall is down that parted their fathers. Will it please you to see the epilogue, or to hear a Bergomask dance between two of our company?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>THE.</speaker>
<line>No epilogue, I pray you; for your play needs no excuse. Never excuse; for when the players are all dead, there need none to be blam&#8217;d. Marry, if he that writ it had play&#8217;d Pyramus, and hang&#8217;d himself in Thisby&#8217;s garter, it would have been a fine tragedy; and so it is, truly, and very notably discharg&#8217;d. But come, your Bergomask; let your epilogue alone.</line>

<stagedir>A dance.</stagedir>
<line>The iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve.</line>
<line>Lovers, to bed, &#8217;tis almost fairy time.</line>
<line>I fear we shall outsleep the coming morn</line>
<line>As much as we this night have overwatch&#8217;d.</line>
<line>This palpable-gross play hath well beguil&#8217;d</line>
<line>The heavy gait of night. Sweet friends, to bed.</line>
<line>A fortnight hold we this solemnity,</line>
<line>In nightly revels and new jollity.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exeunt.</stagedir>

<stagedir>Enter Puck.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>PUCK.</speaker>
<line type="lyric">Now the hungry lion roars,</line>
<line type="lyric">And the wolf behowls the moon;</line>
<line type="lyric">Whilst the heavy ploughman snores,</line>
<line type="lyric">All with weary task foredone.</line>
<line type="lyric">Now the wasted brands do glow,</line>
<line type="lyric">Whilst the screech owl, screeching loud,</line>
<line type="lyric">Puts the wretch that lies in woe</line>
<line type="lyric">In remembrance of a shroud.</line>
<line type="lyric">Now it is the time of night</line>
<line type="lyric">That the graves, all gaping wide,</line>
<line type="lyric">Every one lets forth his sprite,</line>
<line type="lyric">In the church-way paths to glide.</line>
<line type="lyric">And we fairies, that do run</line>
<line type="lyric">By the triple Hecat&#8217;s team</line>
<line type="lyric">From the presence of the sun,</line>
<line type="lyric">Following darkness like a dream,</line>
<line type="lyric">Now are frolic. Not a mouse</line>
<line type="lyric">Shall disturb this hallowed house.</line>
<line type="lyric">I am sent with broom before,</line>
<line type="lyric">To sweep the dust behind the door.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter King and Queen of Fairies, Oberon and Titania, with all their Train.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>OBE.</speaker>
<line type="lyric">Through the house give glimmering light</line>
<line type="lyric">By the dead and drowsy fire,</line>
<line type="lyric">Every elf and fairy sprite</line>
<line type="lyric">Hop as light as bird from brier,</line>
<line type="lyric">And this ditty, after me,</line>
<line type="lyric">Sing, and dance it trippingly.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TITA.</speaker>
<line>First, rehearse your song by rote,</line>
<line>To each word a warbling note.</line>
<line>Hand in hand, with fairy grace,</line>
<line>Will we sing, and bless this place.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Song and dance.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>OBE.</speaker>
<line type="lyric">Now, until the break of day,</line>
<line type="lyric">Through this house each fairy stray.</line>
<line type="lyric">To the best bride-bed will we,</line>
<line type="lyric">Which by us shall blessed be;</line>
<line type="lyric">And the issue, there create,</line>
<line type="lyric">Ever shall be fortunate.</line>
<line type="lyric">So shall all the couples three</line>
<line type="lyric">Ever true in loving be;</line>
<line type="lyric">And the blots of Nature&#8217;s hand</line>
<line type="lyric">Shall not in their issue stand;</line>
<line type="lyric">Never mole, hare-lip, nor scar,</line>
<line type="lyric">Nor mark prodigious, such as are</line>
<line type="lyric">Despised in nativity,</line>
<line type="lyric">Shall upon their children be.</line>
<line type="lyric">With this field-dew consecrate,</line>
<line type="lyric">Every fairy take his gait,</line>
<line type="lyric">And each several chamber bless,</line>
<line type="lyric">Through this palace, with sweet peace,</line>
<line type="lyric">And the owner of it blest</line>
<line type="lyric">Ever shall in safety rest.</line>
<line type="lyric">Trip away; make no stay;</line>
<line type="lyric">Meet me all by break of day.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exeunt Oberon, Titania, and Train.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>PUCK.</speaker>
<line type="lyric">If we shadows have offended,</line>
<line type="lyric">Think but this, and all is mended,</line>
<line type="lyric">That you have but slumb&#8217;red here</line>
<line type="lyric">While these visions did appear.</line>
<line type="lyric">And this weak and idle theme,</line>
<line type="lyric">No more yielding but a dream,</line>
<line type="lyric">Gentles, do not reprehend.</line>
<line type="lyric">If you pardon, we will mend.</line>
<line type="lyric">And, as I am an honest Puck,</line>
<line type="lyric">If we have unearned luck</line>
<line type="lyric">Now to scape the serpent&#8217;s tongue,</line>
<line type="lyric">We will make amends ere long;</line>
<line type="lyric">Else the Puck a liar call.</line>
<line type="lyric">So, good night unto you all.</line>
<line type="lyric">Give me your hands, if we be friends,</line>
<line type="lyric">And Robin shall restore amends.</line>
