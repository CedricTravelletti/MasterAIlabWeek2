<SCENELOCATION>Athens. The palace of Theseus.</SCENELOCATION>
<SCENEPERSONAE>(Theseus, Hippolyta, Philostrate, Egeus, Hermia, Lysander, Demetrius, Helena)</SCENEPERSONAE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Theseus, Hippolyta, Philostrate, with others.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, fair Hippolyta, our nuptial hour</LINE>
<LINE>Draws on apace. Four happy days bring in</LINE>
<LINE>Another moon; but O, methinks, how slow</LINE>
<LINE>This old moon wanes! She lingers my desires,</LINE>
<LINE>Like to a step-dame, or a dowager,</LINE>
<LINE>Long withering out a young man&#8217;s revenue.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HIP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Four days will quickly steep themselves in night;</LINE>
<LINE>Four nights will quickly dream away the time;</LINE>
<LINE>And then the moon, like to a silver bow</LINE>
<LINE>New bent in heaven, shall behold the night</LINE>
<LINE>Of our solemnities.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Go, Philostrate,</LINE>
<LINE>Stir up the Athenian youth to merriments,</LINE>
<LINE>Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth,</LINE>
<LINE>Turn melancholy forth to funerals:</LINE>
<LINE>The pale companion is not for our pomp.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exit Philostrate.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Hippolyta, I woo&#8217;d thee with my sword,</LINE>
<LINE>And won thy love doing thee injuries;</LINE>
<LINE>But I will wed thee in another key,</LINE>
<LINE>With pomp, with triumph, and with revelling.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Egeus and his daughter Hermia and Lysander and Demetrius.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EGE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Happy be Theseus, our renowned Duke!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thanks, good Egeus. What&#8217;s the news with thee?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EGE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Full of vexation come I, with complaint</LINE>
<LINE>Against my child, my daughter Hermia.</LINE>
<LINE>Stand forth, Demetrius. My noble lord,</LINE>
<LINE>This man hath my consent to marry her.</LINE>
<LINE>Stand forth, Lysander. And, my gracious Duke,</LINE>
<LINE>This man hath bewitch&#8217;d the bosom of my child.</LINE>
<LINE>Thou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes,</LINE>
<LINE>And interchang&#8217;d love-tokens with my child;</LINE>
<LINE>Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung</LINE>
<LINE>With faining voice verses of faining love,</LINE>
<LINE>And stol&#8217;n the impression of her fantasy</LINE>
<LINE>With bracelets of thy hair, rings, gawds, conceits,</LINE>
<LINE>Knacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats&#8212;messengers</LINE>
<LINE>Of strong prevailment in unhardened youth.</LINE>
<LINE>With cunning hast thou filch&#8217;d my daughter&#8217;s heart,</LINE>
<LINE>Turn&#8217;d her obedience (which is due to me)</LINE>
<LINE>To stubborn harshness. And, my gracious Duke,</LINE>
<LINE>Be it so she will not here before your Grace</LINE>
<LINE>Consent to marry with Demetrius,</LINE>
<LINE>I beg the ancient privilege of Athens:</LINE>
<LINE>As she is mine, I may dispose of her;</LINE>
<LINE>Which shall be either to this gentleman,</LINE>
<LINE>Or to her death, according to our law</LINE>
<LINE>Immediately provided in that case.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What say you, Hermia? Be advis&#8217;d, fair maid.</LINE>
<LINE>To you your father should be as a god;</LINE>
<LINE>One that compos&#8217;d your beauties; yea, and one</LINE>
<LINE>To whom you are but as a form in wax,</LINE>
<LINE>By him imprinted, and within his power,</LINE>
<LINE>To leave the figure, or disfigure it.</LINE>
<LINE>Demetrius is a worthy gentleman.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So is Lysander.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="3">In himself he is;</LINE>
<LINE>But in this kind, wanting your father&#8217;s voice,</LINE>
<LINE>The other must be held the worthier.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would my father look&#8217;d but with my eyes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do entreat your Grace to pardon me.</LINE>
<LINE>I know not by what power I am made bold,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor how it may concern my modesty,</LINE>
<LINE>In such a presence here to plead my thoughts;</LINE>
<LINE>But I beseech your Grace that I may know</LINE>
<LINE>The worst that may befall me in this case,</LINE>
<LINE>If I refuse to wed Demetrius.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Either to die the death, or to abjure</LINE>
<LINE>Forever the society of men.</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore, fair Hermia, question your desires,</LINE>
<LINE>Know of your youth, examine well your blood,</LINE>
<LINE>Whether (if you yield not to your father&#8217;s choice)</LINE>
<LINE>You can endure the livery of a nun,</LINE>
<LINE>For aye to be in shady cloister mew&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>To live a barren sister all your life,</LINE>
<LINE>Chaunting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon.</LINE>
<LINE>Thrice blessed they that master so their blood</LINE>
<LINE>To undergo such maiden pilgrimage;</LINE>
<LINE>But earthlier happy is the rose distill&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Than that which withering on the virgin thorn</LINE>
<LINE>Grows, lives, and dies in single blessedness.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So will I grow, so live, so die, my lord,</LINE>
<LINE>Ere I will yield my virgin patent up</LINE>
<LINE>Unto his lordship, whose unwished yoke</LINE>
<LINE>My soul consents not to give sovereignty.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Take time to pause, and by the next new moon&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>The sealing-day betwixt my love and me</LINE>
<LINE>For everlasting bond of fellowship&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Upon that day either prepare to die</LINE>
<LINE>For disobedience to your father&#8217;s will,</LINE>
<LINE>Or else to wed Demetrius, as he would,</LINE>
<LINE>Or on Diana&#8217;s altar to protest</LINE>
<LINE>For aye austerity and single life.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DEM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Relent, sweet Hermia, and, Lysander, yield</LINE>
<LINE>Thy crazed title to my certain right.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LYS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You have her father&#8217;s love, Demetrius,</LINE>
<LINE>Let me have Hermia&#8217;s; do you marry him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EGE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Scornful Lysander, true, he hath my love;</LINE>
<LINE>And what is mine, my love shall render him.</LINE>
<LINE>And she is mine, and all my right of her</LINE>
<LINE>I do estate unto Demetrius.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LYS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am, my lord, as well deriv&#8217;d as he,</LINE>
<LINE>As well possess&#8217;d; my love is more than his;</LINE>
<LINE>My fortunes every way as fairly rank&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>(If not with vantage) as Demetrius&#8217;;</LINE>
<LINE>And (which is more than all these boasts can be)</LINE>
<LINE>I am belov&#8217;d of beauteous Hermia.</LINE>
<LINE>Why should not I then prosecute my right?</LINE>
<LINE>Demetrius, I&#8217;ll avouch it to his head,</LINE>
<LINE>Made love to Nedar&#8217;s daughter, Helena,</LINE>
<LINE>And won her soul; and she, sweet lady, dotes,</LINE>
<LINE>Devoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry,</LINE>
<LINE>Upon this spotted and inconstant man.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I must confess that I have heard so much,</LINE>
<LINE>And with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof;</LINE>
<LINE>But, being over-full of self-affairs,</LINE>
<LINE>My mind did lose it. But, Demetrius, come,</LINE>
<LINE>And come, Egeus, you shall go with me;</LINE>
<LINE>I have some private schooling for you both.</LINE>
<LINE>For you, fair Hermia, look you arm yourself</LINE>
<LINE>To fit your fancies to your father&#8217;s will;</LINE>
<LINE>Or else the law of Athens yields you up</LINE>
<LINE>(Which by no means we may extenuate)</LINE>
<LINE>To death, or to a vow of single life.</LINE>
<LINE>Come, my Hippolyta; what cheer, my love?</LINE>
<LINE>Demetrius and Egeus, go along;</LINE>
<LINE>I must employ you in some business</LINE>
<LINE>Against our nuptial, and confer with you</LINE>
<LINE>Of something nearly that concerns yourselves.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EGE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>With duty and desire we follow you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt. Manent Lysander and Hermia.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LYS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How now, my love? Why is your cheek so pale?</LINE>
<LINE>How chance the roses there do fade so fast?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Belike for want of rain; which I could well</LINE>
<LINE>Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LYS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay me! For aught that I could ever read,</LINE>
<LINE>Could ever hear by tale or history,</LINE>
<LINE>The course of true love never did run smooth;</LINE>
<LINE>But either it was different in blood&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O cross! Too high to be enthrall&#8217;d to low.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LYS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Or else misgraffed in respect of years&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O spite! Too old to be engag&#8217;d to young.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LYS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Or else it stood upon the choice of friends&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O hell, to choose love by another&#8217;s eyes!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LYS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Or if there were a sympathy in choice,</LINE>
<LINE>War, death, or sickness did lay siege to it,</LINE>
<LINE>Making it momentany as a sound,</LINE>
<LINE>Swift as a shadow, short as any dream,</LINE>
<LINE>Brief as the lightning in the collied night,</LINE>
<LINE>That, in a spleen, unfolds both heaven and earth;</LINE>
<LINE>And ere a man hath power to say &#8220;Behold!&#8221;</LINE>
<LINE>The jaws of darkness do devour it up:</LINE>
<LINE>So quick bright things come to confusion.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If then true lovers have been ever cross&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>It stands as an edict in destiny.</LINE>
<LINE>Then let us teach our trial patience,</LINE>
<LINE>Because it is a customary cross,</LINE>
<LINE>As due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs,</LINE>
<LINE>Wishes and tears, poor fancy&#8217;s followers.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LYS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A good persuasion; therefore hear me, Hermia:</LINE>
<LINE>I have a widow aunt, a dowager,</LINE>
<LINE>Of great revenue, and she hath no child.</LINE>
<LINE>From Athens is her house remote seven leagues;</LINE>
<LINE>And she respects me as her only son.</LINE>
<LINE>There, gentle Hermia, may I marry thee;</LINE>
<LINE>And to that place the sharp Athenian law</LINE>
<LINE>Cannot pursue us. If thou lovest me, then</LINE>
<LINE>Steal forth thy father&#8217;s house tomorrow night;</LINE>
<LINE>And in the wood, a league without the town</LINE>
<LINE>(Where I did meet thee once with Helena</LINE>
<LINE>To do observance to a morn of May),</LINE>
<LINE>There will I stay for thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">My good Lysander,</LINE>
<LINE>I swear to thee, by Cupid&#8217;s strongest bow,</LINE>
<LINE>By his best arrow with the golden head,</LINE>
<LINE>By the simplicity of Venus&#8217; doves,</LINE>
<LINE>By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves,</LINE>
<LINE>And by that fire which burn&#8217;d the Carthage queen</LINE>
<LINE>When the false Troyan under sail was seen,</LINE>
<LINE>By all the vows that ever men have broke</LINE>
<LINE>(In number more than ever women spoke),</LINE>
<LINE>In that same place thou hast appointed me</LINE>
<LINE>Tomorrow truly will I meet with thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LYS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Keep promise, love. Look, here comes Helena.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Helena.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>God speed fair Helena! Whither away?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HEL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Call you me fair? That fair again unsay.</LINE>
<LINE>Demetrius loves your fair, O happy fair!</LINE>
<LINE>Your eyes are lodestars, and your tongue&#8217;s sweet air</LINE>
<LINE>More tuneable than lark to shepherd&#8217;s ear</LINE>
<LINE>When wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear.</LINE>
<LINE>Sickness is catching; O, were favor so,</LINE>
<LINE>Yours would I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go;</LINE>
<LINE>My ear should catch your voice, my eye your eye,</LINE>
<LINE>My tongue should catch your tongue&#8217;s sweet melody.</LINE>
<LINE>Were the world mine, Demetrius being bated,</LINE>
<LINE>The rest I&#8217;ll give to be to you translated.</LINE>
<LINE>O, teach me how you look, and with what art</LINE>
<LINE>You sway the motion of Demetrius&#8217; heart.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I frown upon him; yet he loves me still.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HEL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I give him curses; yet he gives me love.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HEL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O that my prayers could such affection move!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The more I hate, the more he follows me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HEL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The more I love, the more he hateth me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>His folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HEL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>None but your beauty; would that fault were mine!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Take comfort; he no more shall see my face;</LINE>
<LINE>Lysander and myself will fly this place.</LINE>
<LINE>Before the time I did Lysander see,</LINE>
<LINE>Seem&#8217;d Athens as a paradise to me;</LINE>
<LINE>O then, what graces in my love do dwell,</LINE>
<LINE>That he hath turn&#8217;d a heaven unto a hell!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LYS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Helen, to you our minds we will unfold:</LINE>
<LINE>Tomorrow night, when Phoebe doth behold</LINE>
<LINE>Her silver visage in the wat&#8217;ry glass,</LINE>
<LINE>Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass</LINE>
<LINE>(A time that lovers&#8217; flights doth still conceal),</LINE>
<LINE>Through Athens gates have we devis&#8217;d to steal.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And in the wood, where often you and I</LINE>
<LINE>Upon faint primrose beds were wont to lie,</LINE>
<LINE>Emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet,</LINE>
<LINE>There my Lysander and myself shall meet;</LINE>
<LINE>And thence from Athens turn away our eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>To seek new friends and stranger companies.</LINE>
<LINE>Farewell, sweet playfellow, pray thou for us;</LINE>
<LINE>And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius!</LINE>
<LINE>Keep word, Lysander; we must starve our sight</LINE>
<LINE>From lovers&#8217; food till morrow deep midnight.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LYS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will, my Hermia.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exit Hermia.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE offset="4">Helena, <FRENCH lang="fr">adieu</FRENCH>:</LINE>
<LINE>As you on him, Demetrius dote on you!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit Lysander.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HEL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How happy some o&#8217;er other some can be!</LINE>
<LINE>Through Athens I am thought as fair as she.</LINE>
<LINE>But what of that? Demetrius thinks not so;</LINE>
<LINE>He will not know what all but he do know;</LINE>
<LINE>And as he errs, doting on Hermia&#8217;s eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>So I, admiring of his qualities.</LINE>
<LINE>Things base and vile, holding no quantity,</LINE>
<LINE>Love can transpose to form and dignity.</LINE>
<LINE>Love looks not with the eyes but with the mind;</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore is wing&#8217;d Cupid painted blind.</LINE>
<LINE>Nor hath Love&#8217;s mind of any judgment taste;</LINE>
<LINE>Wings, and no eyes, figure unheedy haste;</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore is Love said to be a child,</LINE>
<LINE>Because in choice he is so oft beguil&#8217;d.</LINE>
<LINE>As waggish boys in game themselves forswear,</LINE>
<LINE>So the boy Love is perjur&#8217;d every where;</LINE>
<LINE>For ere Demetrius look&#8217;d on Hermia&#8217;s eyne,</LINE>
<LINE>He hail&#8217;d down oaths that he was only mine;</LINE>
<LINE>And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt,</LINE>
<LINE>So he dissolv&#8217;d, and show&#8217;rs of oaths did melt.</LINE>
<LINE>I will go tell him of fair Hermia&#8217;s flight;</LINE>
<LINE>Then to the wood will he tomorrow night</LINE>
<LINE>Pursue her; and for this intelligence</LINE>
<LINE>If I have thanks, it is a dear expense.</LINE>
<LINE>But herein mean I to enrich my pain,</LINE>
<LINE>To have his sight thither and back again.</LINE>

<SCENEPERSONAE>(Quince, Snug, Bottom, Flute, Snout, Starveling)</SCENEPERSONAE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Quince the carpenter and Snug the joiner and Bottom the weaver and Flute the bellows-mender and Snout the tinker and Starveling the tailor.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUIN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is all our company here?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BOT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You were best to call them generally, man by man, according to the scrip.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUIN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here is the scroll of every man&#8217;s name, which is thought fit, through all Athens, to play in our enterlude before the Duke and the Duchess, on his wedding-day at night.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BOT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>First, good Peter Quince, say what the play treats on; then read the names of the actors; and so grow to a point.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUIN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, our play is The most lamentable comedy and most cruel death of Pyramus and Thisby.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BOT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A very good piece of work, I assure you, and a merry. Now, good Peter Quince, call forth your actors by the scroll. Masters, spread yourselves.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUIN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Answer as I call you. Nick Bottom the weaver.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BOT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ready. Name what part I am for, and proceed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUIN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You, Nick Bottom, are set down for Pyramus.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BOT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What is Pyramus? A lover, or a tyrant?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUIN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A lover, that kills himself most gallant for love.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BOT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That will ask some tears in the true performing of it. If I do it, let the audience look to their eyes. I will move storms; I will condole in some measure. To the rest&#8212;yet my chief humor is for a tyrant. I could play Ercles rarely, or a part to tear a cat in, to make all split.</LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>&#8220;The raging rocks</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>And shivering shocks</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>Shall break the locks</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>Of prison gates;</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>And Phibbus&#8217; car</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>Shall shine from far,</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>And make and mar</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>The foolish Fates.&#8221;</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE>This was lofty! Now name the rest of the players. This is Ercles&#8217; vein, a tyrant&#8217;s vein; a lover is more condoling.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>QUIN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Flute, you must take Thisby on you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FLU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What is Thisby? A wand&#8217;ring knight?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUIN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is the lady that Pyramus must love.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FLU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, faith; let not me play a woman; I have a beard coming.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUIN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That&#8217;s all one; you shall play it in a mask, and you may speak as small as you will.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BOT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And I may hide my face, let me play Thisby too. I&#8217;ll speak in a monstrous little voice, &#8220;Thisne! Thisne! Ah, Pyramus, my lover dear! Thy Thisby dear, and lady dear!&#8221;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUIN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, no, you must play Pyramus; and, Flute, you Thisby.</LINE>

<LINE>Here, Peter Quince.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUIN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You, Pyramus&#8217; father; myself, Thisby&#8217;s father; Snug the joiner, you the lion&#8217;s part. And I hope here is a play fitted.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SNUG.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Have you the lion&#8217;s part written? Pray you, if it be, give it me, for I am slow of study.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUIN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You may do it extempore, for it is nothing but roaring.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BOT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let me play the lion too. I will roar, that I will do any man&#8217;s heart good to hear me. I will roar, that I will make the Duke say, &#8220;Let him roar again; let him roar again.&#8221;</LINE>

<LINE>I grant you, friends, if you should fright the ladies out of their wits, they would have no more discretion but to hang us; but I will aggravate my voice so that I will roar you as gently as any sucking dove; I will roar you and &#8217;twere any nightingale.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUIN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You can play no part but Pyramus; for Pyramus is a sweet-fac&#8217;d man; a proper man as one shall see in a summer&#8217;s day; a most lovely gentleman-like man: therefore you must needs play Pyramus.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BOT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well; I will undertake it. What beard were I best to play it in?</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUIN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, what you will.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BOT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will discharge it in either your straw-color beard, your orange-tawny beard, your purple-in-grain beard, or your French-crown-color beard, your perfit yellow.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUIN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Some of your French crowns have no hair at all; and then you will play barefac&#8217;d. But, masters, here are your parts, and I am to entreat you, request you, and desire you, to con them by tomorrow night; and meet me in the palace wood, a mile without the town, by moonlight; there will we rehearse; for if we meet in the city, we shall be dogg&#8217;d with company, and our devices known. In the meantime I will draw a bill of properties, such as our play wants. I pray you fail me not.</LINE>

<LINE>Our Queen and all her elves come here anon.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PUCK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The King doth keep his revels here tonight;</LINE>
<LINE>Take heed the Queen come not within his sight;</LINE>
<LINE>For Oberon is passing fell and wrath,</LINE>
<LINE>Because that she as her attendant hath</LINE>
<LINE>A lovely boy stolen from an Indian king;</LINE>
<LINE>She never had so sweet a changeling.</LINE>
<LINE>And jealous Oberon would have the child</LINE>
<LINE>Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild;</LINE>
<LINE>But she, perforce, withholds the loved boy,</LINE>
<LINE>Crowns him with flowers, and makes him all her joy.</LINE>
<LINE>And now they never meet in grove or green,</LINE>
<LINE>By fountain clear, or spangled starlight sheen,</LINE>
<LINE>But they do square, that all their elves for fear</LINE>
<LINE>Creep into acorn-cups, and hide them there.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>FAIRY.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Either I mistake your shape and making quite,</LINE>
<LINE>Or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite</LINE>
<LINE>Call&#8217;d Robin Goodfellow. Are not you he</LINE>
<LINE>That frights the maidens of the villagery,</LINE>
<LINE>Skim milk, and sometimes labor in the quern,</LINE>
<LINE>And bootless make the breathless huswife churn,</LINE>
<LINE>And sometime make the drink to bear no barm,</LINE>
<LINE>Mislead night-wanderers, laughing at their harm?</LINE>
<LINE>Those that Hobgoblin call you, and sweet Puck,</LINE>
<LINE>You do their work, and they shall have good luck.</LINE>
<LINE>Are not you he?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PUCK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="3">Thou speakest aright;</LINE>
<LINE>I am that merry wanderer of the night.</LINE>
<LINE>I jest to Oberon and make him smile</LINE>
<LINE>When I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile,</LINE>
<LINE>Neighing in likeness of a filly foal;</LINE>
<LINE>And sometime lurk I in a gossip&#8217;s bowl,</LINE>
<LINE>In very likeness of a roasted crab,</LINE>
<LINE>And when she drinks, against her lips I bob,</LINE>
<LINE>And on her withered dewlop pour the ale.</LINE>
<LINE>The wisest aunt, telling the saddest tale,</LINE>
<LINE>Sometime for three-foot stool mistaketh me;</LINE>
<LINE>Then slip I from her bum, down topples she,</LINE>
<LINE>And &#8220;tailor&#8221; cries, and falls into a cough;</LINE>
<LINE>And then the whole quire hold their hips and loff,</LINE>
<LINE>And waxen in their mirth, and neeze, and swear</LINE>
<LINE>A merrier hour was never wasted there.</LINE>
<LINE>But room, fairy! Here comes Oberon.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter the King of Fairies Oberon at one door with his Train, and the Queen Titania at another with hers.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OBE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TITA.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, jealous Oberon? Fairies, skip hence&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>I have forsworn his bed and company.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OBE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tarry, rash wanton! Am not I thy lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TITA.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then I must be thy lady; but I know</LINE>
<LINE>When thou hast stolen away from fairy land,</LINE>
<LINE>And in the shape of Corin sat all day,</LINE>
<LINE>Playing on pipes of corn, and versing love,</LINE>
<LINE>To amorous Phillida. Why art thou here</LINE>
<LINE>Come from the farthest steep of India?</LINE>
<LINE>But that, forsooth, the bouncing Amazon,</LINE>
<LINE>Your buskin&#8217;d mistress, and your warrior love,</LINE>
<LINE>To Theseus must be wedded, and you come</LINE>
<LINE>To give their bed joy and prosperity.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OBE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How canst thou thus for shame, Titania,</LINE>
<LINE>Glance at my credit with Hippolyta,</LINE>
<LINE>Knowing I know thy love to Theseus?</LINE>
<LINE>Didst not thou lead him through the glimmering night</LINE>
<LINE>From Perigenia, whom he ravished?</LINE>
<LINE>And make him with fair Aegles break his faith,</LINE>
<LINE>With Ariadne, and Antiopa?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TITA.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>These are the forgeries of jealousy;</LINE>
<LINE>And never, since the middle summer&#8217;s spring,</LINE>
<LINE>Met we on hill, in dale, forest, or mead,</LINE>
<LINE>By paved fountain or by rushy brook,</LINE>
<LINE>Or in the beached margent of the sea,</LINE>
<LINE>To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind,</LINE>
<LINE>But with thy brawls thou hast disturb&#8217;d our sport.</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore the winds, piping to us in vain,</LINE>
<LINE>As in revenge, have suck&#8217;d up from the sea</LINE>
<LINE>Contagious fogs; which, falling in the land,</LINE>
<LINE>Hath every pelting river made so proud</LINE>
<LINE>That they have overborne their continents.</LINE>
<LINE>The ox hath therefore stretch&#8217;d his yoke in vain,</LINE>
<LINE>The ploughman lost his sweat, and the green corn</LINE>
<LINE>Hath rotted ere his youth attain&#8217;d a beard.</LINE>
<LINE>The fold stands empty in the drowned field,</LINE>
<LINE>And crows are fatted with the murrion flock;</LINE>
<LINE>The nine men&#8217;s morris is fill&#8217;d up with mud,</LINE>
<LINE>And the quaint mazes in the wanton green,</LINE>
<LINE>For lack of tread, are undistinguishable.</LINE>
<LINE>The human mortals want their winter here;</LINE>
<LINE>No night is now with hymn or carol blest.</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore the moon (the governess of floods),</LINE>
<LINE>Pale in her anger, washes all the air,</LINE>
<LINE>That rheumatic diseases do abound.</LINE>
<LINE>And thorough this distemperature, we see</LINE>
<LINE>The seasons alter: hoary-headed frosts</LINE>
<LINE>Fall in the fresh lap of the crimson rose,</LINE>
<LINE>And on old Hiems&#8217; thin and icy crown</LINE>
<LINE>An odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds</LINE>
<LINE>Is, as in mockery, set; the spring, the summer,</LINE>
<LINE>The childing autumn, angry winter, change</LINE>
<LINE>Their wonted liveries; and the mazed world,</LINE>
<LINE>By their increase, now knows not which is which.</LINE>
<LINE>And this same progeny of evils comes</LINE>
<LINE>From our debate, from our dissension;</LINE>
<LINE>We are their parents and original.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OBE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do you amend it then; it lies in you.</LINE>
<LINE>Why should Titania cross her Oberon?</LINE>
<LINE>I do but beg a little changeling boy,</LINE>
<LINE>To be my henchman.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TITA.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Set your heart at rest;</LINE>
<LINE>The fairy land buys not the child of me.</LINE>
<LINE>His mother was a vot&#8217;ress of my order,</LINE>
<LINE>And in the spiced Indian air, by night,</LINE>
<LINE>Full often hath she gossip&#8217;d by my side,</LINE>
<LINE>And sat with me on Neptune&#8217;s yellow sands,</LINE>
<LINE>Marking th&#8217; embarked traders on the flood;</LINE>
<LINE>When we have laugh&#8217;d to see the sails conceive</LINE>
<LINE>And grow big-bellied with the wanton wind;</LINE>
<LINE>Which she, with pretty and with swimming gait,</LINE>
<LINE>Following (her womb then rich with my young squire)</LINE>
<LINE>Would imitate, and sail upon the land</LINE>
<LINE>To fetch me trifles, and return again,</LINE>
<LINE>As from a voyage, rich with merchandise.</LINE>
<LINE>But she, being mortal, of that boy did die,</LINE>
<LINE>And for her sake do I rear up her boy;</LINE>
<LINE>And for her sake I will not part with him.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OBE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How long within this wood intend you stay?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TITA.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Perchance till after Theseus&#8217; wedding-day.</LINE>
<LINE>If you will patiently dance in our round,</LINE>
<LINE>And see our moonlight revels, go with us;</LINE>
<LINE>If not, shun me, and I will spare your haunts.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OBE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Give me that boy, and I will go with thee.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OBE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well; go thy way. Thou shalt not from this grove</LINE>
<LINE>Till I torment thee for this injury.</LINE>
<LINE>My gentle Puck, come hither. Thou rememb&#8217;rest</LINE>
<LINE>Since once I sat upon a promontory,</LINE>
<LINE>And heard a mermaid on a dolphin&#8217;s back</LINE>
<LINE>Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath</LINE>
<LINE>That the rude sea grew civil at her song,</LINE>
<LINE>And certain stars shot madly from their spheres,</LINE>
<LINE>To hear the sea-maid&#8217;s music?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PUCK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">I remember.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OBE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That very time I saw (but thou couldst not),</LINE>
<LINE>Flying between the cold moon and the earth,</LINE>
<LINE>Cupid all arm&#8217;d. A certain aim he took</LINE>
<LINE>At a fair vestal throned by the west,</LINE>
<LINE>And loos&#8217;d his love-shaft smartly from his bow,</LINE>
<LINE>As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts;</LINE>
<LINE>But I might see young Cupid&#8217;s fiery shaft</LINE>
<LINE>Quench&#8217;d in the chaste beams of the wat&#8217;ry moon,</LINE>
<LINE>And the imperial vot&#8217;ress passed on,</LINE>
<LINE>In maiden meditation, fancy-free.</LINE>
<LINE>Yet mark&#8217;d I where the bolt of Cupid fell.</LINE>
<LINE>It fell upon a little western flower,</LINE>
<LINE>Before milk-white, now purple with love&#8217;s wound,</LINE>
<LINE>And maidens call it love-in-idleness.</LINE>
<LINE>Fetch me that flow&#8217;r; the herb I showed thee once.</LINE>
<LINE>The juice of it on sleeping eyelids laid</LINE>
<LINE>Will make or man or woman madly dote</LINE>
<LINE>Upon the next live creature that it sees.</LINE>
<LINE>Fetch me this herb, and be thou here again</LINE>
<LINE>Ere the leviathan can swim a league.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PUCK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll put a girdle round about the earth</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OBE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Having once this juice,</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll watch Titania when she is asleep,</LINE>
<LINE>And drop the liquor of it in her eyes;</LINE>
<LINE>The next thing then she waking looks upon</LINE>
<LINE>(Be it on lion, bear, or wolf, or bull,</LINE>
<LINE>On meddling monkey, or on busy ape),</LINE>
<LINE>She shall pursue it with the soul of love.</LINE>
<LINE>And ere I take this charm from off her sight</LINE>
<LINE>(As I can take it with another herb),</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll make her render up her page to me.</LINE>
<LINE>But who comes here? I am invisible,</LINE>

<LINE>Thou toldst me they were stol&#8217;n unto this wood;</LINE>
<LINE>And here am I, and wode within this wood,</LINE>
<LINE>Because I cannot meet my Hermia.</LINE>
<LINE>Hence, get thee gone, and follow me no more.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HEL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You draw me, you hard-hearted adamant;</LINE>
<LINE>But yet you draw not iron, for my heart</LINE>

<LINE>And I shall have no power to follow you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DEM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do I entice you? Do I speak you fair?</LINE>
<LINE>Or rather do I not in plainest truth</LINE>
<LINE>Tell you I do not nor I cannot love you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HEL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And even for that do I love you the more;</LINE>
<LINE>I am your spaniel; and, Demetrius,</LINE>
<LINE>The more you beat me, I will fawn on you.</LINE>
<LINE>Use me but as your spaniel; spurn me, strike me,</LINE>
<LINE>Neglect me, lose me; only give me leave,</LINE>
<LINE>Unworthy as I am, to follow you.</LINE>
<LINE>What worser place can I beg in your love</LINE>
<LINE>(And yet a place of high respect with me)</LINE>
<LINE>Than to be used as you use your dog?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DEM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit,</LINE>
<LINE>For I am sick when I do look on thee.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HEL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And I am sick when I look not on you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DEM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You do impeach your modesty too much,</LINE>
<LINE>To leave the city and commit yourself</LINE>
<LINE>Into the hands of one that loves you not;</LINE>
<LINE>To trust the opportunity of night,</LINE>
<LINE>And the ill counsel of a desert place,</LINE>
<LINE>With the rich worth of your virginity.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HEL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your virtue is my privilege. For that</LINE>
<LINE>It is not night when I do see your face,</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore I think I am not in the night,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor doth this wood lack worlds of company,</LINE>
<LINE>For you in my respect are all the world.</LINE>
<LINE>Then how can it be said I am alone,</LINE>
<LINE>When all the world is here to look on me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DEM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll run from thee, and hide me in the brakes,</LINE>
<LINE>And leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HEL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The wildest hath not such a heart as you.</LINE>
<LINE>Run when you will; the story shall be chang&#8217;d:</LINE>
<LINE>Apollo flies, and Daphne holds the chase;</LINE>
<LINE>The dove pursues the griffin; the mild hind</LINE>
<LINE>Makes speed to catch the tiger&#8212;bootless speed,</LINE>
<LINE>When cowardice pursues and valor flies.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DEM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will not stay thy questions. Let me go;</LINE>
<LINE>Or if thou follow me, do not believe</LINE>
<LINE>But I shall do thee mischief in the wood.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HEL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, in the temple, in the town, the field,</LINE>
<LINE>You do me mischief. Fie, Demetrius!</LINE>
<LINE>Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex.</LINE>
<LINE>We cannot fight for love, as men may do.</LINE>
<LINE>We should be woo&#8217;d, and were not made to woo.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exit Demetrius.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll follow thee and make a heaven of hell,</LINE>
<LINE>To die upon the hand I love so well.</LINE>

<LINE>Weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in;</LINE>
<LINE>And with the juice of this I&#8217;ll streak her eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>And make her full of hateful fantasies.</LINE>
<LINE>Take thou some of it, and seek through this grove:</LINE>
<LINE>A sweet Athenian lady is in love</LINE>
<LINE>With a disdainful youth; anoint his eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>But do it when the next thing he espies</LINE>
<LINE>May be the lady. Thou shalt know the man</LINE>
<LINE>By the Athenian garments he hath on.</LINE>
<LINE>Effect it with some care, that he may prove</LINE>

<LINE>If so, my eyes are oft&#8217;ner wash&#8217;d than hers.</LINE>
<LINE>No, no; I am as ugly as a bear;</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>What sayest thou, bully Bottom?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BOT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There are things in this comedy of Pyramus and Thisby that will never please. First, Pyramus must draw a sword to kill himself; which the ladies cannot abide. How answer you that?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SNOUT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By&#8217;r lakin, a parlous fear.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>STAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I believe we must leave the killing out, when all is done.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BOT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not a whit! I have a device to make all well. Write me a prologue, and let the prologue seem to say we will do no harm with our swords, and that Pyramus is not kill&#8217;d indeed; and for the more better assurance, tell them that I Pyramus am not Pyramus, but Bottom the weaver. This will put them out of fear.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUIN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well; we will have such a prologue, and it shall be written in eight and six.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BOT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No; make it two more; let it be written in eight and eight.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SNOUT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Will not the ladies be afeard of the lion?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>STAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I fear it, I promise you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BOT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Masters, you ought to consider with yourselves, to bring in (God shield us!) a lion among ladies, is a most dreadful thing; for there is not a more fearful wild-fowl than your lion living; and we ought to look to&#8217;t.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SNOUT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Therefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BOT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay; you must name his name, and half his face must be seen through the lion&#8217;s neck, and he himself muse speak through, saying thus, or to the same defect: &#8220;Ladies,&#8221; or &#8220;Fair ladies, I would wish you,&#8221; or &#8220;I would request you,&#8221; or &#8220;I would entreat you, not to fear, not to tremble: my life for yours. If you think I come hither as a lion, it were pity of my life. No! I am no such thing; I am a man as other men are&#8221;; and there indeed let him name his name, and tell them plainly he is Snug the joiner.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUIN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well; it shall be so. But there is two hard things: that is, to bring the moonlight into a chamber; for you know, Pyramus and Thisby meet by moonlight.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SNOUT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Doth the moon shine that night we play our play?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BOT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A calendar, a calendar! Look in the almanac. Find out moonshine, find out moonshine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUIN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes; it doth shine that night.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BOT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why then may you leave a casement of the great chamber window (where we play) open; and the moon may shine in at the casement.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUIN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay; or else one must come in with a bush of thorns and a lantern, and say he comes to disfigure, or to present, the person of Moonshine. Then, there is another thing: we must have a wall in the great chamber; for Pyramus and Thisby (says the story) did talk through the chink of a wall.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SNOUT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You can never bring in a wall. What say you, Bottom?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BOT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Some man or other must present Wall; and let him have some plaster, or some loam, or some rough-cast about him, to signify wall; or let him hold his fingers thus, and through that cranny shall Pyramus and Thisby whisper.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUIN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If that may be, then all is well. Come, sit down, every mother&#8217;s son, and rehearse your parts. Pyramus, you begin. When you have spoken your speech, enter into that brake; and so every one according to his cue.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>PUCK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My mistress with a monster is in love.</LINE>
<LINE>Near to her close and consecrated bower,</LINE>
<LINE>While she was in her dull and sleeping hour,</LINE>
<LINE>A crew of patches, rude mechanicals,</LINE>
<LINE>That work for bread upon Athenian stalls,</LINE>
<LINE>Were met together to rehearse a play</LINE>
<LINE>Intended for great Theseus&#8217; nuptial day.</LINE>
<LINE>The shallowest thick-skin of that barren sort,</LINE>
<LINE>Who Pyramus presented, in their sport,</LINE>
<LINE>Forsook his scene, and ent&#8217;red in a brake;</LINE>
<LINE>When I did him at this advantage take,</LINE>
<LINE>An ass&#8217;s nole I fixed on his head.</LINE>
<LINE>Anon his Thisby must be answered,</LINE>
<LINE>And forth my mimic comes. When they him spy,</LINE>
<LINE>As wild geese that the creeping fowler eye,</LINE>
<LINE>Or russet-pated choughs, many in sort</LINE>
<LINE>(Rising and cawing at the gun&#8217;s report),</LINE>
<LINE>Sever themselves and madly sweep the sky,</LINE>
<LINE>So, at his sight, away his fellows fly;</LINE>
<LINE>And at our stamp, here o&#8217;er and o&#8217;er one falls;</LINE>
<LINE>He murder cries, and help from Athens calls.</LINE>
<LINE>Their sense thus weak, lost with their fears thus strong,</LINE>
<LINE>Made senseless things begin to do them wrong,</LINE>
<LINE>For briers and thorns at their apparel snatch;</LINE>
<LINE>Some sleeves, some hats, from yielders all things catch.</LINE>
<LINE>I led them on in this distracted fear,</LINE>
<LINE>And left sweet Pyramus translated there;</LINE>
<LINE>When in that moment (so it came to pass)</LINE>
<LINE>Titania wak&#8217;d, and straightway lov&#8217;d an ass.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OBE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This falls out better than I could devise.</LINE>
<LINE>But hast thou yet latch&#8217;d the Athenian&#8217;s eyes</LINE>
<LINE>With the love-juice, as I did bid thee do?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PUCK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I took him sleeping (that is finish&#8217;d too)</LINE>
<LINE>And the Athenian woman by his side;</LINE>
<LINE>That when he wak&#8217;d, of force she must be ey&#8217;d.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Demetrius and Hermia.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OBE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Stand close; this is the same Athenian.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PUCK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This is the woman; but not this the man.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DEM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, why rebuke you him that loves you so?</LINE>
<LINE>Lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now I but chide; but I should use thee worse,</LINE>
<LINE>For thou (I fear) hast given me cause to curse.</LINE>
<LINE>If thou hast slain Lysander in his sleep,</LINE>
<LINE>Being o&#8217;er shoes in blood, plunge in the deep,</LINE>
<LINE>And kill me too.</LINE>
<LINE>The sun was not so true unto the day</LINE>
<LINE>As he to me. Would he have stolen away</LINE>
<LINE>From sleeping Hermia? I&#8217;ll believe as soon</LINE>
<LINE>This whole earth may be bor&#8217;d, and that the moon</LINE>
<LINE>May through the centre creep, and so displease</LINE>
<LINE>Her brother&#8217;s noontide with th&#8217; Antipodes.</LINE>
<LINE>It cannot be but thou hast murd&#8217;red him;</LINE>
<LINE>So should a murderer look&#8212;so dead, so grim.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DEM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So should the murdered look, and so should I,</LINE>
<LINE>Pierc&#8217;d through the heart with your stern cruelty.</LINE>
<LINE>Yet you, the murderer, look as bright, as clear,</LINE>
<LINE>As yonder Venus in her glimmering sphere.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What&#8217;s this to my Lysander? Where is he?</LINE>
<LINE>Ah, good Demetrius, wilt thou give him me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DEM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I had rather give his carcass to my hounds.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Out, dog, out, cur! Thou driv&#8217;st me past the bounds</LINE>
<LINE>Of maiden&#8217;s patience. Hast thou slain him then?</LINE>
<LINE>Henceforth be never numb&#8217;red among men!</LINE>
<LINE>O, once tell true; tell true, even for my sake!</LINE>
<LINE>Durst thou have look&#8217;d upon him being awake?</LINE>
<LINE>And hast thou kill&#8217;d him sleeping? O brave touch!</LINE>
<LINE>Could not a worm, an adder, do so much?</LINE>
<LINE>An adder did it! For with doubler tongue</LINE>
<LINE>Than thine, thou serpent, never adder stung.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DEM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You spend your passion on a mispris&#8217;d mood.</LINE>
<LINE>I am not guilty of Lysander&#8217;s blood;</LINE>
<LINE>Nor is he dead, for aught that I can tell.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I pray thee, tell me then that he is well.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DEM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And if I could, what should I get therefore?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A privilege never to see me more.</LINE>
<LINE>And from thy hated presence part I so:</LINE>
<LINE>See me no more, whether he be dead or no.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DEM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There is no following her in this fierce vein.</LINE>
<LINE>Here therefore for a while I will remain.</LINE>
<LINE>So sorrow&#8217;s heaviness doth heavier grow</LINE>
<LINE>For debt that bankrout sleep doth sorrow owe;</LINE>
<LINE>Which now in some slight measure it will pay,</LINE>
<LINE>If for his tender here I make some stay.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Lie down and sleep.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OBE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What hast thou done? Thou hast mistaken quite,</LINE>
<LINE>And laid the love-juice on some true-love&#8217;s sight.</LINE>
<LINE>Of thy misprision must perforce ensue</LINE>
<LINE>Some true love turn&#8217;d, and not a false turn&#8217;d true.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PUCK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then fate o&#8217;errules, that one man holding troth,</LINE>
<LINE>A million fail, confounding oath on oath.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OBE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>About the wood go swifter than the wind,</LINE>
<LINE>And Helena of Athens look thou find.</LINE>
<LINE>All fancy-sick she is and pale of cheer</LINE>
<LINE>With sighs of love, that costs the fresh blood dear.</LINE>
<LINE>By some illusion see thou bring her here.</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll charm his eyes against she do appear.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PUCK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I go, I go, look how I go,</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Lysander and Helena.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LYS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why should you think that I should woo in scorn?</LINE>
<LINE>Scorn and derision never come in tears.</LINE>
<LINE>Look when I vow, I weep; and vows so born,</LINE>
<LINE>In their nativity all truth appears.</LINE>
<LINE>How can these things in me seem scorn to you,</LINE>
<LINE>Bearing the badge of faith to prove them true?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HEL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You do advance your cunning more and more;</LINE>
<LINE>When truth kills truth, O devilish-holy fray!</LINE>
<LINE>These vows are Hermia&#8217;s. Will you give her o&#8217;er?</LINE>
<LINE>Weigh oath with oath, and you will nothing weigh.</LINE>
<LINE>Your vows to her and me, put in two scales,</LINE>
<LINE>Will even weigh; and both as light as tales.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LYS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I had no judgment when to her I swore.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HEL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nor none, in my mind, now you give her o&#8217;er.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DEM.</SPEAKER>
<STAGEDIR>Awaking.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>O Helen, goddess, nymph, perfect, divine!</LINE>
<LINE>To what, my love, shall I compare thine eyne?</LINE>
<LINE>Crystal is muddy. O, how ripe in show</LINE>
<LINE>Thy lips, those kissing cherries, tempting grow!</LINE>
<LINE>That pure congealed white, high Taurus&#8217; snow,</LINE>
<LINE>Fann&#8217;d with the eastern wind, turns to a crow</LINE>
<LINE>When thou hold&#8217;st up thy hand. O, let me kiss</LINE>
<LINE>This princess of pure white, this seal of bliss!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HEL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O spite! O hell! I see you all are bent</LINE>
<LINE>To set against me for your merriment.</LINE>
<LINE>If you were civil and knew courtesy,</LINE>
<LINE>You would not do me thus much injury.</LINE>
<LINE>Can you not hate me, as I know you do,</LINE>
<LINE>But you must join in souls to mock me too?</LINE>
<LINE>If you were men, as men you are in show,</LINE>
<LINE>You would not use a gentle lady so;</LINE>
<LINE>To vow, and swear, and superpraise my parts,</LINE>
<LINE>When I am sure you hate me with your hearts.</LINE>
<LINE>You both are rivals, and love Hermia;</LINE>
<LINE>And now both rivals, to mock Helena.</LINE>
<LINE>A trim exploit, a manly enterprise,</LINE>
<LINE>To conjure tears up in a poor maid&#8217;s eyes</LINE>
<LINE>With your derision! None of noble sort</LINE>
<LINE>Would so offend a virgin, and extort</LINE>
<LINE>A poor soul&#8217;s patience, all to make you sport.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LYS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You are unkind, Demetrius; be not so;</LINE>
<LINE>For you love Hermia; this you know I know.</LINE>

<LINE>In Hermia&#8217;s love I yield you up my part;</LINE>

<LINE>Lysander, keep thy Hermia; I will none.</LINE>
<LINE>If e&#8217;er I lov&#8217;d her, all that love is gone.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Dark night, that from the eye his function takes,</LINE>
<LINE>The ear more quick of apprehension makes;</LINE>
<LINE>Wherein it doth impair the seeing sense,</LINE>
<LINE>It pays the hearing double recompense,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou art not by mine eye, Lysander, found;</LINE>
<LINE>Mine ear, I thank it, brought me to thy sound.</LINE>
<LINE>But why unkindly didst thou leave me so?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LYS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why should he stay, whom love doth press to go?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What love could press Lysander from my side?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LYS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Lysander&#8217;s love, that would not let him bide&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Fair Helena! Who more engilds the night</LINE>
<LINE>Than all yon fiery oes and eyes of light.</LINE>
<LINE>Why seek&#8217;st thou me? Could not this make thee know,</LINE>
<LINE>The hate I bare thee made me leave thee so?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You speak not as you think. It cannot be.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HEL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Lo! She is one of this confederacy.</LINE>
<LINE>Now I perceive, they have conjoin&#8217;d all three</LINE>
<LINE>To fashion this false sport, in spite of me.</LINE>
<LINE>Injurious Hermia, most ungrateful maid!</LINE>
<LINE>Have you conspir&#8217;d, have you with these contriv&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>To bait me with this foul derision?</LINE>
<LINE>Is all the counsel that we two have shar&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>The sisters&#8217; vows, the hours that we have spent,</LINE>
<LINE>When we have chid the hasty-footed time</LINE>
<LINE>For parting us&#8212;O, is all forgot?</LINE>
<LINE>All school-days friendship, childhood innocence?</LINE>
<LINE>We, Hermia, like two artificial gods,</LINE>
<LINE>Have with our needles created both one flower,</LINE>
<LINE>Both on one sampler, sitting on one cushion,</LINE>
<LINE>Both warbling of one song, both in one key,</LINE>
<LINE>As if our hands, our sides, voices, and minds</LINE>
<LINE>Had been incorporate. So we grew together,</LINE>
<LINE>Like to a double cherry, seeming parted,</LINE>
<LINE>But yet an union in partition,</LINE>
<LINE>Two lovely berries moulded on one stem;</LINE>
<LINE>So with two seeming bodies, but one heart,</LINE>
<LINE>Two of the first, like coats in heraldry,</LINE>
<LINE>Due but to one, and crowned with one crest.</LINE>
<LINE>And will you rent our ancient love asunder,</LINE>
<LINE>To join with men in scorning your poor friend?</LINE>
<LINE>It is not friendly, &#8217;tis not maidenly.</LINE>
<LINE>Our sex, as well as I, may chide you for it,</LINE>
<LINE>Though I alone do feel the injury.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am amazed at your passionate words.</LINE>
<LINE>I scorn you not; it seems that you scorn me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HEL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Have you not set Lysander, as in scorn,</LINE>
<LINE>To follow me and praise my eyes and face?</LINE>
<LINE>And made your other love, Demetrius</LINE>
<LINE>(Who even but now did spurn me with his foot),</LINE>
<LINE>To call me goddess, nymph, divine and rare,</LINE>
<LINE>Precious, celestial? Wherefore speaks he this</LINE>
<LINE>To her he hates? And wherefore doth Lysander</LINE>
<LINE>Deny your love (so rich within his soul)</LINE>
<LINE>And tender me (forsooth) affection,</LINE>
<LINE>But by your setting on, by your consent?</LINE>
<LINE>What though I be not so in grace as you,</LINE>
<LINE>So hung upon with love, so fortunate</LINE>
<LINE>(But miserable most, to love unlov&#8217;d)?</LINE>
<LINE>This you should pity rather than despise.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I understand not what you mean by this.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HEL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, do! Persever, counterfeit sad looks,</LINE>
<LINE>Make mouths upon me when I turn my back,</LINE>
<LINE>Wink each at other, hold the sweet jest up;</LINE>
<LINE>This sport, well carried, shall be chronicled.</LINE>
<LINE>If you have any pity, grace, or manners,</LINE>
<LINE>You would not make me such an argument.</LINE>
<LINE>But fare ye well; &#8217;tis partly my own fault,</LINE>
<LINE>Which death, or absence, soon shall remedy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LYS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Stay, gentle Helena; hear my excuse,</LINE>
<LINE>My love, my life, my soul, fair Helena!</LINE>

<LINE>If she cannot entreat, I can compel.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LYS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou canst compel no more than she entreat.</LINE>
<LINE>Thy threats have no more strength than her weak prays.</LINE>
<LINE>Helen, I love thee, by my life I do!</LINE>
<LINE>I swear by that which I will lose for thee,</LINE>
<LINE>To prove him false that says I love thee not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DEM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I say I love thee more than he can do.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LYS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hang off, thou cat, thou bur! Vile thing, let loose;</LINE>
<LINE>Or I will shake thee from me like a serpent!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why are you grown so rude? What change is this,</LINE>
<LINE>Sweet love?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LYS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="3">Thy love? Out, tawny Tartar, out!</LINE>
<LINE>Out, loathed med&#8217;cine! O hated potion, hence!</LINE>

<LINE>Demetrius, I will keep my word with thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DEM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would I had your bond, for I perceive</LINE>
<LINE>A weak bond holds you. I&#8217;ll not trust your word.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LYS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What? Should I hurt her, strike her, kill her dead?</LINE>
<LINE>Although I hate her, I&#8217;ll not harm her so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What? Can you do me greater harm than hate?</LINE>
<LINE>Hate me, wherefore? O me, what news, my love!</LINE>
<LINE>Am not I Hermia? Are not you Lysander?</LINE>
<LINE>I am as fair now as I was erewhile.</LINE>
<LINE>Since night you lov&#8217;d me; yet since night you left me:</LINE>
<LINE>Why then, you left me (O, the gods forbid!)</LINE>
<LINE>In earnest, shall I say?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LYS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Ay, by my life;</LINE>
<LINE>And never did desire to see thee more.</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore be out of hope, of question, of doubt;</LINE>
<LINE>Be certain! Nothing truer; &#8217;tis no jest</LINE>
<LINE>That I do hate thee, and love Helena.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O me, you juggler, you canker-blossom,</LINE>
<LINE>You thief of love! What, have you come by night</LINE>
<LINE>And stol&#8217;n my love&#8217;s heart from him?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HEL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="8">Fine, i&#8217; faith!</LINE>
<LINE>Have you no modesty, no maiden shame,</LINE>
<LINE>No touch of bashfulness? What, will you tear</LINE>
<LINE>Impatient answers from my gentle tongue?</LINE>
<LINE>Fie, fie, you counterfeit, you puppet, you!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8220;Puppet&#8221;? Why so? Ay, that way goes the game.</LINE>
<LINE>Now I perceive that she hath made compare</LINE>
<LINE>Between our statures: she hath urg&#8217;d her height,</LINE>
<LINE>And with her personage, her tall personage,</LINE>
<LINE>Her height, forsooth, she hath prevail&#8217;d with him.</LINE>
<LINE>And are you grown so high in his esteem,</LINE>
<LINE>Because I am so dwarfish and so low?</LINE>
<LINE>How low am I, thou painted maypole? Speak!</LINE>
<LINE>How low am I? I am not yet so low</LINE>
<LINE>But that my nails can reach unto thine eyes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HEL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I pray you, though you mock me, gentlemen,</LINE>
<LINE>Let her not hurt me. I was never curst;</LINE>
<LINE>I have no gift at all in shrewishness;</LINE>
<LINE>I am a right maid for my cowardice.</LINE>
<LINE>Let her not strike me. You perhaps may think,</LINE>
<LINE>Because she is something lower than myself,</LINE>
<LINE>That I can match her.</LINE>

<LINE>Good Hermia, do not be so bitter with me.</LINE>
<LINE>I evermore did love you, Hermia,</LINE>
<LINE>Did ever keep your counsels, never wrong&#8217;d you;</LINE>
<LINE>Save that, in love unto Demetrius,</LINE>
<LINE>I told him of your stealth unto this wood.</LINE>
<LINE>He followed you; for love I followed him.</LINE>
<LINE>But he hath chid me hence, and threat&#8217;ned me</LINE>
<LINE>To strike me, spurn me, nay, to kill me too.</LINE>
<LINE>And now, so you will let me quiet go,</LINE>
<LINE>To Athens will I bear my folly back,</LINE>
<LINE>And follow you no further. Let me go.</LINE>
<LINE>You see how simple and how fond I am.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, get you gone. Who is&#8217;t that hinders you?</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>O, when she is angry, she is keen and shrewd!</LINE>
<LINE>She was a vixen when she went to school;</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8220;Little&#8221; again? Nothing but &#8220;low&#8221; and &#8220;little&#8221;?</LINE>

<SPEAKER>DEM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">You are too officious</LINE>
<LINE>In her behalf that scorns your services.</LINE>
<LINE>Let her alone; speak not of Helena,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OBE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This is thy negligence. Still thou mistak&#8217;st,</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PUCK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Believe me, king of shadows, I mistook.</LINE>
<LINE>Did not you tell me I should know the man</LINE>
<LINE>By the Athenian garments he had on?</LINE>
<LINE>And so far blameless proves my enterprise,</LINE>
<LINE>That I have &#8217;nointed an Athenian&#8217;s eyes;</LINE>
<LINE>And so far am I glad it so did sort,</LINE>
<LINE>As this their jangling I esteem a sport.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OBE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou seest these lovers seek a place to fight;</LINE>
<LINE>Hie therefore, Robin, overcast the night;</LINE>
<LINE>The starry welkin cover thou anon</LINE>
<LINE>With drooping fog as black as Acheron,</LINE>
<LINE>And lead these testy rivals so astray</LINE>
<LINE>As one come not within another&#8217;s way.</LINE>
<LINE>Like to Lysander sometime frame thy tongue;</LINE>
<LINE>Then stir Demetrius up with bitter wrong;</LINE>
<LINE>And sometime rail thou like Demetrius;</LINE>
<LINE>And from each other look thou lead them thus,</LINE>
<LINE>Till o&#8217;er their brows death-counterfeiting sleep</LINE>
<LINE>With leaden legs and batty wings doth creep.</LINE>
<LINE>Then crush this herb into Lysander&#8217;s eye;</LINE>
<LINE>Whose liquor hath this virtuous property,</LINE>
<LINE>To take from thence all error with his might,</LINE>
<LINE>And make his eyeballs roll with wonted sight.</LINE>
<LINE>When they next wake, all this derision</LINE>
<LINE>Shall seem a dream and fruitless vision,</LINE>
<LINE>And back to Athens shall the lovers wend</LINE>
<LINE>With league whose date till death shall never end.</LINE>
<LINE>Whiles I in this affair do thee employ,</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll to my queen and beg her Indian boy;</LINE>
<LINE>And then I will her charmed eye release</LINE>
<LINE>From monster&#8217;s view, and all things shall be peace.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PUCK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My fairy lord, this must be done with haste,</LINE>
<LINE>For Night&#8217;s swift dragons cut the clouds full fast,</LINE>
<LINE>And yonder shines Aurora&#8217;s harbinger,</LINE>
<LINE>At whose approach, ghosts, wand&#8217;ring here and there,</LINE>
<LINE>Troop home to churchyards. Damned spirits all,</LINE>
<LINE>That in crossways and floods have burial,</LINE>
<LINE>Already to their wormy beds are gone.</LINE>
<LINE>For fear lest day should look their shames upon,</LINE>
<LINE>They willfully themselves exile from light,</LINE>
<LINE>And must for aye consort with black-brow&#8217;d Night.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OBE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But we are spirits of another sort.</LINE>
<LINE>I with the Morning&#8217;s love have oft made sport,</LINE>

<LINE>Even till the eastern gate, all fiery red,</LINE>
<LINE>Opening on Neptune with fair blessed beams,</LINE>
<LINE>Turns into yellow gold his salt green streams.</LINE>

<LINE>For meeting her of late behind the wood,</LINE>
<LINE>Seeking sweet favors for this hateful fool,</LINE>
<LINE>I did upbraid her, and fall out with her.</LINE>
<LINE>For she his hairy temples then had rounded</LINE>
<LINE>With coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers;</LINE>
<LINE>And that same dew which sometime on the buds</LINE>
<LINE>Was wont to swell like round and orient pearls,</LINE>
<LINE>Stood now within the pretty flouriets&#8217; eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>Like tears that did their own disgrace bewail.</LINE>
<LINE>When I had at my pleasure taunted her,</LINE>
<LINE>And she in mild terms begg&#8217;d my patience,</LINE>
<LINE>I then did ask of her her changeling child;</LINE>
<LINE>Which straight she gave me, and her fairy sent</LINE>
<LINE>To bear him to my bower in fairy land.</LINE>
<LINE>And now I have the boy, I will undo</LINE>
<LINE>This hateful imperfection of her eyes.</LINE>
<LINE>And, gentle Puck, take this transformed scalp</LINE>
<LINE>From off the head of this Athenian swain,</LINE>
<LINE>That he, awaking when the other do,</LINE>
<LINE>May all to Athens back again repair,</LINE>
<LINE>And think no more of this night&#8217;s accidents</LINE>
<LINE>But as the fierce vexation of a dream.</LINE>
<LINE>But first I will release the Fairy Queen.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>HIP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I was with Hercules and Cadmus once,</LINE>
<LINE>When in a wood of Crete they bay&#8217;d the bear</LINE>
<LINE>With hounds of Sparta. Never did I hear</LINE>
<LINE>Such gallant chiding; for besides the groves,</LINE>
<LINE>The skies, the fountains, every region near</LINE>
<LINE>Seem all one mutual cry. I never heard</LINE>
<LINE>So musical a discord, such sweet thunder.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My hounds are bred out of the Spartan kind;</LINE>
<LINE>So flew&#8217;d, so sanded; and their heads are hung</LINE>
<LINE>With ears that sweep away the morning dew;</LINE>
<LINE>Crook-knee&#8217;d, and dewlapp&#8217;d like Thessalian bulls;</LINE>
<LINE>Slow in pursuit; but match&#8217;d in mouth like bells,</LINE>
<LINE>Each under each. A cry more tuneable</LINE>
<LINE>Was never hollow&#8217;d to, nor cheer&#8217;d with horn,</LINE>
<LINE>In Crete, in Sparta, nor in Thessaly.</LINE>
<LINE>Judge when you hear. But soft! What nymphs are these?</LINE>

<LINE>My lord, this&#8217; my daughter here asleep,</LINE>

<LINE>My lord, I shall reply amazedly,</LINE>

<LINE>But, as I think&#8212;for truly would I speak,</LINE>
<LINE>And now I do bethink me, so it is&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>I came with Hermia hither. Our intent</LINE>

<LINE>(Melted as the snow) seems to me now</LINE>
<LINE>As the remembrance of an idle gaud,</LINE>
<LINE>Which in my childhood I did dote upon;</LINE>
<LINE>And all the faith, the virtue of my heart,</LINE>
<LINE>The object and the pleasure of mine eye,</LINE>
<LINE>Is only Helena. To her, my lord,</LINE>
<LINE>Was I betrothed ere I saw Hermia;</LINE>
<LINE>But like a sickness did I loathe this food;</LINE>
<LINE>But, as in health, come to my natural taste,</LINE>
<LINE>Now I do wish it, love it, long for it,</LINE>
<LINE>And will forevermore be true to it.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fair lovers, you are fortunately met;</LINE>
<LINE>Of this discourse we more will hear anon.</LINE>
<LINE>Egeus, I will overbear your will;</LINE>
<LINE>For in the temple, by and by, with us</LINE>
<LINE>These couples shall eternally be knit.</LINE>
<LINE>And, for the morning now is something worn,</LINE>
<LINE>Our purpos&#8217;d hunting shall be set aside.</LINE>
<LINE>Away with us to Athens. Three and three,</LINE>
<LINE>We&#8217;ll hold a feast in great solemnity.</LINE>
<LINE>Come, Hippolyta.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt Theseus, Hippolyta, Egeus, and Train.</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>These things seem small and undistinguishable,</LINE>

<SPEAKER>DEM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">Are you sure</LINE>
<LINE>That we are awake? It seems to me</LINE>
<LINE>That yet we sleep, we dream. Do not you think</LINE>
<LINE>The Duke was here, and bid us follow him?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yea, and my father.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DEM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why then, we are awake. Let&#8217;s follow him,</LINE>
<LINE>And by the way let&#8217;s recount our dreams.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Awaking.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>When my cue comes, call me, and I will answer. My next is, &#8220;Most fair Pyramus.&#8221; Heigh-ho! Peter Quince! Flute the bellows-mender! Snout the tinker! Starveling! God&#8217;s my life, stol&#8217;n hence, and left me asleep! I have had a most rare vision. I have had a dream, past the wit of man to say what dream it was. Man is but an ass, if he go about t&#8217; expound this dream. Methought I was&#8212;there is no man can tell what. Methought I was, and methought I had&#8212;but man is but a patch&#8217;d fool, if he will offer to say what methought I had. The eye of man hath not heard, the ear of man hath not seen, man&#8217;s hand is not able to taste, his tongue to conceive, nor his heart to report, what my dream was. I will get Peter Quince to write a ballet of this dream. It shall be call&#8217;d &#8220;Bottom&#8217;s Dream,&#8221; because it hath no bottom; and I will sing it in the latter end of a play, before the Duke. Peradventure, to make it the more gracious, I shall sing it at her death.</LINE>

<LINE>It is not possible. You have not a man in all Athens able to discharge Pyramus but he.</LINE>

<LINE>No, he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft man in Athens.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>SNUG.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Masters, the Duke is coming from the temple, and there is two or three lords and ladies more married. If our sport had gone forward, we had all been made men.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FLU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O sweet bully Bottom! Thus hath he lost sixpence a day during his life; he could not have scap&#8217;d sixpence a day. And the Duke had not given him sixpence a day for playing Pyramus, I&#8217;ll be hang&#8217;d. He would have deserv&#8217;d it. Sixpence a day in Pyramus, or nothing.</LINE>

<LINE>Masters, I am to discourse wonders; but ask me not what; for if I tell you, I am no true Athenian. I will tell you every thing, right as it fell out.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUIN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let us hear, sweet Bottom.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BOT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not a word of me. All that I will tell you is, that the Duke hath din&#8217;d. Get your apparel together, good strings to your beards, new ribands to your pumps; meet presently at the palace; every man look o&#8217;er his part; for the short and the long is, our play is preferr&#8217;d. In any case, let Thisby have clean linen; and let not him that plays the lion pare his nails, for they shall hang out for the lion&#8217;s claws. And, most dear actors, eat no onions nor garlic, for we are to utter sweet breath; and I do not doubt but to hear them say, it is a sweet comedy. No more words. Away, go, away!</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HIP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis strange, my Theseus, that these lovers speak of.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>More strange than true. I never may believe</LINE>
<LINE>These antic fables, nor these fairy toys.</LINE>
<LINE>Lovers and madmen have such seething brains,</LINE>
<LINE>Such shaping fantasies, that apprehend</LINE>
<LINE>More than cool reason ever comprehends.</LINE>
<LINE>The lunatic, the lover, and the poet</LINE>
<LINE>Are of imagination all compact.</LINE>
<LINE>One sees more devils than vast hell can hold;</LINE>
<LINE>That is the madman. The lover, all as frantic,</LINE>
<LINE>Sees Helen&#8217;s beauty in a brow of Egypt.</LINE>
<LINE>The poet&#8217;s eye, in a fine frenzy rolling,</LINE>
<LINE>Doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven;</LINE>
<LINE>And as imagination bodies forth</LINE>
<LINE>The forms of things unknown, the poet&#8217;s pen</LINE>
<LINE>Turns them to shapes, and gives to aery nothing</LINE>
<LINE>A local habitation and a name.</LINE>
<LINE>Such tricks hath strong imagination,</LINE>
<LINE>That if it would but apprehend some joy,</LINE>
<LINE>It comprehends some bringer of that joy;</LINE>
<LINE>Or in the night, imagining some fear,</LINE>
<LINE>How easy is a bush suppos&#8217;d a bear!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HIP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But all the story of the night told over,</LINE>
<LINE>And all their minds transfigur&#8217;d so together,</LINE>
<LINE>More witnesseth than fancy&#8217;s images,</LINE>
<LINE>And grows to something of great constancy;</LINE>
<LINE>But howsoever, strange and admirable.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter lovers, Lysander, Demetrius, Hermia, and Helena.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>

<LINE><RECITE>By an Athenian eunuch to the harp.&#8221;</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE>We&#8217;ll none of that: that have I told my love,</LINE>
<LINE>In glory of my kinsman Hercules.</LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>&#8220;The riot of the tipsy Bacchanals,</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>Tearing the Thracian singer in their rage.&#8221;</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE>That is an old device; and it was play&#8217;d</LINE>

<LINE><RECITE>&#8220;The thrice three Muses mourning for the death</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>Of Learning, late deceas&#8217;d in beggary.&#8221;</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE>That is some satire, keen and critical,</LINE>
<LINE>Not sorting with a nuptial ceremony.</LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>&#8220;A tedious brief scene of young Pyramus</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>And his love Thisby; very tragical mirth.&#8221;</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE>Merry and tragical? Tedious and brief?</LINE>
<LINE>That is hot ice and wondrous strange snow.</LINE>
<LINE>How shall we find the concord of this discord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PHIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A play there is, my lord, some ten words long,</LINE>
<LINE>Which is as brief as I have known a play;</LINE>
<LINE>But by ten words, my lord, it is too long,</LINE>
<LINE>Which makes it tedious; for in all the play</LINE>
<LINE>There is not one word apt, one player fitted.</LINE>
<LINE>And tragical, my noble lord, it is;</LINE>
<LINE>For Pyramus therein doth kill himself;</LINE>
<LINE>Which when I saw rehears&#8217;d, I must confess,</LINE>
<LINE>Made mine eyes water; but more merry tears</LINE>
<LINE>The passion of loud laughter never shed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What are they that do play it?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PHIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hard-handed men that work in Athens here,</LINE>
<LINE>Which never labor&#8217;d in their minds till now;</LINE>
<LINE>And now have toiled their unbreathed memories</LINE>
<LINE>With this same play, against your nuptial.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And we will hear it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PHIL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">No, my noble lord,</LINE>
<LINE>It is not for you. I have heard it over,</LINE>
<LINE>And it is nothing, nothing in the world;</LINE>
<LINE>Unless you can find sport in their intents,</LINE>
<LINE>Extremely stretch&#8217;d, and conn&#8217;d with cruel pain,</LINE>
<LINE>To do you service.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">I will hear that play;</LINE>

<LINE>Why, gentle sweet, you shall see no such thing.</LINE>

<LINE>The kinder we, to give them thanks for nothing.</LINE>
<LINE>Our sport shall be to take what they mistake;</LINE>

<LINE>Where I have come, great clerks have purposed</LINE>
<LINE>To greet me with premeditated welcomes;</LINE>
<LINE>Where I have seen them shiver and look pale,</LINE>
<LINE>Make periods in the midst of sentences,</LINE>
<LINE>Throttle their practic&#8217;d accent in their fears,</LINE>
<LINE>And in conclusion dumbly have broke off,</LINE>
<LINE>Not paying me a welcome. Trust me, sweet,</LINE>
<LINE>Out of this silence yet I pick&#8217;d a welcome;</LINE>
<LINE>And in the modesty of fearful duty</LINE>
<LINE>I read as much as from the rattling tongue</LINE>

<LINE>That is the true beginning of our end.</LINE>
<LINE>Consider then, we come but in despite.</LINE>
<LINE>We do not come, as minding to content you,</LINE>
<LINE>Our true intent is. All for your delight</LINE>
<LINE>We are not here. That you should here repent you,</LINE>
<LINE>The actors are at hand; and, by their show,</LINE>
<LINE>You shall know all, that you are like to know.</LINE>

<LINE>This fellow doth not stand upon points.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LYS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He hath rid his prologue like a rough colt; he knows not the stop. A good moral, my lord: it is not enough to speak, but to speak true.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HIP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Indeed he hath play&#8217;d on this prologue like a child on a recorder&#8212;a sound, but not in government.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>His speech was like a tangled chain; nothing impair&#8217;d, but all disorder&#8217;d. Who is next?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter with a Trumpet before them Pyramus and Thisby and Wall and Moonshine and Lion.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Gentles, perchance you wonder at this show;</LINE>
<LINE>But wonder on till truth make all things plain.</LINE>
<LINE>This man is Pyramus, if you would know;</LINE>
<LINE>This beauteous lady Thisby is certain.</LINE>
<LINE>This man, with lime and rough-cast, doth present</LINE>
<LINE>Wall, that vile Wall, which did these lovers sunder;</LINE>
<LINE>And through Wall&#8217;s chink, poor souls, they are content</LINE>
<LINE>To whisper. At the which let no man wonder.</LINE>
<LINE>This man, with lantern, dog, and bush of thorn,</LINE>
<LINE>Presenteth Moonshine; for if you will know,</LINE>
<LINE>By moonshine did these lovers think no scorn</LINE>
<LINE>To meet at Ninus&#8217; tomb, there, there to woo.</LINE>
<LINE>This grisly beast, which Lion hight by name,</LINE>
<LINE>The trusty Thisby, coming first by night,</LINE>
<LINE>Did scare away, or rather did affright;</LINE>
<LINE>And as she fled, her mantle she did fall,</LINE>
<LINE>Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain.</LINE>
<LINE>Anon comes Pyramus, sweet youth and tall,</LINE>
<LINE>And finds his trusty Thisby&#8217;s mantle slain;</LINE>
<LINE>Whereat, with blade, with bloody blameful blade,</LINE>
<LINE>He bravely broach&#8217;d his boiling bloody breast;</LINE>
<LINE>And Thisby, tarrying in mulberry shade,</LINE>
<LINE>His dagger drew, and died. For all the rest,</LINE>
<LINE>Let Lion, Moonshine, Wall, and lovers twain</LINE>
<LINE>At large discourse, while here they do remain.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit with Pyramus, Thisby, Lion, and Moonshine.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEAKER>WALL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In this same enterlude it doth befall</LINE>
<LINE>That I, one Snout by name, present a wall;</LINE>
<LINE>And such a wall, as I would have you think,</LINE>
<LINE>That had in it a crannied hole or chink,</LINE>
<LINE>Through which the lovers, Pyramus and Thisby,</LINE>
<LINE>Did whisper often, very secretly.</LINE>
<LINE>This loam, this rough-cast, and this stone doth show</LINE>
<LINE>That I am that same wall; the truth is so;</LINE>
<LINE>And this the cranny is, right and sinister,</LINE>
<LINE>Through which the fearful lovers are to whisper.</LINE>

<LINE>No, in truth, sir, he should not. &#8220;Deceiving me&#8221; is Thisby&#8217;s cue. She is to enter now, and I am to spy her through the wall. You shall see it will fall pat as I told you. Yonder she comes.</LINE>

<LINE>The smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor,</LINE>
<LINE>May now, perchance, both quake and tremble here,</LINE>
<LINE>When lion rough in wildest rage doth roar.</LINE>
<LINE>Then know that I as Snug the joiner am</LINE>
<LINE>A lion fell, nor else no lion&#8217;s dam,</LINE>
<LINE>For, if I should, as lion, come in strife</LINE>
<LINE>Into this place, &#8217;twere pity on my life.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A very gentle beast, and of a good conscience.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DEM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The very best at a beast, my lord, that e&#8217;er I saw.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LYS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This lion is a very fox for his valor.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>True; and a goose for his discretion.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DEM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not so, my lord; for his valor cannot carry his discretion, and the fox carries the goose.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>His discretion, I am sure, cannot carry his valor; for the goose carries not the fox. It is well; leave it to his discretion, and let us listen to the Moon.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MOON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This lanthorn doth the horned moon present&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DEM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He should have worn the horns on his head.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He is no crescent, and his horns are invisible within the circumference.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MOON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This lanthorn doth the horned moon present;</LINE>
<LINE>Myself the man i&#8217; th&#8217; moon do seem to be.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This is the greatest error of all the rest. The man should be put into the lanthorn. How is it else the man i&#8217; th&#8217; moon?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DEM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He dares not come there for the candle; for, you see, it is already in snuff.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HIP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am a-weary of this moon. Would he would change!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It appears, by his small light of discretion, that he is in the wane; but yet in courtesy, in all reason, we must stay the time.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LYS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Proceed, Moon.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MOON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>All that I have to say is to tell you that the lanthorn is the moon, I the man i&#8217; th&#8217; moon, this thorn-bush my thorn-bush, and this dog my dog.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DEM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, all these should be in the lanthorn; for all these are in the moon. But silence! Here comes Thisby.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Thisby.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THIS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This is old Ninny&#8217;s tomb. Where is my love?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LION.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>The Lion roars. Thisby runs off.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DEM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well roar&#8217;d, Lion.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well run, Thisby.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HIP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well shone, Moon. Truly, the moon shines with a good grace.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>The Lion shakes Thisby&#8217;s mantle.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well mous&#8217;d, Lion.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Pyramus.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DEM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And then came Pyramus.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit Lion.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LYS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And so the lion vanish&#8217;d.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PYR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sweet Moon, I thank thee for thy sunny beams;</LINE>
<LINE>I thank thee, Moon, for shining now so bright;</LINE>
<LINE>For by thy gracious, golden, glittering gleams,</LINE>
<LINE>I trust to take of truest Thisby sight.</LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>But stay! O spite!</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>But mark, poor knight,</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>What dreadful dole is here!</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>Eyes, do you see?</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>How can it be?</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>O dainty duck! O dear!</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>Thy mantle good,</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>What, stain&#8217;d with blood?</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>Approach, ye Furies fell!</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>O Fates, come, come,</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>Cut thread and thrum,</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>Quail, crush, conclude, and quell!</RECITE></LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This passion, and the death of a dear friend, would go near to make a man look sad.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HIP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Beshrew my heart, but I pity the man.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PYR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, wherefore, Nature, didst thou lions frame?</LINE>
<LINE>Since lion vild hath here deflow&#8217;r&#8217;d my dear;</LINE>
<LINE>Which is&#8212;no, no&#8212;which was the fairest dame</LINE>
<LINE>That liv&#8217;d, that lov&#8217;d, that lik&#8217;d, that look&#8217;d with cheer.</LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>Come, tears, confound,</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>Out, sword, and wound</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>The pap of Pyramus;</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>Ay, that left pap,</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>Where heart doth hop.</RECITE></LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Stabs himself.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE><RECITE>Thus die I, thus, thus, thus.</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>Now am I dead,</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>Now am I fled;</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>My soul is in the sky.</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>Tongue, lose thy light,</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>Moon, take thy flight,</RECITE></LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exit Moonshine.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE><RECITE>Now die, die, die, die, die.</RECITE></LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Dies.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DEM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No die, but an ace, for him; for he is but one.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LYS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Less than an ace, man; for he is dead, he is nothing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>With the help of a surgeon he might yet recover, and yet prove an ass.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HIP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How chance Moonshine is gone before Thisby comes back and finds her lover?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Thisby.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She will find him by starlight. Here she comes, and her passion ends the play.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HIP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Methinks she should not use a long one for such a Pyramus. I hope she will be brief.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DEM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A mote will turn the balance, which Pyramus, which Thisby, is the better: he for a man. God warr&#8217;nt us; she for a woman. God bless us.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LYS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She hath spied him already with those sweet eyes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DEM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And thus she means, videlicet&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THIS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE><RECITE>Asleep, my love?</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>What, dead, my dove?</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>O Pyramus, arise!</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>Speak, speak! Quite dumb?</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>Dead, dead? A tomb</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>Must cover thy sweet eyes.</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>These lily lips,</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>This cherry nose,</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>These yellow cowslip cheeks,</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>Are gone, are gone!</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>Lovers, make moan;</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>His eyes were green as leeks.</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>O Sisters Three,</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>Come, come to me,</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>With hands as pale as milk;</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>Lay them in gore,</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>Since you have shore</RECITE></LINE>

<LINE><RECITE>Tongue, not a word!</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>Come, trusty sword,</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>Come, blade, my breast imbrue!</RECITE></LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Stabs herself.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE><RECITE>And farewell, friends;</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>Thus Thisby ends;</RECITE></LINE>

</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Dies.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Moonshine and Lion are left to bury the dead.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DEM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, and Wall too.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BOT.</SPEAKER>
<STAGEDIR>Starting up.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>No, I assure you, the wall is down that parted their fathers. Will it please you to see the epilogue, or to hear a Bergomask dance between two of our company?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>THE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No epilogue, I pray you; for your play needs no excuse. Never excuse; for when the players are all dead, there need none to be blam&#8217;d. Marry, if he that writ it had play&#8217;d Pyramus, and hang&#8217;d himself in Thisby&#8217;s garter, it would have been a fine tragedy; and so it is, truly, and very notably discharg&#8217;d. But come, your Bergomask; let your epilogue alone.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>A dance.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>The iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve.</LINE>
<LINE>Lovers, to bed, &#8217;tis almost fairy time.</LINE>
<LINE>I fear we shall outsleep the coming morn</LINE>
<LINE>As much as we this night have overwatch&#8217;d.</LINE>
<LINE>This palpable-gross play hath well beguil&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>The heavy gait of night. Sweet friends, to bed.</LINE>
<LINE>A fortnight hold we this solemnity,</LINE>
<LINE>In nightly revels and new jollity.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt.</STAGEDIR>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Puck.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PUCK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE type="lyric">Now the hungry lion roars,</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">And the wolf behowls the moon;</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">Whilst the heavy ploughman snores,</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">All with weary task foredone.</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">Now the wasted brands do glow,</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">Whilst the screech owl, screeching loud,</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">Puts the wretch that lies in woe</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">In remembrance of a shroud.</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">Now it is the time of night</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">That the graves, all gaping wide,</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">Every one lets forth his sprite,</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">In the church-way paths to glide.</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">And we fairies, that do run</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">By the triple Hecat&#8217;s team</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">From the presence of the sun,</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">Following darkness like a dream,</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">Now are frolic. Not a mouse</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">Shall disturb this hallowed house.</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">I am sent with broom before,</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">To sweep the dust behind the door.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter King and Queen of Fairies, Oberon and Titania, with all their Train.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OBE.</SPEAKER>

<LINE type="lyric">Every elf and fairy sprite</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">Hop as light as bird from brier,</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">And this ditty, after me,</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">Sing, and dance it trippingly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TITA.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>First, rehearse your song by rote,</LINE>
<LINE>To each word a warbling note.</LINE>
<LINE>Hand in hand, with fairy grace,</LINE>
<LINE>Will we sing, and bless this place.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Song and dance.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OBE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE type="lyric">Now, until the break of day,</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">Through this house each fairy stray.</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">To the best bride-bed will we,</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">Which by us shall blessed be;</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">And the issue, there create,</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">Ever shall be fortunate.</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">So shall all the couples three</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">Ever true in loving be;</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">And the blots of Nature&#8217;s hand</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">Shall not in their issue stand;</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">Never mole, hare-lip, nor scar,</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">Nor mark prodigious, such as are</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">Despised in nativity,</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">Shall upon their children be.</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">With this field-dew consecrate,</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">Every fairy take his gait,</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">And each several chamber bless,</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">Through this palace, with sweet peace,</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">And the owner of it blest</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">Ever shall in safety rest.</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">Trip away; make no stay;</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">Meet me all by break of day.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt Oberon, Titania, and Train.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PUCK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE type="lyric">If we shadows have offended,</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">Think but this, and all is mended,</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">That you have but slumb&#8217;red here</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">While these visions did appear.</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">And this weak and idle theme,</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">No more yielding but a dream,</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">Gentles, do not reprehend.</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">If you pardon, we will mend.</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">And, as I am an honest Puck,</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">If we have unearned luck</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">Now to scape the serpent&#8217;s tongue,</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">We will make amends ere long;</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">Else the Puck a liar call.</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">So, good night unto you all.</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">Give me your hands, if we be friends,</LINE>
<LINE type="lyric">And Robin shall restore amends.</LINE>
