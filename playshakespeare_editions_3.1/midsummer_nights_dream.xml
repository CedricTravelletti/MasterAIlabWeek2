<persona gender="male">
<persname short="THE.">Theseus, Duke of Athens</persname>
<persdescription>Theseus, the Duke of Athens, has recently won a war against the Amazons, and to reward himself for his victory is going to marry their queen Hippolyta, whether she likes it or not. This is not the first time he has ravished a woman, and he has also at times loved and then abandoned others. Though he is reasonably sympathetic to Hermia&#8217;s conundrum, he insists on upholding the law as he knows it rather than making any exceptions. He nevertheless does not fully approve of how Egeus and Demetrius act. He enjoys hunting and has a taste for listening to his hounds bark to the echo. He is not above teasing young folks found sleeping in the wood, and uses his authority against Egeus once Demetrius renounces his claim on Hermia. He is not imaginative, or at least he is enough of a rationalist to disbelieve the truth of strange tales. He has an affection for his more simple subjects and their unpracticed efforts to please him. What happens on the morning of his wedding to Hippolyta can be discovered in <persnameref>The Two Noble Kinsmen</persnameref>.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="EGE.">Egeus</persname>
<persdescription>Egeus is a courtier at Theseus&#8217;s court and his master of revels. A sterling defender of old-fashioned patriarchy, he intends either to have his daughter Hermia marry the man he choose or to execute her. He has no fondness at all for Lysander, who shows him scant respect, and calls for him to be prosecuted when he finds Hermia with him in the woods, but he must accept Theseus&#8217;s decision to the contrary. He presents the various entertainment options for the evening of the wedding, discouraging as best he can the Duke from choosing the Mechanicals&#8217; play.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="LYS.">Lysander</persname>
<persdescription>Lysander is a young man of Athens, of good family and fortune. He has a mocking tongue on him. In love with Hermia, he convinces her to flee with him to the house of his aunt, who dotes on him, and who lives outside the reach of Athenian law. He gets them lost in the woods on their way, to the extent that they need to sleep. He rather hopes to cuddle up with Hermia, but she will have none of it and sends him to sleep on his own. Awakening with Puck&#8217;s love juice in his eyes just in time to see Helena, he begins to make extravagant love to her. He enters a bitter rivalry with Demetrius over her, insults Hermia, and rushes off to fight a duel with the other man. Once Puck makes all well, he can scarcely tell just what has happened to him.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="DEM.">Demetrius</persname>
<persdescription>Demetrius is not the most admirable of young men. Having wooed Helena and won her heart, he shifts his attentions to Hermia, who will have none of him, but whose father favors him. Told by Helena of Hermia and Lysander&#8217;s flight, he follows them to the woods, though deeply irritated by his inability to shake Helena from his coattails. He threatens her with abandonment and possibly molestation, but to no avail. His attempts to woo Hermia as she distraughtly seeks Lysander are no more successful. When Puck&#8217;s love juice makes him fall in love with Helena, he is as extravagant as Lysander in his praises of her, and runs off to fight a duel with the other man for her sake. When the lovers wake with their senses restored, he admits to Theseus that he is in love with Helena, and that he was contracted to her before he ever tried to make a match with Hermia.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="PHIL.">Philostrate</persname>
<persdescription>Philostrate is Theseus&#8217;s Master of the Revels. The Duke sends him to encourage everybody in Athens to celebrate his wedding and have a festive time during the four days leading up to the ceremony. He brings Theseus the list of possible entertainments. Unimpressed by the Mechanicals&#8217; play, he unsccessfully attempts to dissuade Theseus from choosing it.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="QUIN., PRO.">Quince</persname>
<persdescription>Peter Quince is a carpenter with literary pretensions who organizes some fellow workers into preparing a play he has written to present to Theseus and Hippolyta on their wedding day (in which he presents the Prologue). He is well-respected by his fellows, and Bottom sets great store by his writing abilities. He is able to keep Bottom under at least some control.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="BOT.">Bottom</persname>
<persaliases>
	<persname short="PYR.">Pyramus</persname>
</persaliases>
<persdescription>Bottom the weaver is a take-charge sort of fellow, and a great stage ham who wishes to play all the parts he can in Quince&#8217;s play. In the end, he agrees to stick to Pyramus only. Beyond this, he finds some problems in the script and suggests the way to mend them. Given an ass&#8217;s head by Puck, he does not realize it in the faintest. Despite his stagey pretensions, he is an honest, down-to-earth man, and though confused by Titania&#8217;s intention is perfectly courteous and friendly to the fairies she set to serve him. He talks enough that Titania has the fairies render him dumb. He is more interested in having a good meal, listening to rural music, conversing with the fairies and having a nap than sleeping with Titania. Waking back in his normal form, he recalls his night as a dream of such intensity that he wishes to have Quince turn it to a ballad. He is beloved by his fellows.</persdescription>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="FLU.">Flute</persname>
<persaliases>
	<persname short="THIS.">Thisbe</persname>
</persaliases>
<persdescription>Flute is a bellows-mender, a young man whose facial hair is only just beginning to grow. His voice may be unbroken. He accepts to play Thisbe in Quince&#8217;s play despite not wishing to play a woman.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="SNOUT.">Snout</persname>
<persaliases>
	<persname short="WALL.">Wall</persname>
</persaliases>
<persdescription>Snout is a tinker cast as Pyramus&#8217;s father and the Wall in Quince&#8217;s play. He is cautious about the possibility of displeasing his social betters, and finds several grounds on which to tinker with the play.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="SNUG.">Snug</persname>
<persaliases>
	<persname short="LION.">Lion</persname>
</persaliases>
<persdescription>Snug the joiner is not the most quick-witted of fellows, and is therefore cast as the lion to avoid his having to learn lines. To satisfy Snout and Bottom&#8217;s concerns of frightening the ladies of the court, however, he is given eight lines to reassure them that he is not, in fact, a lion.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="STAR.">Starveling</persname>
<persaliases>
	<persname short="MOON.">Moonshine</persname>
</persaliases>
<persdescription>Starveling the tailor portrays Moonshine in Quince&#8217;s play. He is interrupted by the courtiers&#8217; comments, and in the end merely summarizes his speech rather than giving it.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="female">
<persname short="HIP.">Hippolyta</persname>
<persdescription>Hippolyta is Queen of the Amazons. Having been defeated in battle by Theseus, she is now betrothed to him. Being an Amazon, it is to be expected that she is a great huntress, and that she will enjoy the sound of the baying of Theseus&#8217;s hounds, which he intends to have her hear during the hunt. She warns him that her standards for such concerts are high. She is more convinced by the lovers&#8217; tale than Theseus is, pointing to the evidence of their change of heart. She has no taste for the humiliation of her inferiors, but she is also blunt and unable to hide her opinion of the Mechanicals&#8217; play. She reappears in <persnameref>The Two Noble Kinsmen</persnameref>.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="female">
<persname short="HER.">Hermia</persname>
<persdescription>Hermia is Egeus&#8217;s daughter. In love with Lysander, she refuses to marry Demetrius despite the threat of death for her refusal. She speaks up to praise Lysander to the Duke, and swears to live a nun rather than marry Demetrius. She agrees to run away with her lover to his aunt&#8217;s, beyond the reach of Athenian law. Lost in the forest on the way, she is demure and insists that Lysander not sleep next to her, which ends up causing no end of trouble. Waking to find him gone, she is frightened that Demetrius may have killed him, and rants at him in fine fashion. She has always had a fierce temper. She is darkish of skin, short, and has bright eyes. She and Helena were inseparable friends as children, and it is only the misfortune of Demetrius&#8217;s misplaced love that has separated them; this leads her to believe that Helena is part of a prank being pulled on her by all three of the others when Puck makes a mess of things.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="female">
<persname short="HEL.">Helena</persname>
<persdescription>Helena is a young lady of Athens. She was wooed by Demetrius and remains obsessively, even masochistically in love with him. Fair-skinned and tall, she feels very put-upon and mopes a great deal, but not without good reason. When Hermia and Lysander tell her of their plan to run away, she decides to betray them to Demetrius simply because this will give her a chance to see him again. Despite her deep childhood friendship with Hermia, she is willing to believe the worst of her when she thinks herself mocked. She runs away from the others to return to Athens, but needs to rest on the way. Come morning, Demetrius is in love with her again, and all is well.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="OBE.">Oberon</persname>
<persdescription>Oberon is King of Fairies. Proud, angry, and vengeful, he quarrels with Titania for the sake of a changeling boy, and on being refused decides to humiliate her into obedience. He is interested enough in mortals to decide to make happy a lovelorn girl passing by at the time that he hits on this idea for forging a reconciliation with his Queen. He is fond of Puck, but not blind to his anarchic tendencies, and suspects him of causing the lovers&#8217; confusion willfully. He drugs Titania in her sleep to make her fall in love with some monstrous creature, and uses her infatuation to take the changeling boy from her. Having done so, he removes his spell and reconciles himself with her. They then go to bless Theseus&#8217;s house on his wedding night, promising good fortune to all the wedded couples.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="female">
<persname short="TITA.">Titania</persname>
<persdescription>Titania is Queen of Fairies. Her quarrel with Oberon disturbs nature, but in memory of her votaress she still refuses to give up the boy who is at the quarrel&#8217;s root. Charmed by Oberon, she is entranced by Bottom in his transformed shape, she promises him the world to have him stay by her, though she has him charmed dumb when he spends too much time chatting to the attendants she gives him. She is so besotted that when Oberon asks her for the changeling boy again, she gives him up without a second thought. With the charm taken off her, she is reconciled with Oberon, and goes with him to bless Theseus&#8217;s house on his wedding night. She is proud, obstinate, and careful of her duties, and faithful to the memory of a dead mortal friend.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="PUCK.">Puck</persname>
<persdescription>Puck, or Robin Goodfellow, is an amoral prankster of a spirit. Oberon&#8217;s jester, he delights in practical jokes, transforming Bottom for a lark and making him the object of Titania&#8217;s love. When he makes a mistake in carrying out Oberon&#8217;s commands, he is not repentant, and merely enjoys the greater chaos he has caused. He can counterfeit the voices of humans to perfection, can blacken the night, and is occasionally used by Oberon as a janitor.</persdescription>

<scenedescription>Duke Theseus orders Philostrate to stir up merriment in the streets of Athens before his wedding to Hippolyta, the Queen of the Amazons he defeated in battle. Egeus brings in his daughter Hermia in order to ask the Duke to force her to marry Demetrius, his choice for her husband. Hermia is insisting on marrying Lysander instead, and Egeus begs permission to either force her to wed Demetrius, or to have her killed, as is his right by the law. Theseus gives Hermia until his own wedding to either give in or become a nun. Lysander argues his case, pointing out that he is in all ways equal to Demetrius and that the latter had earlier promised to marry Helena, but Theseus will not go against the law. Left alone, the two lovers lament their fate. Lysander comes up with a plan to flee to an aunt of his, who lives outside the boundaries of Athens and where they could therefore be safely married. They tell this plan to Helena, who is lovesick for Demetrius. Learning that the two runaways will be meeting in the wood that night, she decides to tell Demetrius, in the hopes of winning his favor.</scenedescription>

<scenedescription>Next night. Robin Goodfellow, the Puck, meets a fairy, and learns that Titania, Queen of the Fairies, is coming to the very place where Oberon, the King, is planning to hold his revels. He explains that there is a great quarrel between the two over a changeling boy. The two monarchs enter and meet, immediately renewing the quarrel, accusing each other of infidelity with Theseus and Hippolyta respectively. Titania absolutely refuses to hand over the changeling to Oberon, explaining that the boy&#8217;s mother was one of her votaresses. Furious, Oberon decides on revenge, and sends Puck to fetch a flower that will enable him to make Titania fall in love with an animal until she gives up the changeling. At this point he sees Demetrius, who is searching through the woods for Lysander and Hermia and is being dogged by Helena, who absolutely refuses to leave him, no matter how badly he treats her. Oberon decides that he will use some of the juice from the flower to make Demetrius love her. When Puck returns with the flower, Oberon gives him some of the juice and orders him to find the Athenian man and drip it in his eyes.</scenedescription>

<scenedescription>Titania lies herself down to sleep, lulled by the charms sung by her attendant fairies. When they leave, Oberon sneaks up on his queen and pours the love-juice into her eyes. The weary Lysander and Hermia appear, and exhaustedly decide to sleep. Hermia insists that Lysander lie a little away from her, for decency&#8217;s sake. They fall asleep, and Puck, passing by, believes that he has finally found the Athenian he has been ordered to enchant, and therefore puts his love-juice on Lysander&#8217;s eyes. Demetrius, still searching, is distracted by still being followed by Helena, and misses his prey as he shakes her off. She sees Lysander, who is sleeping so deeply she is afraid he is dead. Finally, she manages to wake him, and, under the charm of the love-juice, he instantly falls head over heels in love with her. She is convinced that he is mocking her, and deeply hurt. She leaves, and he pursues her, abandoning Hermia, who awakes to find herself alone and decides to seek for him.</scenedescription>

<scenedescription>Bottom and the others meet to rehearse, not knowing that they are near Titania&#8217;s bower, and begin to work out difficulties in the script. Fearful of offending or scaring the ladies at court, they decide to add a prologue to the play, explaining that the lion is not a real one. Likewise, parts for Moonshine and the Wall are added and assigned. As they begin to go through the play, Puck happens upon them, and is vastly amused. Seeing a chance to play mischief, he waits until Bottom exits and changes his head into a donkey&#8217;s; when Bottom returns, the others fly in fear, pushed on by Puck. Bottom stolidly believes that they are playing a practical joke on him, not even noticing his transformation. Refusing to play along, he sits down and sings to himself making a racket that wakes Titania – who seeing him, instantly falls in love with him. She begins to woo him, while he, with great common sense, declines to see any truth in her flowery compliments. She calls in fairies to attend on him, and has him led into her bower.</scenedescription>

<line form="prose">Ay; or else one must come in with a bush of thorns and a lantern, and say he comes to disfigure, or to present, the person of Moonshine. Then, there is another thing: we must have a wall in the great chamber; for Pyramus and Thisby (says the story) did talk through the chink of a wall.</line>

<scenepersonae>(Oberon, Puck, Demetrius, Hermia, Lysander, Helena)</scenepersonae>
<scenedescription>Puck reports to Oberon that Titania has fallen for a half-man, half-ass, and Oberon is delighted with this development. Puck also claims to have fulfilled the order to charm the Athenian, but as Demetrius and Hermia enter, it becomes apparent that he got the wrong man. Demetrius begs Hermia to grant him her favor, but Hermia can think only of Lysander. She leaves him, and, disconsolate, he lies down to sleep. Oberon is furious and suspects that Puck has done this deliberately, but Puck points out that Oberon didn&#8217;t exactly describe Demetrius very well. Oberon tells him to find Helena, and while he is gone puts love-juice on Demetrius&#8217;s eyes. Lysander and Helena latter, he wooing her loudly, she rejecting him, and the noise wakes Demetrius, who seeing her is instantly enamored. Helena is even more convinced that a cruel prank is being played on her. As the two men quarrel, Hermia enters, searching for Lysander, and is appalled to find him rejecting her. Helena immediately believes that Hermia is in on the prank, while Hermia soon comes to believe that Helena has seduced Lysander, and a general fight breaks out. Lysander and Demetrius exit to duel, while the ladies go their separate ways. Oberon orders Puck to make things right by distracting the men during their fight and finding an occasion to use an antidote to the love-juice on Lysander. Imitating both their voices, Puck keeps them from meeting each other, until they are exhausted and lie down to sleep. The ladies too come and lie down nearby, and Puck applies the antidote to Lysander&#8217;s eyes.</scenedescription>

<line form="verse">An ass&#8217;s nole I fixed on his head.</line>
<line form="verse">Anon his Thisby must be answered,</line>

<line form="verse">Made senseless things begin to do them wrong,</line>

<scenedescription>Titania continues to make Bottom as comfortable as she can, having food brought to him and any sort of music he cares for. They lie down and sleep, and Puck and Oberon approach. Oberon reveals that he easily gained custody of the changeling from the distracted Titania, and is now ready to remove the enchantment from her, which he does. The couple are reconciled, and plan to bless Theseus&#8217;s house after his wedding, while Puck removes the ass-head from Bottom. The fairies leave, and the lovers are discovered sleeping on the ground by Theseus and his court, who are out hunting. Waking the four with hunting horns, Theseus mocks them before asking how it is that they are now all in amity. The four cannot explain, feeling that everything that has passed was simply a dream, but Demetrius insists he is now in love with Helena, and Theseus rejects Egeus&#8217;s call for punishment on Lysander. The four reassure each other that they are awake now and follow the court. Bottom wakes, and considers the dream which he thinks he has had, which he realizes cannot be explained in words, but makes plans to have Quince make a ballad out of it all the same.</scenedescription>

God&#8217;s my life, stol&#8217;n hence, and left me asleep! I have had a most rare vision. I have had a dream, past the wit of man to say what dream it was. Man is but an ass, if he go about t&#8217; expound this dream. Methought I was&#8212;there is no man can tell what. Methought I was, and methought I had&#8212;but man is but a patch&#8217;d fool, if he will offer to say what methought I had. The eye of man hath not heard, the ear of man hath not seen, man&#8217;s hand is not able to taste, his tongue to conceive, nor his heart to report, what my dream was. I will get Peter Quince to write a ballet of this dream. It shall be call&#8217;d &#8220;Bottom&#8217;s Dream,&#8221; because it hath no bottom; and I will sing it in the latter end of a play, before the Duke.

<scenedescription>Theseus and Hippolyta discuss the story they have heard from the lovers, though Theseus dismisses its truth. The lovers, like their rulers now married, come in, and Theseus asks to find out what entertainment they shall have before bedtime. He dismisses many of the options, finally choosing the artisans&#8217; play, despite Philostrate&#8217;s insistence that it is unworthy. Hippolyta wonders at Theseus&#8217;s choice, since Philostrate insists that the men can&#8217;t act, but the Duke argues that their humble willingness to try will outweigh their inadequacy. As the play begins, the audience begins to comment. Overwrought and overacted, and endlessly interrupted by the actors&#8217; apologies to the audience, the play is unintentionally hilarious, to the delight of Theseus&#8217;s court. The comments grow crueler and crueler, but the actors are undeterred. Once the actors finish the dance that ends the play, it is midnight, and Theseus orders all to go to bed. Once the humans have left, the fairies enter, blessing the house and promising a quiet night to all its occupants. Left alone, Puck begs the audience&#8217;s forgiveness for any offense.</scenedescription>

<line type="lyric">Now, until the break of day,</line>

<line type="lyric">Gentles, do not reprehend.</line>
<line type="lyric">If you pardon, we will mend.</line>
<line type="lyric">And, as I am an honest Puck,</line>

<line type="lyric">Now to scape the serpent&#8217;s tongue,</line>
<line type="lyric">We will make amends ere long;</line>
<line type="lyric">Else the Puck a liar call.</line>
<line type="lyric">So, good night unto you all.</line>
