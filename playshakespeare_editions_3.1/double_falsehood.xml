What horsemanship has Julio? I think, he can no more but gallop a hackney, unless he practiced riding in france. It may be, he did so; for he was there a good continuance. But I have not heard him speak much of his horsemanship. That&#8217;s no matter: if he be not a good horseman, all&#8217;s one in such a case, he must bear.

You may halt after her, whom you profess to pursue, and catch her too; marry, not unless your father let you slip.&#8212;Briefly, I desire you, (for she tells me, my instructions shall be both eyes and feet to her) no farther to insist in your requiring, &#8217;till, as I have formerly said, Camillo make known to me, that his good liking goes along with us; which but once breath&#8217;d, all is done; &#8217;till when, the business has no life, and cannot find a beginning.</line></speech><speech><speaker>JUL.</speaker><line>Sir, I will know his mind, e&#8217;er I taste sleep:</line><line>At morn, you shall be learn&#8217;d in his desire.</line><line>I take my leave.

BERN.</speaker><line>His father is as unsettled, as he is wayward, in his disposition. If I thought young Julio&#8217;s temper were not mended by the metal of his mother, I should be something crazy in giving my consent to this match: and, to tell you true, if my eyes might be the directors to your mind, I could in this town look upon twenty men of more delicate choice. I speak not this altogether to unbend your affections to him: but the meaning of what I say is, that you set such price upon yourself to him, as many, and much his betters, would buy you at; (and reckon those virtues in you at the rate of their scarcity) to which if he come not up, you remain for a better mart.</line></speech><speech><speaker>LEON.</speaker><line>My obedience, sir, is chain&#8217;d to your advice.</line></speech><speech><speaker>D. BERN.</speaker><line>&#8217;Tis well said, and wisely. I fear, your lover is a little folly-tainted; which, shortly after it proves so, you will repent.</line></speech><speech><speaker>LEON.</speaker><line>Sir, I confess, I approve him of all the men I know; but that approbation is nothing, &#8217;till season&#8217;d by your consent.</line></speech><speech><speaker>D. BERN.</speaker><line>We shall hear soon what his father will do, and so proceed accordingly. I have no great heart to the business, neither will I with any violence oppose it: but leave it to that power which rules in these conjunctions, and there&#8217;s an end.

BERN.</speaker><line>Look&#8217;e, Camillo; will you please to put your indignation in your pocket for half a moment, while I tell you the whole truth of the matter. My daughter, you must know, is such a tender soul, she cannot possibly see a Duke&#8217;s younger son without falling desperately in love with him. Now, you know, neighbor, when greatness rides post after a man of my years, &#8217;tis both prudence, and good breeding, to let one&#8217;s self be overtaken by it. And who can help all this? I profess, it was not my seeking, neighbor.</line></speech><speech><speaker>CAM.</speaker><line>I profess, a fox might earth in the hollowness of your heart, neighbor, and there&#8217;s an end.
