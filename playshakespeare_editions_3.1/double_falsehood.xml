BERN.">Don Bernard</persname><persdescription>Don Bernard is Leonora&#8217;s father, a crusty old man who claims to have sympathy for the young and for women&#8217;s right to choose their own husbands, but shows little signs of it. He wishes Leonora would find a richer young man than Julio, and has far more consideration for the business transaction aspect of marriage than for anything as silly as love. Not very self-aware, he does not realize that he could be talking about himself when he describes his father-in-law as a blockhead. His distemper at Leonora&#8217;s continued refusals to marry Henriquez grows to violence when she still refuses at the altar; the only explanation he can come up with is that she has gone mad. He only realizes how wrong he&#8217;s been when Leonora is abducted from the convent where she&#8217;d taken refuge, and the realization brings him to tears. He is rather an old fool, but not a malicious one.</persdescription></persona><persona gender="male"><persname short="RODER.">Roderick</persname><persdescription>Roderick is the Duke of Andalusia&#8217;s eldest son, and a decent, upright young man. He is concerned about his younger brother Henriquez&#8217;s actions, though he puts them down to youth rather than evil disposition. Their father sends him to keep an eye on the younger man. Though growing ever more suspicious of what Henriquez has been up to, he agrees to help his brother abduct Leonora from a convent. The evidence mounting against Henriquez convinces him, however, and he decides to force his brother to admit to his wrongs by publicly confronting him with the various witnesses. So long as honor is satisfied all around, he is not concerned with punishing.</persdescription></persona><persona gender="male"><persname short="MAST.">Master of the Flocks</persname><persdescription>The Master of the Flocks hires the disguised Violante as a shepherding apprentice. He soon realizes that &#8216;Florio&#8217; is in fact a woman, and as he is a man with very precise ideas about what to do when a woman unexpectedly falls into one&#8217;s hands, he quickly intends to take advantage of the situation. He is not the most sympathetic of men, particularly when he is interrupted before he can have his way with Violante. He is coarse and rather brutal, and enjoys drinking.</persdescription></persona><persona gender="male"><persname short="GER.">Gerald</persname><persdescription>Gerald is Henriquez&#8217;s servant. Able to arrange for a concert under a lady&#8217;s window, he is trusted to send messages, but not to know their content.</persdescription></persona><persona gender="male"><persname short="LOP.">Lopez</persname><persdescription>Lopez is a villager, Fabian&#8217;s neighbor. He overhears Henriquez&#8217;s ravings the night after his rape of Violante, and is concerned for the young man&#8217;s sanity.</persdescription></persona><persona gender="male"><persname short="HENR.">Henriquez</persname><persdescription>Henriquez is the Duke of Andalusia&#8217;s second son, and is in the process of sowing his wild oats, much to his father&#8217;s despair. Though wild and driven by his desires, he is not incapable of introspection. He is fully aware of the extent of his faults when he commits them, but this awareness does not alter his behavior; after raping Violante, he manages to rationalize that because she did not utter a sound, she was not truly resisting. Asked by his friend Julio to look after Leonora, he takes the opportunity to get Julio out of the way and woo the lady for himself, his passion for Violante being quite forgotten. Just as he blames Violante for not resisting vocally during her rape, he blames Leonora for causing him to fall in love with him. He obtains the consent of Don Bernard, Leonora&#8217;s father, to marry her thanks to his social rank, which he is not shy of pulling. He is a good liar when he needs to be, which is quite often. Faced with the evidence of his wrongdoing, he repents and chooses to act honorably, leaving everyone (presumably) happy.</persdescription></persona><persona gender="female"><persname short="VIOL.">Violante</persname><persaliases>	<persname short="FLO.">Florio</persname></persaliases><persdescription>Violante is a poor, young lady being wooed by Henriquez. Of humble birth, she has no desire to join the greats of this world, preferring her village. She therefore pays little attention to Henriquez&#8217;s blandishments. She is also worried that should he have his ways with her, he would then abandon her. Despite his promises to marry her, she still refuses him, and he rapes her. Though she resists him, she remains entirely silent during the act. Shamed and dishonored, she flees her father&#8217;s house, finally disguising herself as a shepherd boy named Florio, in the hopes of following Henriquez and shaming him. The disguise is not entirely successful: both the mad Julio and the Master of the Flocks realize that she is a woman, and the latter attempts to rape her, though Roderick&#8217;s arrival saves her in this instance. She enjoys singing to herself, and accompanies herself on the lute. There is no evidence of her ever being in love with Henriquez, rather wishing that he marry her to repair the crime he has committed against her and to restore her honor.</persdescription></persona><persona gender="male"><persname short="CAM.">Camillo</persname><persdescription>Camillo is Julio&#8217;s father. He sent his son to France to perfect his education, though he does not think overmuch of his abilities. He also finds Julio&#8217;s clothes extravagant. He is full of wise advice for his son, but with his neighbors he has the reputation of being a bit nutty. Quite well-off, he is a bluff fellow with little time for the fussiness of polite society, telling Don Bernard that he considers him a liar, not to mention accusing the Duke&#8217;s son Roderick of evil practices to his face. Hearing of his son&#8217;s madness, and then of his death, he becomes despondent and looks forward only to death. He is overjoyed when Julio turns out to be alive. He is 71 years old and suffers from gout.</persdescription></persona><persona gender="female"><persname short="LEON.">Leonora</persname><persdescription>Leonora is Don Bernard&#8217;s daughter and in love with Julio. She is a good, obedient child until her father interferes in her hopes to marry Julio, at which point she begins to defy him. She is aware of her place in society and that though well-off she is not from the highest ranks of society; she worries that when Julio is sent to court it will change him and make him forget her. She is aghast at Henriquez&#8217;s betrayal of his friend and refuses to marry him, being prepared to stab herself rather than go through with the wedding ceremony. Her attempts to escape by hiding in a nunnery are defeated when she is abducted from it by Henriquez and his brother Roderick. She is a determined young woman, and far from shy.</persdescription></persona><persona gender="male"><persname short="JUL.">Julio</persname><persdescription>Julio is Camillo&#8217;s son, who is deeply in love with Don Bernard&#8217;s daughter Leonora. An obedient son, he refuses to propose to her without his father&#8217;s approval, upon which Don Bernard&#8217;s consent depends. He is a friend of Henriquez&#8217;s &#8213; or at least believes himself to be one &#8213; and is an excellent, French-educated horseman who dresses rather too well for his station in life. Taking after his father, he is hot-blooded, emotional and passionate, and tends to overreact, never more perhaps than when he goes mad. He has little care for the court, especially when it takes him away from Leonora. Betrayed by Henriquez, he loses his wits, letting the gloomy side of his personality take over just as he loses control of his temper. He remains sensitive to music, though. He is quick to disguise himself to gain access to Leonora, and very physically affectionate when he finally gets her back. He is also generous enough to forgive Henriquez.</persdescription></persona><persona gender="male"><persname short="FAB.">Fabian</persname><persdescription>Fabian is a villager, Lopez&#8217;s neighbor. He overhears Henriquez&#8217;s ravings the night after his rape of Violante, and is concerned for the young man&#8217;s sanity.</persdescription></persona><persona gender="male"><persname short="CITIZ.">Citizen</persname><persdescription>A Citizen knows most of the main characters and likes them, and is quickly bribed to carry a letter from a clearly disobedient daughter. He is touched by Leonora&#8217;s plight and somewhat concerned by Julio&#8217;s fervor. This concern turns out to be justified when Julio goes mad, and the Citizen must report this to the young man&#8217;s father. He gets no thanks for delivering that particular piece of news.</persdescription></persona><persona gender="female"><persname short="MAID.">Maid</persname><persdescription>A Maid serves Violante, and lets her know that Gerald has brought her a letter.</persdescription></persona><persona gender="male"><persname short="DUKE.">Duke Angelo</persname><persdescription>Duke Angelo is the ruler of Andalusia, and Roderick and Henriquez&#8217;s father. An old man, he is making preparations for his death and his succession. Not a fool, he is as suspicious of Henriquez as he is fond of Roderick, but this does not imply that he does not love his younger son. He is a just and honorable man, if old-fashioned and having strong views about the rights of parents. His main concern is that there should be order in the world.</persdescription></persona><persona gender="male"><persname short="1. SHEP.">First Shepherd</persname><persdescription>The First Shepherd thinks that Julio would be a fine man were he not mad. He notes the madman&#8217;s attentiveness to music, and thinks that it may be worthwhile to pay attention to his ravings. He is not however so foolish as to not be afraid of Julio&#8217;s propensity to beating people up. He enjoys a good drink.</persdescription></persona><persona gender="male"><persname short="2. SHEP.">Second Shepherd</persname><persdescription>The Second Shepherd is convinced that there&#8217;s always a woman to blame if a man goes mad. Julio takes him for Henriquez and attempts to murder him, or at least to pull his nose off. He is less sympathetic to the mad young man than the First Shepherd is, though he too thinks that Julio looks like he&#8217;d be an excellent fellow when sane.</persdescription></persona><persona gender="male"><persname short="1. GENT.">First Gentleman</persname><persdescription>The First Gentleman accompanies Julio out of town when the latter goes mad, attempting to bring him to his right wits again. He is unimaginative and unromantic, and a bit of a snob about country folk&#8217;s musical abilities.</persdescription></persona> <persona gender="male"><persname short="2. GENT.">Second Gentleman</persname><persdescription>The Second Gentleman accompanies Julio out of town when the latter goes mad, attempting to bring him to his right wits again. He is very responsive to music and is far more sensitive to emotion than his friend the First Gentleman.</persdescription></persona><persona gender="male"><persname short="SERV.">Servant to Violante</persname><persdescription>The Servant to Violante is extremely faithful to her. He finds her the shepherd&#8217;s clothing she will use as a disguise.</persdescription></persona><persona gender="male"><persname short="ATT.">Attendant</persname><persdescription>An Attendant announces Roderick&#8217;s arrival to the Duke.</persdescription></persona> <persona gender="male"><persname short="CHURCH.">A Churchman</persname><persdescription>A Churchman [mute role] comes to Don Bernard&#8217;s house to marry Henriquez and Leonora.

Angelo&#8217;s only fear is that his younger son Henriquez&#8217;s behavior will tarnish the family name, but Roderick is certain that with age Henriquez will calm down. Angelo hopes that this is true, but is still bothered by the fact that Henriquez has removed himself from court. Roderick reports that Henriquez is sending his friend Julio to court to get some money for him to buy some horses. Angelo and Roderick decide to see whether they can get Julio to spy for them on his friend.</scenedescription><speech><speaker>RODER.</speaker><line form="verse">My gracious father, this unwonted strain</line><line form="verse">Visits my heart with sadness.</line></speech><speech><speaker>DUKE.</speaker><line form="verse" offset="6">Why, my son?</line><line form="verse">Making my death familiar to my tongue</line><line form="verse">Digs not my grave one jot before the date.</line><line form="verse">I&#8217;ve worn the garland of my honors long,</line><line form="verse">And would not leave it wither&#8217;d to thy brow,</line><line form="verse">But flourishing and green; worthy the man,</line><line form="verse">Who, with my Dukedoms, heirs my better glories.</line></speech><speech><speaker>RODER.</speaker><line form="verse">This praise, which is my pride, spreads me with blushes.</line></speech><speech><speaker>DUKE.</speaker><line form="verse">Think not, that I can flatter thee, my Roderick;</line><line form="verse">Or let the scale of love o&#8217;er-poise my judgment.</line><line form="verse">Like a fair glass of retrospection, thou</line><line form="verse">Reflect&#8217;st the virtues of my early youth;</line><line form="verse">Making my old blood mend its pace with transport:</line><line form="verse">While fond Henriquez, thy irregular brother,</line><line form="verse">Sets the large credit of his name at stake,</line><line form="verse">A truant to my wishes, and his birth.</line><line form="verse">His taints of wildness hurt our nicer honor,</line><line form="verse">And call for swift reclaim.</line></speech><speech><speaker>RODER.</speaker><line form="verse" offset="6">I trust, my brother</line><line form="verse">Will, by the vantage of his cooler wisdom,</line><line form="verse">E&#8217;er-while redeem the hot escapes of youth,</line><line form="verse">And court opinion with a golden conduct.</line></speech><speech><speaker>DUKE.</speaker><line form="verse">Be thou a prophet in that kind suggestion!</line><line form="verse">But I, by fears weighing his unweigh&#8217;d course,</line><line form="verse">Interpret for the future from the past.</line><line form="verse">And strange misgivings, why he hath of late</line><line form="verse">By importunity, and strain&#8217;d petition,</line><line form="verse">Wrested our leave of absence from the court,</line><line form="verse">Awake suspicion.

Julio himself is uncertain whether he wishes to go, as it involves leaving his beloved Leonora behind. He is particularly worried as her father is expecting him to propose to her that night, with Camillo&#8217;s consent. Leonora enters and is not impressed with Julio&#8217;s unwillingness to talk to his father on the matter, and suggests that they break up. When she finds out he has been summoned to court, however, she is upset, fearing he will find someone more beautiful there. He denies the possibility, and they vow their love to one another, both swearing to remain faithful. Her father Don Bernard enters, disapproving of their public display of affection and reminding Julio that things will move no further without Camillo&#8217;s approval. Julio leaves, promising to have Camillo&#8217;s consent by morning, and Don Bernard admits his reservations about the lad to his daughter, fearing that he may be a bit feather-brained. However, he is neither opposed nor in favor of the match, so is willing to let Leonora marry Julio so long as Camillo agrees.</scenedescription><stagedir type="enter">Enter Camillo with a letter.</stagedir><speech><speaker>CAM.</speaker><line form="prose">How comes the Duke to take such notice of my son, that he must needs have him in court, and I must send him upon the view of his letter?&#8212;Horsemanship! What horsemanship has Julio? I think, he can no more but gallop a hackney, unless he practiced riding in france. It may be, he did so; for he was there a good continuance. But I have not heard him speak much of his horsemanship. That&#8217;s no matter: if he be not a good horseman, all&#8217;s one in such a case, he must bear.

Julio enters in disguise, however, and they reassure each other of their love, though as they hear the musicians tuning for Leonora&#8217;s wedding ceremony they realize there is little time for them to decide what to do. Julio threatens to kill Henriquez, but Leonora points out that this would not improve matters. Julio has no better thoughts, but Leonora has considered matters, and hides him behind a tapestry, warning him not to emerge, no matter what. She threatens to kill herself if he disobeys. The doors open to show the large hall and chapel where the wedding is to take place. Henriquez tells Leonora to cheer up, but she launches into a diatribe against him and fidelity. Don Bernard accuses her of madness. Despite her speech, however, Don Bernard grabs her and forces her to take hands with Henriquez – but at that moment Julio steps out from behind the arras and makes his claim. Henriquez pulls rank, reminding Julio that he was sent to court at his command, and that it is treason for him to return without permission, but Julio replies that the injury Henriquez has done him is stronger than allegiance. Julio attempts to seize Julio, but Henriquez has him thrown out by the servants. Leonora faints, and as the men crowd around her to revive her they find a suicide note she had written in case she needed to kill herself to avoid marrying Henriquez, as well as the dagger with which she planned to do the deed.

Roderick insists he knew nothing of all this. Violante comes by and hides to listen to the conversation between the two men. She hears Camillo admit amazement that anyone related to Henriquez should be an honest man and Roderick disclaim his brotherhood. A Citizen arrives to inform them that Julio has left town, apparently insane. Don Bernard arrives as well, distraught over how things have turned out, and Camillo threatens him with his sword. Roderick steps between them, arguing that they have both lost children and therefore should be reconciled by their losses. They agree, and Roderick suggests that they spread out to find those who are missing. They do so. Violante comments on the difference between Roderick and his brother, but finds new hope in her despair: Henriquez is not yet married, and hence all is not yet lost for her. She resolves to follow Henriquez and shame him into marrying her, thus restoring her honor. A faithful servant comes to warn her that her father is having her searched for; she tests his honesty and trustworthiness, and asks him to procure her a shepherd&#8217;s clothes.</scenedescription><stagedir type="enter">Enter Roderick.</stagedir><speech><speaker>ROD.</speaker><line form="verse">Julio&#8217;s departure thus in secret from me,</line><line form="verse">With the long doubtful absence of my brother,</line><line form="verse">(Who cannot suffer, but my father feels it)</line><line form="verse">Have trusted me with strong suspicions,</line><line form="verse">And dreams, that will not let me sleep, nor eat,</line><line form="verse">Nor taste those recreations health demands:</line><line form="verse">But, like a whirlwind, hither have they snatch&#8217;d me,</line><line form="verse">Perforce, to be resolv&#8217;d.

The madman enters and turns out to be Julio, ranting about treachery. The shepherds send the Master&#8217;s boy, who is actually Violante in disguise, to talk to Julio in the hopes of finding out more about what brought him here. Julio almost notices that the shepherd boy is a woman, along with guessing that &#8220;he&#8221; has suffered in love, and counsels Violante to kill herself. The shepherds grab him to stop him harming anyone, but he fights them off, thinking one of them is Henriquez. Julio goes off, cursing Henriquez, and the injured shepherds go off to a tavern. The Master of the Flocks pans to meet them there, but first, having guessed that Violante is a woman, decides to have his way with her. She pleads with him, but he has no patience for that. Just as he is about to rape her, Roderick interrupts and she manages to escape. Roderick asks the Master some questions, but the curmudgeonly fellow refuses even to tell him the way. The nobleman is shocked at this lack of manners. It turns out that he is in the area looking for his brother, who is in the area because Leonora has cloistered herself in a nunnery nearby. Henriquez finds his brother, and insists that he must have the lady, and abduct her from the nunnery; Roderick agrees to help if only to try and make Henriquez behave honorably. He comes up with the plan of pretending to be carrying a body to burial and asking to spend the night at the nunnery, thus gaining access to Leonora. Roderick insists that she is to be treated honorably, and Henriquez agrees.</scenedescription><stagedir type="enter">Enter Master of the Flocks, three or four Shepherds, and Violante in boy&#8217;s clothes.</stagedir><speech><speaker>1.

Don Bernard is so weepy that he wishes he had Leonora back no matter the circumstances. News comes that Roderick is arriving, with a hearse in his train. He brings in Henriquez and Leonora. The Duke and Don Bernard are overjoyed, but Camillo reminds them of how he has been injured. The Duke lectures Leonora on how she ought to obey her father, and, believing Julio to be dead, she agrees to marry Henriquez so long as she is first allowed to mourn Julio properly. Violante nervously approaches, but keep hanging back until she is noticed. Roderick tells Henriquez it is his former, mistreated page, to Henriquez&#8217;s confusion, as he never had such a page. Violante approaches and, still pretending to be a boy, accuses Henriquez of promising to treat him well and advance him, only to cast &#8220;him&#8221; off for no good reason. The duke only asks for a witness to this to do &#8220;him&#8221; justice. Violante promises to produce one. In her absence Henriquez still insists this is a set-up, but Roderick produces a letter he argues proves that the pageboy was in his service; he begins reading it – it is the letter that Henriquez sent to Violante telling her he was forgetting her. Henriquez interrupts before his brother gets too far, and admits that he wrote the letter, but argues it must have been stolen from him and is now being used as blackmail against him. Accompanied by the disguised Julio, Violante comes back, now dressed as a woman, and Henriquez recognizes her. Though she gives up her claim on him since he no longer loves her, she still begs that he leave her a virtuous woman. He is so moved that he falls in love with her and proposes to marry her, begs Leonora&#8217;s forgiveness, and pledges not to marry until he has found Julio to apologize. Julio throws off his disguise and he and Leonora fall into each other&#8217;s arms – to the extent that Camillo cannot actually recognize his son. There is forgiveness all around and the whole company leaves for court, where the weddings will take place.</scenedescription><stagedir type="enter">Enter Duke, Don Bernard, and Camillo.</stagedir><speech><speaker>CAM.</speaker><line form="prose">Ay, then your grace had had a son more; he, a daughter; and I, an heir: but let it be as &#8217;tis, I cannot mend it; one way or other, I shall rub it over, with rubbing to my grave, and there&#8217;s an end on&#8217;t.</line></speech><speech><speaker>DUKE.</speaker><line form="verse">Our sorrows cannot help us, gentlemen.</line></speech><speech><speaker>CAM.</speaker><line form="prose">Hang me, sir, if I shed one tear more.
