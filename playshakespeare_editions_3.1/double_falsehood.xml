What horsemanship has Julio? I think, he can no more but gallop a hackney, unless he practiced riding in france. It may be, he did so; for he was there a good continuance. But I have not heard him speak much of his horsemanship. That&#8217;s no matter: if he be not a good horseman, all&#8217;s one in such a case, he must bear. Princes are absolute; they may do what they will in any thing, save what they cannot do.</LINE><STAGEDIR>Enter Julio.</STAGEDIR><LINE>O, come on, sir; read this paper: no more ado, but read it: it must not be answer&#8217;d by my hand, nor yours, but, in gross, by your person; your sole person.

BERN.</SPEAKER><LINE>What, Julio, in public? This wooing is too urgent.

BERN.</SPEAKER><LINE>Chase!&#8212;let chase alone; no matter for that. You may halt after her, whom you profess to pursue, and catch her too; marry, not unless your father let you slip.&#8212;Briefly, I desire you, (for she tells me, my instructions shall be both eyes and feet to her) no farther to insist in your requiring, &#8217;till, as I have formerly said, Camillo make known to me, that his good liking goes along with us; which but once breath&#8217;d, all is done; &#8217;till when, the business has no life, and cannot find a beginning.</LINE></SPEECH><SPEECH><SPEAKER>JUL.</SPEAKER><LINE>Sir, I will know his mind, e&#8217;er I taste sleep:</LINE><LINE>At morn, you shall be learn&#8217;d in his desire.</LINE><LINE>I take my leave.

I have thy promise, love;</LINE><LINE>Remember, and be faithful.</LINE></SPEECH><STAGEDIR>Exit Julio.</STAGEDIR><SPEECH><SPEAKER>D. BERN.</SPEAKER><LINE>His father is as unsettled, as he is wayward, in his disposition. If I thought young Julio&#8217;s temper were not mended by the metal of his mother, I should be something crazy in giving my consent to this match: and, to tell you true, if my eyes might be the directors to your mind, I could in this town look upon twenty men of more delicate choice. I speak not this altogether to unbend your affections to him: but the meaning of what I say is, that you set such price upon yourself to him, as many, and much his betters, would buy you at; (and reckon those virtues in you at the rate of their scarcity) to which if he come not up, you remain for a better mart.</LINE></SPEECH><SPEECH><SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER><LINE>My obedience, sir, is chain&#8217;d to your advice.</LINE></SPEECH><SPEECH><SPEAKER>D. BERN.</SPEAKER><LINE>&#8217;Tis well said, and wisely. I fear, your lover is a little folly-tainted; which, shortly after it proves so, you will repent.</LINE></SPEECH><SPEECH><SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER><LINE>Sir, I confess, I approve him of all the men I know; but that approbation is nothing, &#8217;till season&#8217;d by your consent.</LINE></SPEECH><SPEECH><SPEAKER>D. BERN.</SPEAKER><LINE>We shall hear soon what his father will do, and so proceed accordingly. I have no great heart to the business, neither will I with any violence oppose it: but leave it to that power which rules in these conjunctions, and there&#8217;s an end.

Was it a rape then? No. Her shrieks, her exclamations then had drove me from her.

The guilt! That&#8217;s true&#8212;</LINE><LINE>But then the danger; the tears, the clamours of the ruin&#8217;d maid, pursuing me to court. That, that, I fear will (as it already does my conscience) something shatter my honor. What&#8217;s to be done? But now I have no choice. Fair Leonora reigns confest the tyrant queen of my revolted heart, and Violante seems a short usurper there.

But, d&#8217;ye mark me, spare your tongue for the future; (and that&#8217;s using you hardly too, to bid you spare what you have a great deal too much of) go, go your ways, and d&#8217;ye hear, get ready within these two days to be married to a husband you don&#8217;t deserve.

BERN.</SPEAKER><LINE>Please to name it, sir.</LINE></SPEECH><SPEECH><SPEAKER>CAM.</SPEAKER><LINE>Sir, I have long held you in singular esteem: and what I shall now say, will be a proof of it. You know, sir, I have but one son.</LINE></SPEECH><SPEECH><SPEAKER>D. BERN.</SPEAKER><LINE>Ay, sir.</LINE></SPEECH><SPEECH><SPEAKER>CAM.</SPEAKER><LINE>And the fortune I am blest withal, you pretty well know what it is.</LINE></SPEECH><SPEECH><SPEAKER>D. BERN.</SPEAKER><LINE>&#8217;Tis a fair one, sir.</LINE></SPEECH><SPEECH><SPEAKER>CAM.</SPEAKER><LINE>Such as it is, the whole reversion is my son&#8217;s. He is now engaged in his attendance on our master, the Duke. But e&#8217;er he went, he left with me the secret of his heart, his love for your fair daughter. For your consent, he said, &#8217;twas ready. I took a night, indeed, to think upon it, and now have brought you mine; and am come to bind the contract with half my fortune in present, the whole some time hence, and, in the mean while, my hearty blessing. Ha? What say you to&#8217;t, Don Bernard?</LINE></SPEECH><SPEECH><SPEAKER>D. BERN.</SPEAKER><LINE>Why, really, neighbor,&#8212;I must own, I have heard something of this matter.</LINE></SPEECH><SPEECH><SPEAKER>CAM.</SPEAKER><LINE>Heard something of it? No doubt, you have.</LINE></SPEECH><SPEECH><SPEAKER>D. BERN.</SPEAKER><LINE>Yes, now I recollect it well.</LINE></SPEECH><SPEECH><SPEAKER>CAM.</SPEAKER><LINE>Was it so long ago then?</LINE></SPEECH><SPEECH><SPEAKER>D.

BERN.</SPEAKER><LINE>Not mock&#8217;d, good Camillo, not mock&#8217;d: but in love-matters, you know, there are abundance of changes in half an hour. Time, time, neighbor, plays tricks with all of us.</LINE></SPEECH><SPEECH><SPEAKER>CAM.</SPEAKER><LINE>Time, sir! What tell you me of time? Come, I see how this goes. Can a little time take a man by the shoulder, and shake off his honor? Let me tell you, neighbor, it must either be a strong wind, or a very mellow honesty that drops so easily. Time, quoth&#8217;a?</LINE></SPEECH><SPEECH><SPEAKER>D. BERN.</SPEAKER><LINE>Look&#8217;e, Camillo; will you please to put your indignation in your pocket for half a moment, while I tell you the whole truth of the matter. My daughter, you must know, is such a tender soul, she cannot possibly see a Duke&#8217;s younger son without falling desperately in love with him. Now, you know, neighbor, when greatness rides post after a man of my years, &#8217;tis both prudence, and good breeding, to let one&#8217;s self be overtaken by it. And who can help all this? I profess, it was not my seeking, neighbor.</LINE></SPEECH><SPEECH><SPEAKER>CAM.</SPEAKER><LINE>I profess, a fox might earth in the hollowness of your heart, neighbor, and there&#8217;s an end. If I were to give a bad conscience its true likeness, it should be drawn after a very near neighbor to a certain poor neighbor of yours.&#8212;Neighbor! With a pox!</LINE></SPEECH><SPEECH><SPEAKER>D. BERN.</SPEAKER><LINE>Nay, you are so nimble with me, you will hear nothing.</LINE></SPEECH><SPEECH><SPEAKER>CAM.</SPEAKER><LINE>Sir, if I must speak nothing, I will hear nothing. As for what you have to say, if it comes from your heart, &#8217;tis a lie before you speak it. I&#8217;ll to Leonora; and if I find her in the same story, why, I shall believe your wife was true to you, and your daughter is your own. Fare you well.</LINE></SPEECH><STAGEDIR>Exit, as into Don Bernard&#8217;s house.</STAGEDIR><SPEECH><SPEAKER>D. BERN.</SPEAKER><LINE>Ay, but two words must go to that bargain. It happens, that I am at present of opinion my daughter shall receive no more company to day; at least, no such visits as yours.</LINE></SPEECH><STAGEDIR>Exit Don Bernard, following him.</STAGEDIR></SCENE><SCENE><SCENETITLE>Scene 4</SCENETITLE><SCENELOCATION>Changes to another prospect of Don Bernard&#8217;s house.</SCENELOCATION><SCENEPERSONAE>(Leonora, Citizen, Don Bernard)</SCENEPERSONAE><STAGEDIR>Enter Leonora, above.</STAGEDIR><SPEECH><SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER><LINE>How tediously I&#8217;ve waited at the window,</LINE><LINE>Yet know not one that passes.
