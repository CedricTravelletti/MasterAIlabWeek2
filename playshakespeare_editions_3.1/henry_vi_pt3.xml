<personae playtitle="Henry VI, Part 3">

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="K. HEN.">King Henry the Sixth</persname>
<persdescription>King Henry VI, head of the Lancastrian party, is Margaret&#8217;s husband, Prince Edward&#8217;s father, and the desperately peace-loving monarch of a war-torn country. Desperate to keep his throne, he agrees to adopt the Duke of York as his heir instead of his own son, and from that point is no longer an active member of the fight, being pushed out of the role of leader by his wife and simply used as a pawn by all sides. Considered a weakling by the warlike members of his court, Henry is a pious and book-loving man completely out of his depth in a role that does not suit him, who feels the wounds that civil war causes his country deeply but can do nothing to cure them. He is aware of the weakness of his claim to the throne, but still feels that as an anointed monarch he cannot give up his claim. He dreams of the simple life of the shepherd but is not comfortable as a penniless refugee in Scotland. He is frightened of his wife, who bullies him. Not quite as dense as people believe him to be, he can see all too clearly how things will go as well as how things are, and this knowledge grows into prophecy as he looks at the young Earl of Richmond. He retreats more and more from worldly matters, to the extent that when he is freed from the Tower and restored to the throne his first act is to appoint Warwick and Clarence to run the kingdom for him while he retires to a life of meditation and praying &#8212; something not unlike what he led in prison all the same. He knows very well that Richard has come to kill him, and manages to discomfort him with his certainty and his fearless prophecies of disaster to be laid at Richard&#8217;s feet. A deeply kind man, Henry is, depending on one&#8217;s viewpoint, either a wimp or a visionary pacifist. His ghost returns in <persnameref>Richard III</persnameref>.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="PRINCE.">Edward, Prince of Wales</persname>
<persdescription>Prince Edward, of the Lancastrian party, is the son of Henry VI and his Queen, Margaret. He is very much his mother&#8217;s son, haughty, stubborn, and quick to insult. He pays little attention to his father, regarding him as a weakling, and rejecting his injunctions to restraint. Eager to fight for his rights, he is recklessly unwilling to bow to superior force, and even when captured by his enemies refuses to speak the slightest word that might imply a surrender, making his death at Yorkist hands even more certain than it ever was. He is slaughtered in front of his mother&#8217;s eyes. His ghost returns in <persnameref>Richard III</persnameref>.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="K. LEW.">Lewis the Eleventh, King of France</persname>
<persdescription>Lewis the Eleventh is the King of France, the son of the Dauphin of <persnameref>Henry VI, Part One</persnameref>. Not wishing for war to resume between England and France, he chooses to ally himself with Edward when assured by Warwick that the latter has the support of the people, though Lewis insists that he fully intends to be a friend to Margaret in her exile. He changes his mind on discovering that Edward has married, thereby dishonoring the Lady Bona whom he was meant to be wooing and Lewis himself. In his rage Lewis agrees to fund and arm Margaret and Prince Edward so that they can reclaim the throne for Henry. Though pragmatic and business-like, Lewis stands upon his honor and cannot stomach an insult.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="EXE.">Duke of Exeter</persname>
<persdescription>The Duke of Exeter, first of the Lancastrian and then of the Yorkist party, is at first a strong supporter of King Henry, but has to admit that the Duke of York&#8217;s claim to the throne is unanswerable. He remains one of Henry&#8217;s soldiers after York breaks his oath, and guards his King when Edward returns to take back the crown. He is more concerned by Edward&#8217;s persuasive powers than by his military worth. He is captured with King Henry and not heard of again. Exeter is intimidated by Queen Margaret.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="OXF.">Earl of Oxford</persname>
<persdescription>The Earl of Oxford, of the Lancastrian party, is a supporter of King Henry who follows Queen Margaret to France. Though at first he argues for Henry&#8217;s right to the throne, when challenged, it is soon revealed that the true reason for his allegiance has less to do with right and wrong than with desire for revenge on the Yorkists for the deaths of his father and brother. He follows Warwick when the latter rebels, and is one of the party that sneaks up and captures King Edward. He agrees with Somerset that Richmond should be safeguarded. Militarily-minded, he is always on the lookout for ways to increase the number of soldiers on his side, whether by raising new ones or joining with other armies. Captured by the Yorkists, he is sent away to prison. He returns in <persnameref>Richard III.</persnameref></persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="NORTH.">Earl of Northumberland</persname>
<persdescription>The Earl of Northumberland, of the Lancastrian party, is a powerful Northern supporter of King Henry. Though he despises the Duke of York, he ends up moved by his suffering.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="D. SOM.">Duke of Somerset</persname>
<persdescription>The Duke of Somerset, first of the Yorkist and then of the Lancastrian party, is the son of the Somerset of <persnameref>Henry VI, Part Two</persnameref>, whose head is carried in by Richard in the first scene. Though he appears won over to the Yorkist cause, he follows Clarence when the latter defects to Warwick. Guessing that there is more fighting to come, he convinces Oxford that they should send young Richmond abroad to keep him from harm&#8217;s way. Somewhat downcast by Warwick&#8217;s death and the Queen&#8217;s late arrival to battle, he is revived by Prince Edward&#8217;s valiant speech. Captured in battle, he has his head lopped off.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="WEST.">Earl of Westmorland</persname>
<persdescription>The Earl of Westmorland begins as a strong supporter of King Henry, but he is disgusted at what he sees as the latter&#8217;s defeatism and weakness and abandons him.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="YORK.">Richard Plantagenet, Duke of York</persname>
<persdescription>Richard Plantagenet, Duke of York, head of the Yorkist party, is the same character as in <persnameref>Henry VI, Part One</persnameref> and <persnameref>Part Two</persnameref>. Victorious in battle, he is able to impose his will on King Henry, though rather than simply take the crown he agrees to let Henry reign for the rest of his life, on the understanding that York&#8217;s family will succeed &#8212; and for that matter be the true rulers of England during the rest of Henry&#8217;s life. He is however easily convinced by his sons to break the oath he has sworn and attempt to dethrone Henry again. Over-confident in military victory, he is beaten and captured by Queen Margaret. He is at first silent under her torments, denying her the satisfaction of seeing him broken, but he cannot endure this forever, and in the ends spits out his rage, hatred and grief at Margaret and Clifford, bringing Northumberland to the verge of tears. Proud and deeply ambitious, he also loves his family deeply, particularly his youngest son Rutland, whose death breaks his spirit. He is particularly close to his son Richard.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="CLIF.">Lord Clifford</persname>
<persdescription>Lord Clifford, of the Lancastrian party, is the Young Clifford of <persnameref>Henry VI, Part Two</persnameref>. He is an angry and vindictive man, bent only on revenging his father&#8217;s death at Yorkist hands, and determined to slaughter the entire family of York. Brutal and unsentimental, he enjoys toying with his victims before killing them, and wholeheartedly joins in with Queen Margaret&#8217;s torment of York before finally stabbing him. He is disgusted at Henry&#8217;s weakness, but still attempts to shore him up and to convince him to act decisively and violently. His allegiance shifts more and more to Margaret and Prince Edward, who shows signs of being the sort of King Clifford wants. Shot through the neck with an arrow, he still manages to rant against the absent Henry before fainting. Found and tormented by the three York boys, it is uncertain at what point he actually dies.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="EDW.">Edward, Earl of March</persname>
<persaliases>
	<persname short="K. EDW.">King Edward</persname>
</persaliases>
<persdescription>Edward, Earl of March, of the Yorkist party, is later Duke of York and King Edward IV; he is the same as the Edward of <persnameref>Henry VI, Part Two</persnameref>. A loyal son, he has occasional attacks of conscience about the things he does, though these are mainly afterthoughts. He is not as intelligent as his brother Richard, nor quite as ambitious as either his brothers or his father, and is an unrepentant, uncontrolled womanizer, who would much rather go wenching than rule and does not necessarily accept the word &#8216;No.&#8217; Among his conquests is Warwick&#8217;s niece, something Warwick is willing to overlook at first. Edward does share his family&#8217;s morbid sense of humor, gleefully mocking Clifford (or his body). He is greatly dependent on Warwick for both advice and power, and is generally happy to let the older man lead. Rather feckless when he first becomes King, he never takes any of his brothers&#8217; complaints seriously; thinking George merely petulant, Edward does not realize that he is alienating him, nor that Richard is hoping to take the crown himself. He trades his help for sexual favors, and though he tries to be subtle about his meaning, he is rather crude in his advances to Lady Gray. His decision to marry her brings both his brother and Warwick to rebellion. He attempts to imitate Henry IV (see <persnameref>Richard II</persnameref>) when he returns to England claiming that he only wants his dukedom back, but is soon bullied into going after the crown again. He may feel guilt-stricken about this, refusing to let King Henry speak when they capture him. He is respected more as a persuasive speaker and well-loved man than as a fighter in his own right. Despite his somewhat repressed conscience, he stabs Prince Edward in front of his mother&#8217;s eyes. He does not, however, give orders for King Henry&#8217;s death. He is delighted when his wife gives him a son. How his reign turns out can be discovered in <persnameref>Richard III</persnameref>.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="RUT.">Edmund, Earl of Rutland</persname>
<persdescription>Edmund, Earl of Rutland, of the Yorkist party, is the Duke of York&#8217;s youngest son, a boy still being tutored and too young to fight. Captured by Clifford, he is slaughtered by the latter despite his pleading for his innocence. He is terrified of the man, and terrified of dying.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="WAR.">Earl of Warwick</persname>
<persdescription>The Earl of Warwick, first of the Yorkist and then of the Lancastrian party, is the Duke of York&#8217;s great supporter and friend, and later the chief power behind the throne to King Edward, then the instrument of his dethroning. He is somewhat full of himself and his ability to gift the crown to whomsoever he pleases, but this arrogance is based on the fact that this ability is genuine. He is a fighter and strongly believes that the might of arms is proof of justice. He is appointed guardian of King Henry after the Yorkists take power at the beginning of the play, but when Queen Margaret raises an army he is defeated by her in battle and can only rush to join the York sons and advise them. He becomes the mastermind behind Edward&#8217;s rise to the throne, both militarily and politically. He stands on his honor and is a fiery man who hates fleeing from battle and can be deeply vindictive towards those who have wronged him. He joins the York brothers in their mocking of the dying or dead Clifford, and renounces his allegiance to Edward when the latter makes a fool of him and humiliates him in front of the French King. Edward&#8217;s doing so, by marrying behind Warwick&#8217;s back, is the final straw, and Warwick remembers then that he has good cause to hate the Yorkists as well. His turn to the Lancastrian side comes out of personal hatred and desire for revenge rather than for any higher reason or conviction, though he claims that Edward is not worthy of the crown. He is deeply self-confident, at times over-confident, but this serves him well as it allows him to take great risks, such as capturing King Edward in his tent. Generally uncompromising and authoritarian, he is a much more decisive and dominant man than the Kings he serves. He is aware that he is the strongest prop to any cause he serves, and that his own death will lead to the fall of that cause. He has very black hair.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="GEO.">George</persname>
<persdescription>George (Duke of Clarence), first of the Yorkist party, then of the Lancastrian, then of the Yorkist again, is the Duke of York&#8217;s second son. The weakest of the three grown sons of York, he is not present at the battle until after his father&#8217;s death, though he joins his brothers in time to Towton and is with them to mock the dying Clifford. Edward&#8217;s career as a seducer amuses him, but he is outraged when his brother decides to marry the Lady Gray, and he is not shy about letting his opinion of Edward&#8217;s lack of political judgment known. Envious of his brother&#8217;s position and conscious of his own lack of means, he marries Warwick&#8217;s younger daughter and joins the Earl&#8217;s side when the latter rebels against Edward. He is among those who capture Edward by surprise, and witnesses his de-crowning by Warwick. He is made joint Protector of the realm with Warwick by King Henry when the latter is restored, but when called to actually fight against the returned Edward, he refuses and returns to his brother&#8217;s side. He does not like having his two-facedness pointed out to him, and uses it as his excuse when he stabs Prince Edward. He refuses to kill Queen Margaret, and guesses that his brother Richard has gone to kill King Henry. His further career can be found in <persnameref>Richard III</persnameref>.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="RICH.">Richard</persname>
<persdescription>Richard (Duke of Gloucester), of the Yorkist party, is the Duke of York&#8217;s third son. Particularly close to his father, he is the most intelligent and ruthless of the Duke&#8217;s sons. He is a limping hunchback with a withered left arm, though h is also an excellent and murderous fighter, and just how crippled he is physically and how much of it is in his mind is uncertain. His awareness of his own deformities verges on the pathological, and is not helped by the fact that they are the first thing his enemies use to insult him. He is a great mocker with a morbid sense of humor and little sense of morality &#8212; he convinces his father to break his oath on the basis of a ridiculous technicality. Tougher than his brothers, he insists on knowing how York died and refuses to weep, preferring to plot revenge. He is particularly enraged at Clifford for the latter&#8217;s murder of Richard&#8217;s younger brother Rutland, and is determined to kill him himself, though he is unsuccessful in this. He is amused at his brother Edward&#8217;s philandering, but becomes worried when the King decides to marry. The prospect of becoming yet further down in the line of succession crystallizes his realization that he wishes to be King himself, something of which there were only hints before. He remains loyal to Edward during Warwick&#8217;s rebellion because only with Edward safely on the throne can he himself hope to take it. He arranges for Edward&#8217;s escape from captivity and helps him beat the Lancastrian forces, later joining to kill Prince Edward. He also convinces Clarence to give up his allegiance to Warwick and return to his brothers&#8217; side. He then takes it upon himself to murder King Henry, with whom he has a disquieting conversation. Richard sets himself up as a unique sort of person and argues that it is the fault of the fate that left him deformed that bears the responsibility for his twisted mind. Just how far he is willing to go in his quest for the crown can be discovered in <persnameref>Richard III</persnameref>.</persdescription>

<persona gender="female">
<persname short="Q. MAR.">Queen Margaret</persname>
<persdescription>Queen Margaret, of the Lancastrian party, is King Henry&#8217;s wife, the mother of his son Prince Edward, and the strongest defender of his cause. She considers her husband a weakling and is horrified and appalled that he would give up their son&#8217;s rights in return for peace. Her love for her son is her strongest impetus after the humiliation the Yorkists have practiced on herself and Henry, and she is willing to risk everything to make sure that Prince Edward can inherit the throne. To her enemies&#8217; sexist dismay, she reveals herself to be a good general and leader of men, one capable of rousing speeches. She is acknowledged to be the true leader of the Lancastrian cause, as she can bully Henry into doing what she will. She does suffer from some insecurities, however, and when she captures the Duke of York her relief bursts forth in her hysterical, sadistic taunting of the man before killing him. Beaten, she seeks help from the King of France, her kinsman, but due to her weakness at this point it is only Warwick&#8217;s defection and the personal insult to himself that make Lewis agree to help. For the sake of regaining the crown for Henry and her son, she is willing even to make an alliance with the Warwick who has insulted and belittled her and was the main cause of her defeat. They are ultimately unsuccessful, however, and Margaret&#8217;s crowing over the death of York&#8217;s youngest son is paid back to her when she must watch her own son murdered before her eyes, and then is left to live herself. Though it is ordered that she be exiled to France at the end of the play, she returns in <persnameref>Richard III</persnameref>.</persdescription>

<persdescription>Lady Gray, of the Yorkist party, is a very attractive widow who has lost her lands when her husband was killed fighting on the Yorkist side. She petitions King Edward to get them back, not expecting that he will offer a trade instead: her body for her lands. She utterly refuses, being willing to lose her lands to avoid prostituting herself, but is shocked to hear him offer marriage instead. She is keenly aware that she is far too low-born to be Queen of England, but is in the end convinced. Her family immediately begins to gain wealth and power, to the disgust of the higher nobility. She attempts to build bridges to the royal brothers, but is not successful. Her marriage does not makes for a particularly happy life, as she is beset with the dislike of the nobility and the fears of civil war, which send her running to sanctuary when Warwick returns and captures Edward. She bears Edward a son by the play&#8217;s end. How this turns out can be discovered in <persnameref>Richard III</persnameref>.</persdescription>

<scenepersonae>(Richard Plantagenet, Duke of York, Edward, Richard, Norfolk, Montague, Warwick, Soldiers, King Henry, Clifford, Northumberland, Westmorland, Exeter, Queen Margaret, Prince Edward)</scenepersonae>
<scenedescription>York and his sons tally up the enemy dead, wondering how the King got away. York sits in the throne and King Henry and his supporters enter. Henry makes an attempt at seeming strong, but since even he realizes that his claim to the throne is weak, things soon begin to fall apart, with Exeter admitting that York&#8217;s claim is stronger. In the end Henry negotiates to keep the throne for the span of his lifetime, and for York to take it thereafter. Northumberland, Westmoreland and Clifford abandon the King in disgust at his cowardice and go to join the Queen. Henry regrets disinheriting his son, but sees this as the only solution. Queen Margaret comes to find him, though he attempts to escape her; she berates him for giving up her son&#8217;s inheritance and vows to fight to reclaim it, refusing to have anything more to do with Henry until the arrangement is abandoned. The young prince vows the same. Left alone, Henry plans to write to the three lords who left him in the hopes of reconciling with them.</scenedescription>

<scenedescription>York&#8217;s sons Richard and Edward, along with Warwick&#8217;s brother Montague, urge their father to break his oath to defend Henry while he lives. York at first refuses, but Richard presents a remarkable piece of sophistry, pointing out that the oath was invalid because not taken before a magistrate. Seizing on this loophole, York decides to go for it, and plans to send his sons to rouse his followers. At this point they learn that the Queen&#8217;s army is approaching, and though outnumbered four to one they decide to fight with the help of York&#8217;s uncles, the Mortimers.</scenedescription>

<line form="verse">What, was it you that would be England&#8217;s king?</line>
<line form="verse">Was&#8217;t you that revell&#8217;d in our parliament,</line>

<line form="verse">Where are your mess of sons to back you now,</line>
<line form="verse">The wanton Edward, and the lusty George?</line>
<line form="verse">And where&#8217;s that valiant crook-back prodigy,</line>
<line form="verse">Dicky, your boy, that with his grumbling voice</line>
<line form="verse">Was wont to cheer his dad in mutinies?</line>
<line form="verse">Or with the rest, where is your darling, Rutland?</line>
<line form="verse">Look, York, I stain&#8217;d this napkin with the blood</line>
<line form="verse">That valiant Clifford with his rapier&#8217;s point</line>
<line form="verse">Made issue from the bosom of the boy;</line>
<line form="verse">And if thine eyes can water for his death,</line>
<line form="verse">I give thee this to dry thy cheeks withal.</line>
<line form="verse">Alas, poor York, but that I hate thee deadly,</line>
<line form="verse">I should lament thy miserable state.</line>
<line form="verse">I prithee grieve, to make me merry, York.</line>
<line form="verse">What, hath thy fiery heart so parch&#8217;d thine entrils</line>
<line form="verse">That not a tear can fall for Rutland&#8217;s death?</line>
<line form="verse">Why art thou patient, man? Thou shouldst be mad;</line>
<line form="verse">And I, to make thee mad, do mock thee thus.</line>
<line form="verse">Stamp, rave, and fret, that I may sing and dance.</line>
<line form="verse">Thou wouldst be fee&#8217;d, I see, to make me sport:</line>

<line form="verse">Ay, marry, sir, now looks he like a king!</line>
<line form="verse">Ay, this is he that took King Henry&#8217;s chair,</line>
<line form="verse">And this is he was his adopted heir.</line>
<line form="verse">But how is it that great Plantagenet</line>
<line form="verse">Is crown&#8217;d so soon, and broke his solemn oath?</line>
<line form="verse">As I bethink me, you should not be king</line>
<line form="verse">Till our King Henry had shook hands with death.</line>

<line form="verse">And rob his temples of the diadem,</line>
<line form="verse">Now in his life, against your holy oath?</line>
<line form="verse">O, &#8217;tis a fault too too unpardonable!</line>

<line form="verse">&#8217;Tis beauty that doth oft make women proud,</line>

<line form="verse">O tiger&#8217;s heart wrapp&#8217;d in a woman&#8217;s hide!</line>

<line form="verse">Bid&#8217;st thou me rage? Why, now thou hast thy wish:</line>
<line form="verse">Wouldst have me weep? Why, now thou hast thy will:</line>
<line form="verse">For raging wind blows up incessant showers,</line>
<line form="verse">And when the rage allays, the rain begins.</line>
<line form="verse">These tears are my sweet Rutland&#8217;s obsequies,</line>

A messenger brings the news of York&#8217;s torment and death. Edward is brought almost to tears, Richard swears bloody revenge. Warwick arrives, having already heard of York&#8217;s death. He informs the brothers that the Queen is now in control of the royalist cause, and of what forces are available to fight her. Warwick names Edward Duke of York and swears to make him King.

<line form="verse">I, then in London, keeper of the King,</line>

<line form="verse">March&#8217;d toward Saint Albons to intercept the Queen,</line>

<line form="verse">Short tale to make, we at Saint Albons met,</line>
<line form="verse">Our battles join&#8217;d, and both sides fiercely fought;</line>
<line form="verse">But whether &#8217;twas the coldness of the King,</line>
<line form="verse">Who look&#8217;d full gently on his warlike queen,</line>
<line form="verse">That robb&#8217;d my soldiers of their heated spleen;</line>
<line form="verse">Or whether &#8217;twas report of her success,</line>
<line form="verse">Or more than common fear of Clifford&#8217;s rigor,</line>
<line form="verse">Who thunders to his captives blood and death,</line>
<line form="verse">I cannot judge: but, to conclude with truth,</line>
<line form="verse">Their weapons like to lightning came and went;</line>

<scenedescription>The Queen welcomes Henry to York; she and Clifford shame him when he pleads that he did not mean to break his oath. He is worried what inheritance this violence will be for his son. At Margaret&#8217;s request, he knights the boy. The Yorkist forces approach: Edward appears and demands that Henry kneel to him. Both sides exchange curses. Richard attacks Clifford for killing Rutland, and Edward puts the blame for all these broils on Margaret&#8217;s head. Henry tries vainly to be heard. Reconciliation is clearly hopeless, and both sides gird for battle.</scenedescription>

<scenedescription>King Henry, dismissed as useless by the Queen and Clifford, wanders about wishing he was not King, but merely a shepherd. A soldier comes in to despoil the corpse of an enemy he killed, who turns out to be his own father; and another, planning to do the same, discovers that he has killed his own son. The horrified King&#8217;s heart breaks as he considers how many more such cases there must be, wishing he could die and stop it all. Margaret rushes in to tell him to flee, as the royalist forces have lost the day; docilely, he lets himself be led.</scenedescription>

<scenepersonae>(First Gamekeeper, Second Gamekeeper, King Henry)</scenepersonae>
<scenedescription>Two gamekeepers lie in wait for deer, but find Henry instead; he discusses to himself how Margaret has gone to seek help in France, but how low the chances of success are. The two gamekeepers arrest him. He rebukes them mildly for breaking their oath to him, but they point how that they were only his subjects while he was king. He then goes with them, to be sent on to London.</scenedescription>

<line form="verse">My queen and son are gone to France for aid;</line>
<line form="verse">And, as I hear, the great commanding Warwick</line>
<line form="verse">Is thither gone to crave the French king&#8217;s sister</line>
<line form="verse">To wife for Edward. If this news be true,</line>
<line form="verse">Poor queen and son, your labor is but lost;</line>
<line form="verse">For Warwick is a subtle orator,</line>
<line form="verse">And Lewis a prince soon won with moving words.</line>
<line form="verse">By this account then, Margaret may win him,</line>
<line form="verse">For she&#8217;s a woman to be pitied much.</line>
<line form="verse">Her sighs will make a batt&#8217;ry in his breast,</line>
<line form="verse">Her tears will pierce into a marble heart;</line>
<line form="verse">The tiger will be mild whiles she doth mourn;</line>
<line form="verse">And Nero will be tainted with remorse</line>
<line form="verse">To hear and see her plaints, her brinish tears.</line>
<line form="verse">Ay, but she&#8217;s come to beg; Warwick, to give:</line>
<line form="verse">She, on his left side, craving aid for Henry;</line>
<line form="verse">He, on his right, asking a wife for Edward.</line>
<line form="verse">She weeps, and says her Henry is depos&#8217;d;</line>
<line form="verse">He smiles, and says his Edward is install&#8217;d;</line>
<line form="verse">That she, poor wretch, for grief can speak no more;</line>
<line form="verse">Whiles Warwick tells his title, smooths the wrong,</line>
<line form="verse">Inferreth arguments of mighty strength,</line>
<line form="verse">And in conclusion wins the King from her</line>

<line form="verse">O Margaret, thus &#8217;twill be, and thou, poor soul,</line>

<speaker>K. HEN.</speaker>
<line form="verse">More than I seem, and less than I was born to;</line>

<line form="verse">My crown is in my heart, not on my head;</line>
<line form="verse">Not deck&#8217;d with diamonds and Indian stones,</line>
<line form="verse">Nor to be seen. My crown is call&#8217;d content,</line>
<line form="verse">A crown it is that seldom kings enjoy.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. KEEP.</speaker>
<line form="verse">Well, if you be a king crown&#8217;d with content,</line>
<line form="verse">Your crown content and you must be contented</line>
<line form="verse">To go along with us; for, as we think,</line>
<line form="verse">You are the king King Edward hath depos&#8217;d;</line>
<line form="verse">And we his subjects, sworn in all allegiance,</line>
<line form="verse">Will apprehend you as his enemy.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>K. HEN.</speaker>
<line form="verse">But did you never swear and break an oath?</line>

<speech>
<speaker>2. KEEP.</speaker>
<line form="verse">No, never such an oath, nor will not now.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>K. HEN.</speaker>
<line form="verse">I was anointed king at nine months old,</line>
<line form="verse">My father and my grandfather were kings;</line>

<line form="verse">And tell me then, have you not broke your oaths?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. KEEP.</speaker>
<line form="verse">No,</line>
<line form="verse">For we were subjects but while you were king.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. HEN.</speaker>
<line form="verse">Why? Am I dead? Do I not breathe a man?</line>
<line form="verse">Ah, simple men, you know not what you swear!</line>
<line form="verse">Look, as I blow this feather from my face,</line>
<line form="verse">And as the air blows it to me again,</line>
<line form="verse">Obeying with my wind when I do blow,</line>
<line form="verse">And yielding to another when it blows,</line>
<line form="verse">Commanded always by the greater gust,</line>
<line form="verse">Such is the lightness of you common men.</line>
<line form="verse">But do not break your oaths, for of that sin</line>
<line form="verse">My mild entreaty shall not make you guilty.</line>
<line form="verse">Go where you will, the King shall be commanded;</line>
<line form="verse">And be you kings: command, and I&#8217;ll obey.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. KEEP.</speaker>
<line form="verse">We are true subjects to the King, King Edward.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. HEN.</speaker>
<line form="verse">So would you be again to Henry,</line>
<line form="verse">If he were seated as King Edward is.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>1. KEEP.</speaker>
<line form="verse">We charge you, in God&#8217;s name and the King&#8217;s,</line>

<scenepersonae>(King Edward, Gloucester, Clarence, Lady Grey, Nobleman)</scenepersonae>
<scenedescription>Lady Grey asks Edward to return her husband&#8217;s lands to her, since he died fighting in the Yorkist cause. Edward is taken with the lady, and quite crudely solicits her, agreeing to hand the lands back if she&#8217;ll sleep with him. Gloucester and Clarence observe amusedly until she indignantly refuses and Edward offers to marry her instead. Left alone, the deformed Richard considers how his shape leaves him no joy in life, and decides to seek the crown, though he is as yet uncertain how to go about it.</scenedescription>

<line form="verse">And all the unlook&#8217;d-for issue of their bodies</line>
<line form="verse">To take their rooms, ere I can place myself:</line>
<line form="verse">A cold premeditation for my purpose!</line>
<line form="verse">Why then I do but dream on sovereignty,</line>
<line form="verse">Like one that stands upon a promontory</line>
<line form="verse">And spies a far-off shore where he would tread,</line>
<line form="verse">Wishing his foot were equal with his eye,</line>
<line form="verse">And chides the sea that sunders him from thence,</line>
<line form="verse">Saying, he&#8217;ll lade it dry to have his way:</line>
<line form="verse">So do I wish the crown, being so far off,</line>

<line form="verse">My eye&#8217;s too quick, my heart o&#8217;erweens too much,</line>

<line form="verse">Well, say there is no kingdom then for Richard;</line>
<line form="verse">What other pleasure can the world afford?</line>
<line form="verse">I&#8217;ll make my heaven in a lady&#8217;s lap,</line>
<line form="verse">And deck my body in gay ornaments,</line>
<line form="verse">And witch sweet ladies with my words and looks.</line>
<line form="verse">O miserable thought! And more unlikely</line>
<line form="verse">Than to accomplish twenty golden crowns!</line>
<line form="verse">Why, love forswore me in my mother&#8217;s womb;</line>
<line form="verse">And for I should not deal in her soft laws,</line>
<line form="verse">She did corrupt frail nature with some bribe,</line>
<line form="verse">To shrink mine arm up like a wither&#8217;d shrub,</line>
<line form="verse">To make an envious mountain on my back,</line>
<line form="verse">Where sits deformity to mock my body;</line>
<line form="verse">To shape my legs of an unequal size,</line>
<line form="verse">To disproportion me in every part,</line>
<line form="verse">Like to a chaos, or an unlick&#8217;d bear-whelp</line>
<line form="verse">That carries no impression like the dam.</line>
<line form="verse">And am I then a man to be belov&#8217;d?</line>
<line form="verse">O monstrous fault, to harbor such a thought!</line>
<line form="verse">Then since this earth affords no joy to me</line>
<line form="verse">But to command, to check, to o&#8217;erbear such</line>
<line form="verse">As are of better person than myself,</line>
<line form="verse">I&#8217;ll make my heaven to dream upon the crown,</line>

<line form="verse">Until my misshap&#8217;d trunk that bears this head</line>
<line form="verse">Be round impaled with a glorious crown.</line>
<line form="verse">And yet I know not how to get the crown,</line>
<line form="verse">For many lives stand between me and home;</line>
<line form="verse">And I&#8212;like one lost in a thorny wood,</line>
<line form="verse">That rents the thorns, and is rent with the thorns,</line>
<line form="verse">Seeking a way, and straying from the way,</line>
<line form="verse">Not knowing how to find the open air,</line>

<line form="verse">Torment myself to catch the English crown;</line>
<line form="verse">And from that torment I will free myself,</line>
<line form="verse">Or hew my way out with a bloody axe.</line>
<line form="verse">Why, I can smile, and murder whiles I smile,</line>
<line form="verse">And cry &#8220;Content&#8221; to that which grieves my heart,</line>
<line form="verse">And wet my cheeks with artificial tears,</line>
<line form="verse">And frame my face to all occasions.</line>
<line form="verse">I&#8217;ll drown more sailors than the mermaid shall,</line>

<scenedescription>Margaret begs for help from King Lewis of France, who seems well-disposed towards her until Warwick arrives with the offer that Edward should marry Lewis&#8217;s sister Bona. Margaret tries to wreck the diplomacy, but when Lewis questions Warwick further and decides that Edward is well-settled as King, her efforts come to naught. All is arranged between Warwick and Lewis, until a messenger arrives with letters informing Warwick that Edward has married Lady Grey. Infuriated at being publically made a fool like this, Warwick immediately abandons Edward&#8217;s cause and rallies to Margaret. With the French, they plan an invasion to overthrow the Yorkist regime. Warwick and Margaret agree to marry their children to each other.</scenedescription>

<line form="verse">Look therefore, Lewis, that by this league and marriage</line>

<scenepersonae>(Henry the Sixth, Richard of Gloucester, Lieutenant)</scenepersonae>
<scenedescription>Richard and Henry meet at the Tower. Henry has no doubt that Richard is there to kill him. When Richard tells him he killed Henry&#8217;s son, the deposed King prophecies that Richard will bring great darkness to England. Refusing to hear him out, Richard stabs him. Standing over the corpse, and stabbing it again, he considers that he does not know what love is. He ruminates on his plan to kill off all who stand in his way to the throne, including his brothers.</scenedescription>
