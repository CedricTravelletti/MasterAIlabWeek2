<speaker>WAR.</speaker>
<line>I wonder how the King escap&#8217;d our hands.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>YORK.</speaker>
<line>While we pursu&#8217;d the horsemen of the north,</line>
<line>He slily stole away and left his men;</line>
<line>Whereat the great Lord of Northumberland,</line>
<line>Whose warlike ears could never brook retreat,</line>
<line>Cheer&#8217;d up the drooping army, and himself,</line>
<line>Lord Clifford, and Lord Stafford, all abreast,</line>
<line>Charg&#8217;d our main battle&#8217;s front; and breaking in,</line>
<line>Were by the swords of common soldiers slain.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>EDW.</speaker>
<line>Lord Stafford&#8217;s father, Duke of Buckingham,</line>
<line>Is either slain or wounded dangerous;</line>
<line>I cleft his beaver with a downright blow.</line>
<line>That this is true, father, behold his blood.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MONT.</speaker>
<line>And, brother, here&#8217;s the Earl of Wiltshire&#8217;s blood,</line>
<line>Whom I encount&#8217;red as the battles join&#8217;d.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>RICH.</speaker>
<line>Speak thou for me and tell them what I did.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Showing the Duke of Somerset&#8217;s head.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>YORK.</speaker>
<line>Richard hath best deserv&#8217;d of all my sons.</line>
<line>But is your Grace dead, my Lord of Somerset?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NORF.</speaker>
<line>Such hope have all the line of John of Gaunt!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>RICH.</speaker>
<line>Thus do I hope to shake King Henry&#8217;s head.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WAR.</speaker>
<line>And so do I, victorious prince of York.</line>
<line>Before I see thee seated in that throne</line>
<line>Which now the house of Lancaster usurps,</line>
<line>I vow by heaven these eyes shall never close.</line>
<line>This is the palace of the fearful king,</line>
<line>And this the regal seat. Possess it, York,</line>
<line>For this is thine and not King Henry&#8217;s heirs&#8217;.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>YORK.</speaker>
<line>Assist me then, sweet Warwick, and I will,</line>
<line>For hither we have broken in by force.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NORF.</speaker>
<line>We&#8217;ll all assist you; he that flies shall die.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>YORK.</speaker>
<line>Thanks, gentle Norfolk. Stay by me, my lords,</line>
<line>And, soldiers, stay and lodge by me this night.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>They go up.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>WAR.</speaker>
<line>And when the King comes, offer him no violence,</line>
<line>Unless he seek to thrust you out perforce.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>YORK.</speaker>
<line>The Queen this day here holds her parliament,</line>
<line>But little thinks we shall be of her council.</line>
<line>By words or blows here let us win our right.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>RICH.</speaker>
<line>Arm&#8217;d as we are, let&#8217;s stay within this house.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WAR.</speaker>
<line>The bloody parliament shall this be call&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Unless Plantagenet, Duke of York, be king,</line>
<line>And bashful Henry depos&#8217;d, whose cowardice</line>
<line>Hath made us by-words to our enemies.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>YORK.</speaker>
<line>Then leave me not, my lords, be resolute,</line>
<line>I mean to take possession of my right.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WAR.</speaker>
<line>Neither the King, nor he that loves him best,</line>
<line>The proudest he that holds up Lancaster,</line>
<line>Dares stir a wing if Warwick shake his bells.</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll plant Plantagenet, root him up who dares.</line>
<line>Resolve thee, Richard, claim the English crown.</line>

<stagedir>Flourish. Enter King Henry, Clifford, Northumberland, Westmorland, Exeter, and the rest, with red roses in their hats.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>K. HEN.</speaker>
<line>My lords, look where the sturdy rebel sits,</line>
<line>Even in the chair of state. Belike he means,</line>
<line>Back&#8217;d by the power of Warwick, that false peer,</line>
<line>To aspire unto the crown and reign as king.</line>
<line>Earl of Northumberland, he slew thy father,</line>
<line>And thine, Lord Clifford, and you both have vow&#8217;d revenge</line>
<line>On him, his sons, his favorites, and his friends.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NORTH.</speaker>
<line>If I be not, heavens be reveng&#8217;d on me!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CLIF.</speaker>
<line>The hope thereof makes Clifford mourn in steel.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WEST.</speaker>
<line>What, shall we suffer this? Let&#8217;s pluck him down.</line>
<line>My heart for anger burns, I cannot brook it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. HEN.</speaker>
<line>Be patient, gentle Earl of Westmorland.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CLIF.</speaker>
<line>Patience is for poltroons, such as he.</line>
<line>He durst not sit there, had your father liv&#8217;d.</line>
<line>My gracious lord, here in the parliament</line>
<line>Let us assail the family of York.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NORTH.</speaker>
<line>Well hast thou spoken, cousin, be it so.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. HEN.</speaker>
<line>Ah, know you not the city favors them,</line>
<line>And they have troops of soldiers at their beck?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>EXE.</speaker>
<line>But when the Duke is slain, they&#8217;ll quickly fly.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. HEN.</speaker>
<line>Far be the thought of this from Henry&#8217;s heart,</line>
<line>To make a shambles of the parliament house!</line>
<line>Cousin of Exeter, frowns, words, and threats</line>
<line>Shall be the war that Henry means to use.</line>
<line>Thou factious Duke of York, descend my throne,</line>
<line>And kneel for grace and mercy at my feet:</line>
<line>I am thy sovereign.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>YORK.</speaker>
<line offset="4">I am thine.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>EXE.</speaker>
<line>For shame, come down. He made thee Duke of York.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>YORK.</speaker>
<line>It was my inheritance, as the earldom was.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>EXE.</speaker>
<line>Thy father was a traitor to the crown.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WAR.</speaker>
<line>Exeter, thou art a traitor to the crown,</line>
<line>In following this usurping Henry.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CLIF.</speaker>
<line>Whom should he follow but his natural king?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WAR.</speaker>
<line>True, Clifford, that&#8217;s Richard Duke of York.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. HEN.</speaker>
<line>And shall I stand, and thou sit in my throne?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>YORK.</speaker>
<line>It must and shall be so. Content thyself.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WAR.</speaker>
<line>Be Duke of Lancaster, let him be King.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WEST.</speaker>
<line>He is both King and Duke of Lancaster,</line>
<line>And that the Lord of Westmorland shall maintain.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WAR.</speaker>
<line>And Warwick shall disprove it. You forget</line>
<line>That we are those which chas&#8217;d you from the field,</line>
<line>And slew your fathers, and with colors spread</line>
<line>March&#8217;d through the city to the palace gates.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NORTH.</speaker>
<line>Yes, Warwick, I remember it to my grief,</line>
<line>And by his soul, thou and thy house shall rue it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WEST.</speaker>
<line>Plantagenet, of thee and these thy sons,</line>
<line>Thy kinsmen and thy friends, I&#8217;ll have more lives</line>
<line>Than drops of blood were in my father&#8217;s veins.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CLIF.</speaker>
<line>Urge it no more, lest that, in stead of words,</line>
<line>I send thee, Warwick, such a messenger</line>
<line>As shall revenge his death before I stir.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WAR.</speaker>
<line>Poor Clifford, how I scorn his worthless threats!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>YORK.</speaker>
<line>Will you we show our title to the crown?</line>
<line>If not, our swords shall plead it in the field.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. HEN.</speaker>
<line>What title hast thou, traitor, to the crown?</line>
<line>Thy father was, as thou art, Duke of York,</line>
<line>Thy grandfather, Roger Mortimer, Earl of March:</line>
<line>I am the son of Henry the Fifth,</line>
<line>Who made the Dauphin and the French to stoop,</line>
<line>And seiz&#8217;d upon their towns and provinces.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WAR.</speaker>
<line>Talk not of France, sith thou hast lost it all.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. HEN.</speaker>
<line>The Lord Protector lost it, and not I;</line>
<line>When I was crown&#8217;d I was but nine months old.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>RICH.</speaker>
<line>You are old enough now, and yet methinks you lose.</line>
<line>Father, tear the crown from the usurper&#8217;s head.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>EDW.</speaker>
<line>Sweet father, do so, set it on your head.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MONT.</speaker>
<line>Good brother, as thou lov&#8217;st and honorest arms,</line>
<line>Let&#8217;s fight it out, and not stand cavilling thus.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>RICH.</speaker>
<line>Sound drums and trumpets, and the King will fly.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>YORK.</speaker>
<line>Sons, peace!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. HEN.</speaker>
<line>Peace thou! And give King Henry leave to speak.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WAR.</speaker>
<line>Plantagenet shall speak first. Hear him, lords,</line>
<line>And be you silent and attentive too,</line>
<line>For he that interrupts him shall not live.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. HEN.</speaker>
<line>Think&#8217;st thou that I will leave my kingly throne,</line>
<line>Wherein my grandsire and my father sat?</line>
<line>No; first shall war unpeople this my realm;</line>
<line>Ay, and their colors, often borne in France,</line>
<line>And now in England to our heart&#8217;s great sorrow,</line>
<line>Shall be my winding-sheet. Why faint you, lords?</line>
<line>My title&#8217;s good, and better far than his.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WAR.</speaker>
<line>Prove it, Henry, and thou shalt be King.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. HEN.</speaker>
<line>Henry the Fourth by conquest got the crown.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>YORK.</speaker>
<line>&#8217;Twas by rebellion against his king.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. HEN.</speaker>
<stagedir>Aside.</stagedir>
<line>I know not what to say, my title&#8217;s weak.&#8212;</line>
<line>Tell me, may not a king adopt an heir?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>YORK.</speaker>
<line>What then?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. HEN.</speaker>
<line>And if he may, then am I lawful king;</line>
<line>For Richard, in the view of many lords,</line>
<line>Resign&#8217;d the crown to Henry the Fourth,</line>
<line>Whose heir my father was, and I am his.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>YORK.</speaker>
<line>He rose against him, being his sovereign,</line>
<line>And made him to resign his crown perforce.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WAR.</speaker>
<line>Suppose, my lords, he did it unconstrain&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Think you &#8217;twere prejudicial to his crown?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>EXE.</speaker>
<line>No; for he could not so resign his crown</line>
<line>But that the next heir should succeed and reign.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. HEN.</speaker>
<line>Art thou against us, Duke of Exeter?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>EXE.</speaker>
<line>His is the right, and therefore pardon me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>YORK.</speaker>
<line>Why whisper you, my lords, and answer not?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>EXE.</speaker>
<line>My conscience tells me he is lawful king.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. HEN.</speaker>
<stagedir>Aside.</stagedir>
<line>All will revolt from me and turn to him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NORTH.</speaker>
<line>Plantagenet, for all the claim thou lay&#8217;st,</line>
<line>Think not that Henry shall be so depos&#8217;d.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WAR.</speaker>
<line>Depos&#8217;d he shall be, in despite of all.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NORTH.</speaker>
<line>Thou art deceiv&#8217;d. &#8217;Tis not thy southern power</line>
<line>Of Essex, Norfolk, Suffolk, nor of Kent,</line>
<line>Which makes thee thus presumptuous and proud,</line>
<line>Can set the Duke up in despite of me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CLIF.</speaker>
<line>King Henry, be thy title right or wrong,</line>
<line>Lord Clifford vows to fight in thy defense.</line>
<line>May that ground gape, and swallow me alive,</line>
<line>Where I shall kneel to him that slew my father!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. HEN.</speaker>
<line>O Clifford, how thy words revive my heart!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>YORK.</speaker>
<line>Henry of Lancaster, resign thy crown.</line>
<line>What mutter you, or what conspire you, lords?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WAR.</speaker>
<line>Do right unto this princely Duke of York,</line>
<line>Or I will fill the house with armed men,</line>
<line>And over the chair of state, where now he sits,</line>
<line>Write up his title with usurping blood.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>He stamps with his foot, and the Soldiers show themselves.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>K. HEN.</speaker>
<line>My Lord of Warwick, hear but one word:</line>
<line>Let me for this my lifetime reign as king.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>YORK.</speaker>
<line>Confirm the crown to me and to mine heirs,</line>

<line>Who can be patient in such extremes?</line>
<line>Ah, wretched man, would I had died a maid</line>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. MAR.</speaker>
<line>Enforc&#8217;d thee? Art thou king, and wilt be forc&#8217;d?</line>
<line>I shame to hear thee speak. Ah, timorous wretch,</line>
<line>Thou hast undone thyself, thy son, and me,</line>
<line>And giv&#8217;n unto the house of York such head</line>
<line>As thou shalt reign but by their sufferance.</line>
<line>To entail him and his heirs unto the crown,</line>
<line>What is it, but to make thy sepulchre,</line>
<line>And creep into it far before thy time?</line>
<line>Warwick is chancellor and the lord of Callice,</line>
<line>Stern Falconbridge commands the Narrow Seas,</line>
<line>The Duke is made Protector of the realm,</line>
<line>And yet shalt thou be safe? Such safety finds</line>
<line>The trembling lamb environed with wolves.</line>
<line>Had I been there, which am a silly woman,</line>
<line>The soldiers should have toss&#8217;d me on their pikes,</line>
<line>Before I would have granted to that act.</line>

<line>And seeing thou dost, I here divorce myself</line>
<line>Both from thy table, Henry, and thy bed,</line>
<line>Until that act of parliament be repeal&#8217;d</line>
<line>Whereby my son is disinherited.</line>
<line>The northern lords that have forsworn thy colors</line>
<line>Will follow mine, if once they see them spread;</line>
<line>And spread they shall be, to thy foul disgrace,</line>
<line>And utter ruin of the house of York.</line>
<line>Thus do I leave thee. Come, son, let&#8217;s away.</line>

<line>No, I can better play the orator.</line>

</speech>

<stagedir>Enter the Duke of York.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>YORK.</speaker>
<line>Why, how now, sons and brother, at a strife?</line>
<line>What is your quarrel? How began it first?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>EDW.</speaker>
<line>No quarrel, but a slight contention.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>YORK.</speaker>
<line>About what?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>RICH.</speaker>
<line>About that which concerns your Grace and us:</line>
<line>The crown of England, father, which is yours.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>YORK.</speaker>
<line>Mine, boys? Not till King Henry be dead.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>RICH.</speaker>
<line>Your right depends not on his life or death.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>EDW.</speaker>
<line>Now you are heir, therefore enjoy it now.</line>
<line>By giving the house of Lancaster leave to breathe,</line>
<line>It will outrun you, father, in the end.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>YORK.</speaker>
<line>I took an oath that he should quietly reign.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>EDW.</speaker>
<line>But for a kingdom any oath may be broken:</line>
<line>I would break a thousand oaths to reign one year.</line>

<line>No; God forbid your Grace should be forsworn.</line>

<line>Thou canst not, son; it is impossible.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>RICH.</speaker>
<line>An oath is of no moment, being not took</line>
<line>Before a true and lawful magistrate</line>
<line>That hath authority over him that swears.</line>
<line>Henry had none, but did usurp the place.</line>
<line>Then seeing &#8217;twas he that made you to depose,</line>
<line>Your oath, my lord, is vain and frivolous.</line>
<line>Therefore to arms! And, father, do but think</line>
<line>How sweet a thing it is to wear a crown,</line>
<line>Within whose circuit is Elysium</line>
<line>And all that poets feign of bliss and joy.</line>
<line>Why do we linger thus? I cannot rest</line>

<speaker>YORK.</speaker>
<line>The army of the Queen hath got the field:</line>
<line>My uncles both are slain in rescuing me;</line>
<line>And all my followers to the eager foe</line>
<line>Turn back and fly, like ships before the wind,</line>
<line>Or lambs pursu&#8217;d by hunger-starved wolves.</line>
<line>My sons, God knows what hath bechanced them;</line>
<line>But this I know, they have demean&#8217;d themselves</line>
<line>Like men born to renown by life or death.</line>
<line>Three times did Richard make a lane to me,</line>
<line>And thrice cried, &#8220;Courage, father! Fight it out!&#8221;</line>
<line>And full as oft came Edward to my side</line>

<line>And cried, &#8220;A crown, or else a glorious tomb!</line>
<line>A sceptre, or an earthly sepulchre!&#8221;</line>

<stagedir>A short alarum within.</stagedir>
<line>Ah, hark, the fatal followers do pursue,</line>

<line>Yet parted but the shadow with his hand.</line>
<line>What, was it you that would be England&#8217;s king?</line>
<line>Was&#8217;t you that revell&#8217;d in our parliament,</line>
<line>And made a preachment of your high descent?</line>
<line>Where are your mess of sons to back you now,</line>
<line>The wanton Edward, and the lusty George?</line>
<line>And where&#8217;s that valiant crook-back prodigy,</line>
<line>Dicky, your boy, that with his grumbling voice</line>
<line>Was wont to cheer his dad in mutinies?</line>
<line>Or with the rest, where is your darling, Rutland?</line>
<line>Look, York, I stain&#8217;d this napkin with the blood</line>
<line>That valiant Clifford with his rapier&#8217;s point</line>
<line>Made issue from the bosom of the boy;</line>
<line>And if thine eyes can water for his death,</line>
<line>I give thee this to dry thy cheeks withal.</line>
<line>Alas, poor York, but that I hate thee deadly,</line>
<line>I should lament thy miserable state.</line>
<line>I prithee grieve, to make me merry, York.</line>
<line>What, hath thy fiery heart so parch&#8217;d thine entrils</line>
<line>That not a tear can fall for Rutland&#8217;s death?</line>
<line>Why art thou patient, man? Thou shouldst be mad;</line>
<line>And I, to make thee mad, do mock thee thus.</line>
<line>Stamp, rave, and fret, that I may sing and dance.</line>
<line>Thou wouldst be fee&#8217;d, I see, to make me sport:</line>
<line>York cannot speak unless he wear a crown.</line>
<line>A crown for York! And, lords, bow low to him;</line>
<line>Hold you his hands whilest I do set it on.</line>

<stagedir>Putting a paper crown on his head.</stagedir>
<line>Ay, marry, sir, now looks he like a king!</line>
<line>Ay, this is he that took King Henry&#8217;s chair,</line>
<line>And this is he was his adopted heir.</line>
<line>But how is it that great Plantagenet</line>
<line>Is crown&#8217;d so soon, and broke his solemn oath?</line>
<line>As I bethink me, you should not be king</line>
<line>Till our King Henry had shook hands with death.</line>
<line>And will you pale your head in Henry&#8217;s glory,</line>
<line>And rob his temples of the diadem,</line>
<line>Now in his life, against your holy oath?</line>
<line>O, &#8217;tis a fault too too unpardonable!</line>
<line>Off with the crown; and, with the crown, his head,</line>

<line>Upon their woes whom fortune captivates!</line>
<line>But that thy face is vizard-like, unchanging,</line>
<line>Made impudent with use of evil deeds,</line>
<line>I would assay, proud queen, to make thee blush.</line>
<line>To tell thee whence thou cam&#8217;st, of whom deriv&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Were shame enough to shame thee, wert thou not shameless.</line>
<line>Thy father bears the type of King of Naples,</line>
<line>Of both the Sicils and Jerusalem,</line>
<line>Yet not so wealthy as an English yeoman.</line>
<line>Hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult?</line>
<line>It needs not, nor it boots thee not, proud queen,</line>
<line>Unless the adage must be verified,</line>
<line>That beggars mounted run their horse to death.</line>
<line>&#8217;Tis beauty that doth oft make women proud,</line>
<line>But God he knows thy share thereof is small.</line>
<line>&#8217;Tis virtue that doth make them most admir&#8217;d,</line>
<line>The contrary doth make thee wond&#8217;red at.</line>
<line>&#8217;Tis government that makes them seem divine,</line>
<line>The want thereof makes thee abominable.</line>
<line>Thou art as opposite to every good</line>
<line>As the antipodes are unto us,</line>
<line>Or as the south to the septentrion.</line>
<line>O tiger&#8217;s heart wrapp&#8217;d in a woman&#8217;s hide!</line>
<line>How couldst thou drain the life-blood of the child,</line>
<line>To bid the father wipe his eyes withal,</line>
<line>And yet be seen to wear a woman&#8217;s face?</line>
<line>Women are soft, mild, pitiful, and flexible;</line>
<line>Thou stern, obdurate, flinty, rough, remorseless.</line>
<line>Bid&#8217;st thou me rage? Why, now thou hast thy wish:</line>
<line>Wouldst have me weep? Why, now thou hast thy will:</line>
<line>For raging wind blows up incessant showers,</line>
<line>And when the rage allays, the rain begins.</line>
<line>These tears are my sweet Rutland&#8217;s obsequies,</line>
<line>And every drop cries vengeance for his death</line>
<line>&#8217;Gainst thee, fell Clifford, and thee, false Frenchwoman.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NORTH.</speaker>
<line>Beshrew me, but his passions moves me so</line>
<line>That hardly can I check my eyes from tears.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>YORK.</speaker>
<line>That face of his the hungry cannibals</line>
<line>Would not have touch&#8217;d, would not have stain&#8217;d with blood;</line>

<line>O, ten times more, than tigers of Hyrcania.</line>
<line>See, ruthless queen, a hapless father&#8217;s tears!</line>
<line>This cloth thou dipp&#8217;dst in blood of my sweet boy,</line>
<line>And I with tears do wash the blood away.</line>
<line>Keep thou the napkin and go boast of this,</line>
<line>And if thou tell&#8217;st the heavy story right,</line>
<line>Upon my soul, the hearers will shed tears;</line>
<line>Yea, even my foes will shed fast-falling tears,</line>
<line>And say, &#8220;Alas, it was a piteous deed!&#8221;</line>
<line>There, take the crown, and with the crown, my curse,</line>
<line>And in thy need such comfort come to thee</line>
<line>As now I reap at thy too cruel hand!</line>
<line>Hard-hearted Clifford, take me from the world,</line>

<line>Or whether he be scap&#8217;d away or no</line>
<line>From Clifford&#8217;s and Northumberland&#8217;s pursuit.</line>
<line>Had he been ta&#8217;en, we should have heard the news;</line>
<line>Had he been slain, we should have heard the news;</line>
<line>Or had he scap&#8217;d, methinks we should have heard</line>
<line>The happy tidings of his good escape.</line>
<line>How fares my brother? Why is he so sad?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>RICH.</speaker>
<line>I cannot joy, until I be resolv&#8217;d</line>
<line>Where our right valiant father is become.</line>
<line>I saw him in the battle range about,</line>
<line>And watch&#8217;d him how he singled Clifford forth.</line>
<line>Methought he bore him in the thickest troop</line>
<line>As doth a lion in a herd of neat,</line>
<line>Or as a bear, encompass&#8217;d round with dogs,</line>
<line>Who having pinch&#8217;d a few and made them cry,</line>
<line>The rest stand all aloof and bark at him.</line>
<line>So far&#8217;d our father with his enemies,</line>
<line>So fled his enemies my warlike father;</line>
<line>Methinks &#8217;tis prize enough to be his son.</line>

<stagedir>Three suns appear in the air.</stagedir>
<line>See how the morning opes her golden gates,</line>
<line>And takes her farewell of the glorious sun!</line>
<line>How well resembles it the prime of youth,</line>
<line>Trimm&#8217;d like a younker prancing to his love!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>EDW.</speaker>
<line>Dazzle mine eyes, or do I see three suns?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>RICH.</speaker>
<line>Three glorious suns, each one a perfect sun,</line>
<line>Not separated with the racking clouds,</line>
<line>But sever&#8217;d in a pale clear-shining sky.</line>
<line>See, see, they join, embrace, and seem to kiss,</line>
<line>As if they vow&#8217;d some league inviolable.</line>
<line>Now are they but one lamp, one light, one sun.</line>
<line>In this the heaven figures some event.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>EDW.</speaker>
<line>&#8217;Tis wondrous strange, the like yet never heard of.</line>
<line>I think it cites us, brother, to the field,</line>
<line>That we, the sons of brave Plantagenet,</line>
<line>Each one already blazing by our meeds,</line>
<line>Should notwithstanding join our lights together,</line>
<line>And over-shine the earth as this the world.</line>
<line>What e&#8217;er it bodes, henceforward will I bear</line>
<line>Upon my target three fair shining suns.</line>
</speech>

<speech>

<line>Nay, bear three daughters; by your leave I speak it,</line>
<line>You love the breeder better than the male.</line>
<stagedir>Enter Second Yorkist Messenger blowing.</stagedir>

<line>Some dreadful story hanging on thy tongue?</line>

<speech>
<speaker>2. YORK. MESS.</speaker>
<line>Ah, one that was a woeful looker-on</line>
<line>When as the noble Duke of York was slain,</line>
<line>Your princely father and my loving lord!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>EDW.</speaker>
<line>O, speak no more, for I have heard too much.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>RICH.</speaker>
<line>Say how he died, for I will hear it all.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. YORK. MESS.</speaker>
<line>Environed he was with many foes,</line>
<line>And stood against them, as the hope of Troy</line>
<line>Against the Greeks that would have ent&#8217;red Troy.</line>
<line>But Hercules himself must yield to odds;</line>
<line>And many strokes, though with a little axe,</line>
<line>Hews down and fells the hardest-timber&#8217;d oak.</line>
<line>By many hands your father was subdu&#8217;d,</line>
<line>But only slaught&#8217;red by the ireful arm</line>
<line>Of unrelenting Clifford and the Queen;</line>
<line>Who crown&#8217;d the gracious Duke in high despite,</line>
<line>Laugh&#8217;d in his face; and when with grief he wept,</line>
<line>The ruthless Queen gave him to dry his cheeks</line>
<line>A napkin steeped in the harmless blood</line>
<line>Of sweet young Rutland, by rough Clifford slain.</line>
<line>And after many scorns, many foul taunts,</line>
<line>They took his head, and on the gates of York</line>
<line>They set the same, and there it doth remain,</line>
<line>The saddest spectacle that e&#8217;er I view&#8217;d.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>EDW.</speaker>
<line>Sweet Duke of York, our prop to lean upon,</line>
<line>Now thou art gone we have no staff, no stay.</line>
<line>O Clifford, boist&#8217;rous Clifford, thou hast slain</line>
<line>The flow&#8217;r of Europe for his chevalry,</line>
<line>And treacherously hast thou vanquish&#8217;d him,</line>
<line>For hand to hand he would have vanquish&#8217;d thee.</line>
<line>Now my soul&#8217;s palace is become a prison;</line>
<line>Ah, would she break from hence, that this my body</line>
<line>Might in the ground be closed up in rest!</line>
<line>For never henceforth shall I joy again,</line>
<line>Never, O never, shall I see more joy!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>RICH.</speaker>
<line>I cannot weep; for all my body&#8217;s moisture</line>
<line>Scarce serves to quench my furnace-burning heart;</line>
<line>Nor can my tongue unload my heart&#8217;s great burden,</line>
<line>For self-same wind that I should speak withal</line>
<line>Is kindling coals that fires all my breast,</line>
<line>And burns me up with flames that tears would quench.</line>
<line>To weep is to make less the depth of grief:</line>
<line>Tears then for babes; blows and revenge for me.</line>
<line>Richard, I bear thy name, I&#8217;ll venge thy death,</line>
<line>Or die renowned by attempting it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>EDW.</speaker>
<line>His name that valiant duke hath left with thee;</line>
<line>His dukedom and his chair with me is left.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>RICH.</speaker>
<line>Nay, if thou be that princely eagle&#8217;s bird,</line>
<line>Show thy descent by gazing &#8217;gainst the sun;</line>
<line>For chair and dukedom, throne and kingdom say,</line>
<line>Either that is thine, or else thou wert not his.</line>

<speaker>WAR.</speaker>
<line>How now, fair lords? What fare? What news abroad?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>RICH.</speaker>
<line>Great Lord of Warwick, if we should recompt</line>
<line>Our baleful news, and at each word&#8217;s deliverance</line>
<line>Stab poniards in our flesh till all were told,</line>
<line>The words would add more anguish than the wounds.</line>
<line>O valiant lord, the Duke of York is slain!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>EDW.</speaker>
<line>O Warwick, Warwick, that Plantagenet,</line>
<line>Which held thee dearly as his soul&#8217;s redemption,</line>
<line>Is by the stern Lord Clifford done to death.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WAR.</speaker>
<line>Ten days ago I drown&#8217;d these news in tears;</line>
<line>And now, to add more measure to your woes,</line>
<line>I come to tell you things sith then befall&#8217;n.</line>
<line>After the bloody fray at Wakefield fought,</line>
<line>Where your brave father breath&#8217;d his latest gasp,</line>
<line>Tidings, as swiftly as the posts could run,</line>
<line>Were brought me of your loss and his depart.</line>
<line>I, then in London, keeper of the King,</line>
<line>Muster&#8217;d my soldiers, gathered flocks of friends,</line>
<line>And very well appointed, as I thought,</line>
<line>March&#8217;d toward Saint Albons to intercept the Queen,</line>
<line>Bearing the King in my behalf along;</line>
<line>For by my scouts I was advertised</line>
<line>That she was coming with a full intent</line>
<line>To dash our late decree in parliament</line>
<line>Touching King Henry&#8217;s oath and your succession.</line>
<line>Short tale to make, we at Saint Albons met,</line>
<line>Our battles join&#8217;d, and both sides fiercely fought;</line>
<line>But whether &#8217;twas the coldness of the King,</line>
<line>Who look&#8217;d full gently on his warlike queen,</line>
<line>That robb&#8217;d my soldiers of their heated spleen;</line>
<line>Or whether &#8217;twas report of her success,</line>
<line>Or more than common fear of Clifford&#8217;s rigor,</line>
<line>Who thunders to his captives blood and death,</line>
<line>I cannot judge: but, to conclude with truth,</line>
<line>Their weapons like to lightning came and went;</line>
<line>Our soldiers&#8217;, like the night-owl&#8217;s lazy flight,</line>
<line>Or like an idle thresher with a flail,</line>
<line>Fell gently down, as if they struck their friends.</line>
<line>I cheer&#8217;d them up with justice of our cause,</line>
<line>With promise of high pay and great rewards;</line>
<line>But all in vain, they had no heart to fight,</line>
<line>And we, in them, no hope to win the day,</line>
<line>So that we fled: the King unto the Queen;</line>
<line>Lord George your brother, Norfolk, and myself,</line>
<line>In haste, post-haste, are come to join with you;</line>
<line>For in the marches here we heard you were,</line>
<line>Making another head to fight again.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>EDW.</speaker>
<line>Where is the Duke of Norfolk, gentle Warwick?</line>
<line>And when came George from Burgundy to England?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WAR.</speaker>
<line>Some six miles off the Duke is with the soldiers,</line>
<line>And for your brother, he was lately sent</line>
<line>From your kind aunt, Duchess of Burgundy,</line>
<line>With aid of soldiers to this needful war.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>RICH.</speaker>
<line>&#8217;Twas odds, belike, when valiant Warwick fled:</line>
<line>Oft have I heard his praises in pursuit,</line>
<line>But ne&#8217;er till now his scandal of retire.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WAR.</speaker>
<line>Nor now my scandal, Richard, dost thou hear;</line>
<line>For thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine</line>
<line>Can pluck the diadem from faint Henry&#8217;s head,</line>
<line>And wring the aweful sceptre from his fist,</line>
<line>Were he as famous and as bold in war</line>
<line>As he is fam&#8217;d for mildness, peace, and prayer.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>RICH.</speaker>
<line>I know it well, Lord Warwick, blame me not.</line>
<line>&#8217;Tis love I bear thy glories make me speak.</line>
<line>But in this troublous time what&#8217;s to be done?</line>
<line>Shall we go throw away our coats of steel,</line>
<line>And wrap our bodies in black mourning gowns,</line>
<line>Numb&#8217;ring our Ave-Maries with our beads?</line>
<line>Or shall we on the helmets of our foes</line>
<line>Tell our devotion with revengeful arms?</line>
<line>If for the last, say ay, and to it, lords.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WAR.</speaker>
<line>Why, therefore Warwick came to seek you out,</line>
<line>And therefore comes my brother Montague.</line>
<line>Attend me, lords: the proud insulting Queen,</line>
<line>With Clifford and the haught Northumberland,</line>
<line>And of their feather many more proud birds,</line>
<line>Have wrought the easy-melting King like wax.</line>
<line>He swore consent to your succession,</line>
<line>His oath enrolled in the parliament;</line>
<line>And now to London all the crew are gone</line>
<line>To frustrate both his oath and what beside</line>
<line>May make against the house of Lancaster.</line>
<line>Their power, I think, is thirty thousand strong.</line>
<line>Now, if the help of Norfolk and myself,</line>
<line>With all the friends that thou, brave Earl of March,</line>
<line>Amongst the loving Welshmen canst procure,</line>
<line>Will but amount to five and twenty thousand,</line>
<line>Why, via! To London will we march,</line>
<line>And once again bestride our foaming steeds,</line>
<line>And once again cry &#8220;Charge!&#8221; upon our foes,</line>
<line>But never once again turn back and fly.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>RICH.</speaker>
<line>Ay, now methinks I hear great Warwick speak.</line>
<line>Ne&#8217;er may he live to see a sunshine day</line>
<line>That cries &#8220;Retire!&#8221; if Warwick bid him stay.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>EDW.</speaker>
<line>Lord Warwick, on thy shoulder will I lean,</line>
<line>And when thou fail&#8217;st (as God forbid the hour!)</line>
<line>Must Edward fall, which peril heaven forefend!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WAR.</speaker>
<line>No longer Earl of March, but Duke of York;</line>
<line>The next degree is England&#8217;s royal throne;</line>
<line>For King of England shalt thou be proclaim&#8217;d</line>
<line>In every borough as we pass along,</line>
<line>And he that throws not up his cap for joy</line>
<line>Shall for the fault make forfeit of his head.</line>
<line>King Edward, valiant Richard, Montague,</line>
<line>Stay we no longer, dreaming of renown,</line>
<line>But sound the trumpets, and about our task.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>RICH.</speaker>
<line>Then, Clifford, were thy heart as hard as steel,</line>
<line>As thou hast shown it flinty by thy deeds,</line>
<line>I come to pierce it, or to give thee mine.</line>

<line>Welcome, my lord, to this brave town of York.</line>

<line>My gracious liege, this too much lenity</line>
<line>And harmful pity must be laid aside.</line>
<line>To whom do lions cast their gentle looks?</line>
<line>Not to the beast that would usurp their den.</line>
<line>Whose hand is that the forest bear doth lick?</line>
<line>Not his that spoils her young before her face.</line>
<line>Who scapes the lurking serpent&#8217;s mortal sting?</line>
<line>Not he that sets his foot upon her back.</line>
<line>The smallest worm will turn, being trodden on,</line>
<line>And doves will peck in safeguard of their brood.</line>
<line>Ambitious York did level at thy crown,</line>
<line>Thou smiling while he knit his angry brows:</line>
<line>He, but a duke, would have his son a king,</line>
<line>And raise his issue like a loving sire;</line>
<line>Thou, being a king, blest with a goodly son,</line>
<line>Didst yield consent to disinherit him,</line>
<line>Which argued thee a most unloving father.</line>
<line>Unreasonable creatures feed their young,</line>
<line>And though man&#8217;s face be fearful to their eyes,</line>
<line>Yet in protection of their tender ones,</line>
<line>Who hath not seen them, even with those wings</line>
<line>Which sometime they have us&#8217;d with fearful flight,</line>

<line>And long hereafter say unto his child,</line>
<line>&#8220;What my great-grandfather and grandsire got,</line>
<line>My careless father fondly gave away&#8221;?</line>
<line>Ah, what a shame were this! Look on the boy,</line>

<line>And happy always was it for that son</line>
<line>Whose father for his hoarding went to hell?</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll leave my son my virtuous deeds behind,</line>

<line>For all the rest is held at such a rate</line>

<speech>
<speaker>RICH.</speaker>
<line>What, not an oath? Nay, then the world goes hard</line>
<line>When Clifford cannot spare his friends an oath.</line>
<line>I know by that he&#8217;s dead, and by my soul,</line>
<line>If this right hand would buy two hours&#8217; life</line>
<line>That I, in all despite, might rail at him,</line>
<line>This hand should chop it off; and with the issuing blood</line>
<line>Stifle the villain whose unstanched thirst</line>
<line>York and young Rutland could not satisfy.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WAR.</speaker>
<line>Ay, but he&#8217;s dead. Off with the traitor&#8217;s head,</line>
<line>And rear it in the place your father&#8217;s stands.</line>
<line>And now to London with triumphant march,</line>
<line>There to be crowned England&#8217;s royal king;</line>
<line>From whence shall Warwick cut the sea to France,</line>
<line>And ask the Lady Bona for thy queen.</line>
<line>So shalt thou sinow both these lands together,</line>
<line>And having France thy friend, thou shalt not dread</line>
<line>The scatt&#8217;red foe that hopes to rise again;</line>
<line>For though they cannot greatly sting to hurt,</line>
<line>Yet look to have them buzz to offend thine ears.</line>
<line>First will I see the coronation,</line>
<line>And then to Brittany I&#8217;ll cross the sea</line>
<line>To effect this marriage, so it please my lord.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>EDW.</speaker>
<line>Even as thou wilt, sweet Warwick, let it be;</line>

<line>Wherein thy counsel and consent is wanting.</line>
<line>Richard, I will create thee Duke of Gloucester,</line>
<line>And George, of Clarence. Warwick, as ourself,</line>
<line>Shall do and undo as him pleaseth best.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>RICH.</speaker>
<line>Let me be Duke of Clarence, George of Gloucester,</line>
<line>For Gloucester&#8217;s dukedom is too ominous.</line>
</speech>

<speech>

<line>Tut, that&#8217;s a foolish observation.</line>

<line>My queen and son are gone to France for aid;</line>
<line>And, as I hear, the great commanding Warwick</line>
<line>Is thither gone to crave the French king&#8217;s sister</line>
<line>To wife for Edward. If this news be true,</line>
<line>Poor queen and son, your labor is but lost;</line>
<line>For Warwick is a subtle orator,</line>
<line>And Lewis a prince soon won with moving words.</line>
<line>By this account then, Margaret may win him,</line>
<line>For she&#8217;s a woman to be pitied much.</line>
<line>Her sighs will make a batt&#8217;ry in his breast,</line>
<line>Her tears will pierce into a marble heart;</line>
<line>The tiger will be mild whiles she doth mourn;</line>
<line>And Nero will be tainted with remorse</line>
<line>To hear and see her plaints, her brinish tears.</line>
<line>Ay, but she&#8217;s come to beg; Warwick, to give:</line>
<line>She, on his left side, craving aid for Henry;</line>
<line>He, on his right, asking a wife for Edward.</line>
<line>She weeps, and says her Henry is depos&#8217;d;</line>
<line>He smiles, and says his Edward is install&#8217;d;</line>
<line>That she, poor wretch, for grief can speak no more;</line>
<line>Whiles Warwick tells his title, smooths the wrong,</line>
<line>Inferreth arguments of mighty strength,</line>
<line>And in conclusion wins the King from her</line>
<line>With promise of his sister and what else,</line>
<line>To strengthen and support King Edward&#8217;s place.</line>
<line>O Margaret, thus &#8217;twill be, and thou, poor soul,</line>

<line>Obeying with my wind when I do blow,</line>
<line>And yielding to another when it blows,</line>
<line>Commanded always by the greater gust,</line>
<line>Such is the lightness of you common men.</line>
<line>But do not break your oaths, for of that sin</line>
<line>My mild entreaty shall not make you guilty.</line>
<line>Go where you will, the King shall be commanded;</line>
<line>And be you kings: command, and I&#8217;ll obey.</line>

<line>We are true subjects to the King, King Edward.</line>

<line>Ay, Edward will use women honorably.</line>
<line>Would he were wasted, marrow, bones, and all,</line>
<line>That from his loins no hopeful branch may spring,</line>
<line>To cross me from the golden time I look for!</line>
<line>And yet, between my soul&#8217;s desire and me&#8212;</line>
<line>The lustful Edward&#8217;s title buried&#8212;</line>
<line>Is Clarence, Henry, and his son young Edward,</line>
<line>And all the unlook&#8217;d-for issue of their bodies</line>
<line>To take their rooms, ere I can place myself:</line>
<line>A cold premeditation for my purpose!</line>
<line>Why then I do but dream on sovereignty,</line>
<line>Like one that stands upon a promontory</line>
<line>And spies a far-off shore where he would tread,</line>
<line>Wishing his foot were equal with his eye,</line>
<line>And chides the sea that sunders him from thence,</line>
<line>Saying, he&#8217;ll lade it dry to have his way:</line>
<line>So do I wish the crown, being so far off,</line>
<line>And so I chide the means that keeps me from it,</line>
<line>And so, I say, I&#8217;ll cut the causes off,</line>
<line>Flattering me with impossibilities.</line>
<line>My eye&#8217;s too quick, my heart o&#8217;erweens too much,</line>
<line>Unless my hand and strength could equal them.</line>
<line>Well, say there is no kingdom then for Richard;</line>
<line>What other pleasure can the world afford?</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll make my heaven in a lady&#8217;s lap,</line>
<line>And deck my body in gay ornaments,</line>
<line>And witch sweet ladies with my words and looks.</line>
<line>O miserable thought! And more unlikely</line>
<line>Than to accomplish twenty golden crowns!</line>
<line>Why, love forswore me in my mother&#8217;s womb;</line>
<line>And for I should not deal in her soft laws,</line>
<line>She did corrupt frail nature with some bribe,</line>
<line>To shrink mine arm up like a wither&#8217;d shrub,</line>
<line>To make an envious mountain on my back,</line>
<line>Where sits deformity to mock my body;</line>
<line>To shape my legs of an unequal size,</line>
<line>To disproportion me in every part,</line>
<line>Like to a chaos, or an unlick&#8217;d bear-whelp</line>
<line>That carries no impression like the dam.</line>
<line>And am I then a man to be belov&#8217;d?</line>
<line>O monstrous fault, to harbor such a thought!</line>
<line>Then since this earth affords no joy to me</line>
<line>But to command, to check, to o&#8217;erbear such</line>
<line>As are of better person than myself,</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll make my heaven to dream upon the crown,</line>
<line>And whiles I live, t&#8217; account this world but hell,</line>
<line>Until my misshap&#8217;d trunk that bears this head</line>
<line>Be round impaled with a glorious crown.</line>
<line>And yet I know not how to get the crown,</line>
<line>For many lives stand between me and home;</line>
<line>And I&#8212;like one lost in a thorny wood,</line>
<line>That rents the thorns, and is rent with the thorns,</line>
<line>Seeking a way, and straying from the way,</line>
<line>Not knowing how to find the open air,</line>
<line>But toiling desperately to find it out&#8212;</line>
<line>Torment myself to catch the English crown;</line>
<line>And from that torment I will free myself,</line>
<line>Or hew my way out with a bloody axe.</line>
<line>Why, I can smile, and murder whiles I smile,</line>
<line>And cry &#8220;Content&#8221; to that which grieves my heart,</line>
<line>And wet my cheeks with artificial tears,</line>
<line>And frame my face to all occasions.</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll drown more sailors than the mermaid shall,</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll slay more gazers than the basilisk,</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll play the orator as well as Nestor,</line>
<line>Deceive more slily than Ulysses could,</line>
<line>And like a Sinon, take another Troy.</line>
<line>I can add colors to the chameleon,</line>
<line>Change shapes with Proteus for advantages,</line>
<line>And set the murderous Machevil to school.</line>
<line>Can I do this, and cannot get a crown?</line>
<line>Tut, were it farther off, I&#8217;ll pluck it down.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>K. LEW.</speaker>
<line>Fair Queen of England, worthy Margaret,</line>
<line>Sit down with us. It ill befits thy state</line>
<line>And birth that thou shouldst stand while Lewis doth sit.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. MAR.</speaker>
<line>No, mighty King of France; now Margaret</line>
<line>Must strike her sail and learn a while to serve</line>
<line>Where kings command. I was, I must confess,</line>
<line>Great Albion&#8217;s queen in former golden days;</line>
<line>But now mischance hath trod my title down,</line>
<line>And with dishonor laid me on the ground,</line>
<line>Where I must take like seat unto my fortune,</line>
<line>And to my humble seat conform myself.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. LEW.</speaker>
<line>Why, say, fair queen, whence springs this deep despair?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. MAR.</speaker>
<line>From such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears</line>
<line>And stops my tongue, while heart is drown&#8217;d in cares.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. LEW.</speaker>
<line>What e&#8217;er it be, be thou still like thyself,</line>
<line>And sit thee by our side.</line>

<stagedir>Seats her by him.</stagedir>
<line offset="5">Yield not thy neck</line>
<line>To fortune&#8217;s yoke, but let thy dauntless mind</line>

<line>Be plain, Queen Margaret, and tell thy grief;</line>
<line>It shall be eas&#8217;d if France can yield relief.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. MAR.</speaker>
<line>Those gracious words revive my drooping thoughts</line>
<line>And give my tongue-tied sorrows leave to speak.</line>
<line>Now therefore be it known to noble Lewis,</line>
<line>That Henry, sole possessor of my love,</line>

<line>And forc&#8217;d to live in Scotland a forlorn;</line>
<line>While proud ambitious Edward, Duke of York,</line>
<line>Usurps the regal title and the seat</line>
<line>Of England&#8217;s true-anointed lawful king.</line>
<line>This is the cause that I, poor Margaret,</line>
<line>With this my son, Prince Edward, Henry&#8217;s heir,</line>
<line>Am come to crave thy just and lawful aid;</line>
<line>And if thou fail us, all our hope is done.</line>
<line>Scotland hath will to help, but cannot help;</line>
<line>Our people and our peers are both misled,</line>
<line>Our treasure seiz&#8217;d, our soldiers put to flight,</line>
<line>And as thou seest, ourselves in heavy plight.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. LEW.</speaker>
<line>Renowned queen, with patience calm the storm,</line>

<speech>
<speaker>K. LEW.</speaker>
<line>What&#8217;s he approacheth boldly to our presence?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. MAR.</speaker>
<line>Our Earl of Warwick, Edward&#8217;s greatest friend.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. LEW.</speaker>
<line>Welcome, brave Warwick! What brings thee to France?</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>He descends. She ariseth.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. MAR.</speaker>
<line>Ay, now begins a second storm to rise,</line>
<line>For this is he that moves both wind and tide.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WAR.</speaker>
<line>From worthy Edward, King of Albion,</line>
<line>My lord and sovereign and thy vowed friend,</line>
<line>I come, in kindness and unfeigned love,</line>
<line>First, to do greetings to thy royal person,</line>
<line>And then to crave a league of amity,</line>
<line>And lastly, to confirm that amity</line>
<line>With nuptial knot, if thou vouchsafe to grant</line>
<line>That virtuous Lady Bona, thy fair sister,</line>
<line>To England&#8217;s king in lawful marriage.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. MAR.</speaker>
<stagedir>Aside.</stagedir>
<line>If that go forward, Henry&#8217;s hope is done.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WAR.</speaker>
<line>And, gracious madam</line>

<stagedir>Speaking to Lady Bona.</stagedir>
<line offset="5">in our king&#8217;s behalf</line>
<line>I am commanded, with your leave and favor,</line>
<line>Humbly to kiss your hand, and with my tongue</line>
<line>To tell the passion of my sovereign&#8217;s heart,</line>
<line>Where fame, late ent&#8217;ring at his heedful ears,</line>
<line>Hath plac&#8217;d thy beauty&#8217;s image and thy virtue.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. MAR.</speaker>
<line>King Lewis and Lady Bona, hear me speak</line>
<line>Before you answer Warwick. His demand</line>
<line>Springs not from Edward&#8217;s well-meant honest love,</line>
<line>But from deceit bred by necessity;</line>
<line>For how can tyrants safely govern home,</line>
<line>Unless abroad they purchase great alliance?</line>
<line>To prove him tyrant this reason may suffice,</line>
<line>That Henry liveth still; but were he dead,</line>
<line>Yet here Prince Edward stands, King Henry&#8217;s son.</line>
<line>Look therefore, Lewis, that by this league and marriage</line>
<line>Thou draw not on thy danger and dishonor;</line>
<line>For though usurpers sway the rule a while,</line>
<line>Yet heav&#8217;ns are just, and time suppresseth wrongs.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WAR.</speaker>
<line>Injurious Margaret!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRINCE.</speaker>
<line offset="4">And why not Queen?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WAR.</speaker>
<line>Because thy father Henry did usurp,</line>
<line>And thou no more art prince than she is queen.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OXF.</speaker>
<line>Then Warwick disannuls great John of Gaunt,</line>
<line>Which did subdue the greatest part of Spain;</line>
<line>And after John of Gaunt, Henry the Fourth,</line>
<line>Whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest;</line>
<line>And after that wise prince, Henry the Fifth,</line>
<line>Who by his prowess conquered all France:</line>
<line>From these our Henry lineally descends.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WAR.</speaker>
<line>Oxford, how haps it in this smooth discourse</line>
<line>You told not how Henry the Sixth hath lost</line>
<line>All that which Henry the Fifth had gotten?</line>
<line>Methinks these peers of France should smile at that.</line>
<line>But for the rest: you tell a pedigree</line>
<line>Of threescore and two years&#8212;a silly time</line>
<line>To make prescription for a kingdom&#8217;s worth.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OXF.</speaker>
<line>Why, Warwick, canst thou speak against thy liege,</line>
<line>Whom thou obey&#8217;dst thirty and six years,</line>
<line>And not bewray thy treason with a blush?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WAR.</speaker>
<line>Can Oxford, that did ever fence the right,</line>
<line>Now buckler falsehood with a pedigree?</line>
<line>For shame, leave Henry, and call Edward king.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OXF.</speaker>
<line>Call him my king by whose injurious doom</line>
<line>My elder brother, the Lord Aubrey Vere,</line>
<line>Was done to death? And more than so, my father,</line>
<line>Even in the downfall of his mellow&#8217;d years,</line>
<line>When nature brought him to the door of death?</line>
<line>No, Warwick, no; while life upholds this arm,</line>
<line>This arm upholds the house of Lancaster.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WAR.</speaker>
<line>And I the house of York.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. LEW.</speaker>
<line>Queen Margaret, Prince Edward, and Oxford,</line>
<line>Vouchsafe, at our request, to stand aside,</line>
<line>While I use further conference with Warwick.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>They stand aloof.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. MAR.</speaker>
<line>Heavens grant that Warwick&#8217;s words bewitch him not!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. LEW.</speaker>
<line>Now, Warwick, tell me, even upon thy conscience,</line>
<line>Is Edward your true king? For I were loath</line>
<line>To link with him that were not lawful chosen.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WAR.</speaker>
<line>Thereon I pawn my credit and mine honor.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. LEW.</speaker>
<line>But is he gracious in the people&#8217;s eye?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WAR.</speaker>
<line>The more that Henry was unfortunate.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. LEW.</speaker>
<line>Then further: all dissembling set aside,</line>
<line>Tell me for truth the measure of his love</line>
<line>Unto our sister Bona.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WAR.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Such it seems</line>
<line>As may beseem a monarch like himself.</line>
<line>Myself have often heard him say, and swear,</line>
<line>That this his love was an eternal plant,</line>
<line>Whereof the root was fix&#8217;d in virtue&#8217;s ground,</line>
<line>The leaves and fruit maintain&#8217;d with beauty&#8217;s sun,</line>
<line>Exempt from envy, but not from disdain,</line>
<line>Unless the Lady Bona quit his pain.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. LEW.</speaker>
<line>Now, sister, let us hear your firm resolve.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BONA.</speaker>
<line>Your grant, or your denial, shall be mine.</line>
<line>Yet I confess that often ere this day,</line>

<stagedir>Speaks to Warwick.</stagedir>
<line>When I have heard your king&#8217;s desert recounted,</line>
<line>Mine ear hath tempted judgment to desire.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. LEW.</speaker>
<line>Then, Warwick, thus: our sister shall be Edward&#8217;s.</line>
<line>And now forthwith shall articles be drawn</line>
<line>Touching the jointure that your king must make,</line>
<line>Which with her dowry shall be counterpois&#8217;d.</line>
<line>Draw near, Queen Margaret, and be a witness</line>
<line>That Bona shall be wife to the English king.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRINCE.</speaker>
<line>To Edward, but not to the English king.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. MAR.</speaker>
<line>Deceitful Warwick, it was thy device</line>
<line>By this alliance to make void my suit.</line>
<line>Before thy coming, Lewis was Henry&#8217;s friend.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. LEW.</speaker>
<line>And still is friend to him and Margaret.</line>
<line>But if your title to the crown be weak,</line>
<line>As may appear by Edward&#8217;s good success,</line>
<line>Then &#8217;tis but reason that I be releas&#8217;d</line>
<line>From giving aid which late I promised.</line>
<line>Yet shall you have all kindness at my hand</line>
<line>That your estate requires and mine can yield.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WAR.</speaker>
<line>Henry now lives in Scotland at his ease;</line>
<line>Where having nothing, nothing can he lose.</line>
<line>And as for you yourself, our quondam queen,</line>
<line>You have a father able to maintain you,</line>
<line>And better &#8217;twere you troubled him than France.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. MAR.</speaker>
<line>Peace, impudent and shameless Warwick,</line>
<line>Proud setter-up and puller-down of kings!</line>
<line>I will not hence, till with my talk and tears</line>
<line>(Both full of truth) I make King Lewis behold</line>
<line>Thy sly conveyance and thy lord&#8217;s false love,</line>
<line>For both of you are birds of self-same feather.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Post blowing a horn within.</stagedir>

<line>Warwick, this is some post to us or thee.</line>

<line>My lord ambassador, these letters are for you,</line>

<stagedir>Speaks to Warwick.</stagedir>
<line>Sent from your brother, Marquess Montague.</line>
<line>These from our king unto your Majesty.</line>

<stagedir>To Lewis.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>PRINCE.</speaker>
<line>Nay, mark how Lewis stamps as he were nettled.</line>
<line>I hope all&#8217;s for the best.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. LEW.</speaker>
<line>Warwick, what are thy news? And yours, fair queen?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. MAR.</speaker>
<line>Mine such as fill my heart with unhop&#8217;d joys.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WAR.</speaker>
<line>Mine full of sorrow and heart&#8217;s discontent.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. LEW.</speaker>
<line>What? Has your king married the Lady Grey?</line>
<line>And now to soothe your forgery and his,</line>
<line>Sends me a paper to persuade me patience?</line>
<line>Is this th&#8217; alliance that he seeks with France?</line>
<line>Dare he presume to scorn us in this manner?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. MAR.</speaker>
<line>I told your Majesty as much before:</line>
<line>This proveth Edward&#8217;s love and Warwick&#8217;s honesty.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WAR.</speaker>
<line>King Lewis, I here protest in sight of heaven,</line>
<line>And by the hope I have of heavenly bliss,</line>
<line>That I am clear from this misdeed of Edward&#8217;s;</line>
<line>No more my king, for he dishonors me,</line>
<line>But most himself if he could see his shame.</line>
<line>Did I forget that by the house of York</line>
<line>My father came untimely to his death?</line>
<line>Did I let pass th&#8217; abuse done to my niece?</line>
<line>Did I impale him with the regal crown?</line>
<line>Did I put Henry from his native right?</line>
<line>And am I guerdon&#8217;d at the last with shame?</line>
<line>Shame on himself! For my desert is honor;</line>
<line>And to repair my honor lost for him,</line>
<line>I here renounce him and return to Henry.</line>
<line>My noble queen, let former grudges pass,</line>
<line>And henceforth I am thy true servitor.</line>
<line>I will revenge his wrong to Lady Bona,</line>
<line>And replant Henry in his former state.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. MAR.</speaker>
<line>Warwick, these words have turn&#8217;d my hate to love,</line>
<line>And I forgive and quite forget old faults,</line>
<line>And joy that thou becom&#8217;st King Henry&#8217;s friend.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WAR.</speaker>
<line>So much his friend, ay, his unfeigned friend,</line>
<line>That if King Lewis vouchsafe to furnish us</line>
<line>With some few bands of chosen soldiers,</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll undertake to land them on our coast,</line>
<line>And force the tyrant from his seat by war.</line>
<line>&#8217;Tis not his new-made bride shall succor him,</line>
<line>And as for Clarence, as my letters tell me,</line>
<line>He&#8217;s very likely now to fall from him,</line>
<line>For matching more for wanton lust than honor,</line>
<line>Or than for strength and safety of our country.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BONA.</speaker>
<line>Dear brother, how shall Bona be reveng&#8217;d</line>
<line>But by thy help to this distressed queen?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. MAR.</speaker>
<line>Renowned prince, how shall poor Henry live,</line>
<line>Unless thou rescue him from foul despair?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BONA.</speaker>
<line>My quarrel and this English queen&#8217;s are one.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WAR.</speaker>
<line>And mine, fair Lady Bona, joins with yours.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. LEW.</speaker>
<line>And mine with hers, and thine, and Margaret&#8217;s.</line>
<line>Therefore, at last, I firmly am resolv&#8217;d</line>
<line>You shall have aid.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. MAR.</speaker>
<line>Let me give humble thanks for all at once.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>K. LEW.</speaker>
<line>Then, England&#8217;s messenger, return in post,</line>
<line>And tell false Edward, thy supposed king,</line>
<line>That Lewis of France is sending over masquers</line>
<line>To revel it with him and his new bride.</line>
<line>Thou seest what&#8217;s pass&#8217;d, go fear thy king withal.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BONA.</speaker>
<line>Tell him, in hope he&#8217;ll prove a widower shortly,</line>
<line>I wear the willow garland for his sake.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. MAR.</speaker>
<line>Tell him, my mourning weeds are laid aside,</line>
<line>And I am ready to put armor on.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WAR.</speaker>
<line>Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong,</line>
<line>And therefore I&#8217;ll uncrown him ere&#8217;t be long.</line>
<line>There&#8217;s thy reward, be gone.</line>

<speaker>K. LEW.</speaker>
<line offset="6">But, Warwick,</line>
<line>Thou and Oxford, with five thousand men,</line>

<line>Yet ere thou go, but answer me one doubt:</line>
<line>What pledge have we of thy firm loyalty?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>WAR.</speaker>
<line>This shall assure my constant loyalty,</line>
<line>That if our queen and this young prince agree,</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll join mine eldest daughter, and my joy,</line>
<line>To him forthwith in holy wedlock bands.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>Q. MAR.</speaker>
<line>Yes, I agree, and thank you for your motion.</line>
<line>Son Edward, she is fair and virtuous,</line>
<line>Therefore delay not, give thy hand to Warwick,</line>

<speech>
<speaker>CLAR.</speaker>
<line>As well as Lewis of France or the Earl of Warwick,</line>
<line>Which are so weak of courage and in judgment</line>
<line>That they&#8217;ll take no offense at our abuse.</line>

<speaker alias="EDW.">K. EDW.</speaker>
<line>Suppose they take offense without a cause;</line>
<line>They are but Lewis and Warwick, I am Edward,</line>

<line>What if both Lewis and Warwick be appeas&#8217;d</line>
<line>By such invention as I can devise?</line>

<line>Yet, to have join&#8217;d with France in such alliance</line>

<line>Now, my Lord Hastings and Sir William Stanley,</line>
<line>Leave off to wonder why I drew you hither</line>
<line>Into this chiefest thicket of the park.</line>
<line>Thus stands the case: you know our king, my brother,</line>

<line>He hath good usage and great liberty,</line>
<line>And often but attended with weak guard,</line>
<line>Comes hunting this way to disport himself.</line>

<line>We will not from the helm to sit and weep,</line>

<line>Canst thou not speak? O traitors, murderers!</line>
<line>They that stabb&#8217;d Caesar shed no blood at all,</line>
<line>Did not offend, nor were not worthy blame,</line>
<line>If this foul deed were by to equal it.</line>
<line>He was a man; this, in respect, a child,</line>

<line>What&#8217;s worse than murderer, that I may name it?</line>

<line>What, wilt thou not? Where is that devil&#8217;s butcher,</line>

<line>Ay, my good lord&#8212;my lord, I should say rather.</line>

<line>Down, down to hell, and say I sent thee thither&#8212;</line>

<stagedir>Stabs him again.</stagedir>
<line>I, that have neither pity, love, nor fear.</line>
<line>Indeed &#8217;tis true that Henry told me of;</line>
<line>For I have often heard my mother say</line>
<line>I came into the world with my legs forward.</line>
<line>Had I not reason, think ye, to make haste,</line>
<line>And seek their ruin that usurp&#8217;d our right?</line>
<line>The midwife wonder&#8217;d and the women cried,</line>
<line>&#8220;O, Jesus bless us, he is born with teeth!&#8221;</line>

<line>Clarence, beware! Thou keep&#8217;st me from the light,</line>

<line>King Henry and the Prince his son are gone;</line>
<line>Clarence, thy turn is next, and then the rest,</line>
