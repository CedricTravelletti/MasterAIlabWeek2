<STAGEDIR>Alarum. Enter Richard Plantagenet, The Duke of York, Edward, Richard, Norfolk, Montague, Warwick, with Drum and Soldiers, with white roses in their hats.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I wonder how the King escap&#8217;d our hands.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>While we pursu&#8217;d the horsemen of the north,</LINE>
<LINE>He slily stole away and left his men;</LINE>
<LINE>Whereat the great Lord of Northumberland,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose warlike ears could never brook retreat,</LINE>
<LINE>Cheer&#8217;d up the drooping army, and himself,</LINE>
<LINE>Lord Clifford, and Lord Stafford, all abreast,</LINE>
<LINE>Charg&#8217;d our main battle&#8217;s front; and breaking in,</LINE>
<LINE>Were by the swords of common soldiers slain.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDW.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Lord Stafford&#8217;s father, Duke of Buckingham,</LINE>
<LINE>Is either slain or wounded dangerous;</LINE>
<LINE>I cleft his beaver with a downright blow.</LINE>
<LINE>That this is true, father, behold his blood.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MONT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And, brother, here&#8217;s the Earl of Wiltshire&#8217;s blood,</LINE>
<LINE>Whom I encount&#8217;red as the battles join&#8217;d.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Speak thou for me and tell them what I did.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Showing the Duke of Somerset&#8217;s head.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Richard hath best deserv&#8217;d of all my sons.</LINE>
<LINE>But is your Grace dead, my Lord of Somerset?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NORF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Such hope have all the line of John of Gaunt!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thus do I hope to shake King Henry&#8217;s head.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And so do I, victorious prince of York.</LINE>
<LINE>Before I see thee seated in that throne</LINE>
<LINE>Which now the house of Lancaster usurps,</LINE>
<LINE>I vow by heaven these eyes shall never close.</LINE>
<LINE>This is the palace of the fearful king,</LINE>
<LINE>And this the regal seat. Possess it, York,</LINE>
<LINE>For this is thine and not King Henry&#8217;s heirs&#8217;.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Assist me then, sweet Warwick, and I will,</LINE>
<LINE>For hither we have broken in by force.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NORF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We&#8217;ll all assist you; he that flies shall die.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thanks, gentle Norfolk. Stay by me, my lords,</LINE>
<LINE>And, soldiers, stay and lodge by me this night.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>They go up.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And when the King comes, offer him no violence,</LINE>
<LINE>Unless he seek to thrust you out perforce.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The Queen this day here holds her parliament,</LINE>
<LINE>But little thinks we shall be of her council.</LINE>
<LINE>By words or blows here let us win our right.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Arm&#8217;d as we are, let&#8217;s stay within this house.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The bloody parliament shall this be call&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Unless Plantagenet, Duke of York, be king,</LINE>
<LINE>And bashful Henry depos&#8217;d, whose cowardice</LINE>
<LINE>Hath made us by-words to our enemies.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then leave me not, my lords, be resolute,</LINE>
<LINE>I mean to take possession of my right.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Neither the King, nor he that loves him best,</LINE>
<LINE>The proudest he that holds up Lancaster,</LINE>
<LINE>Dares stir a wing if Warwick shake his bells.</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll plant Plantagenet, root him up who dares.</LINE>
<LINE>Resolve thee, Richard, claim the English crown.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>York takes the throne.</STAGEDIR>

<STAGEDIR>Flourish. Enter King Henry, Clifford, Northumberland, Westmorland, Exeter, and the rest, with red roses in their hats.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. HEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lords, look where the sturdy rebel sits,</LINE>
<LINE>Even in the chair of state. Belike he means,</LINE>
<LINE>Back&#8217;d by the power of Warwick, that false peer,</LINE>
<LINE>To aspire unto the crown and reign as king.</LINE>
<LINE>Earl of Northumberland, he slew thy father,</LINE>
<LINE>And thine, Lord Clifford, and you both have vow&#8217;d revenge</LINE>
<LINE>On him, his sons, his favorites, and his friends.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NORTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If I be not, heavens be reveng&#8217;d on me!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLIF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The hope thereof makes Clifford mourn in steel.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WEST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, shall we suffer this? Let&#8217;s pluck him down.</LINE>
<LINE>My heart for anger burns, I cannot brook it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. HEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Be patient, gentle Earl of Westmorland.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLIF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Patience is for poltroons, such as he.</LINE>
<LINE>He durst not sit there, had your father liv&#8217;d.</LINE>
<LINE>My gracious lord, here in the parliament</LINE>
<LINE>Let us assail the family of York.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NORTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well hast thou spoken, cousin, be it so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. HEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ah, know you not the city favors them,</LINE>
<LINE>And they have troops of soldiers at their beck?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EXE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But when the Duke is slain, they&#8217;ll quickly fly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. HEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Far be the thought of this from Henry&#8217;s heart,</LINE>
<LINE>To make a shambles of the parliament house!</LINE>
<LINE>Cousin of Exeter, frowns, words, and threats</LINE>
<LINE>Shall be the war that Henry means to use.</LINE>
<LINE>Thou factious Duke of York, descend my throne,</LINE>
<LINE>And kneel for grace and mercy at my feet:</LINE>
<LINE>I am thy sovereign.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">I am thine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EXE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For shame, come down. He made thee Duke of York.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It was my inheritance, as the earldom was.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EXE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thy father was a traitor to the crown.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Exeter, thou art a traitor to the crown,</LINE>
<LINE>In following this usurping Henry.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLIF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Whom should he follow but his natural king?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>True, Clifford, that&#8217;s Richard Duke of York.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. HEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And shall I stand, and thou sit in my throne?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It must and shall be so. Content thyself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Be Duke of Lancaster, let him be King.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WEST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He is both King and Duke of Lancaster,</LINE>
<LINE>And that the Lord of Westmorland shall maintain.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And Warwick shall disprove it. You forget</LINE>
<LINE>That we are those which chas&#8217;d you from the field,</LINE>
<LINE>And slew your fathers, and with colors spread</LINE>
<LINE>March&#8217;d through the city to the palace gates.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NORTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, Warwick, I remember it to my grief,</LINE>
<LINE>And by his soul, thou and thy house shall rue it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WEST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Plantagenet, of thee and these thy sons,</LINE>
<LINE>Thy kinsmen and thy friends, I&#8217;ll have more lives</LINE>
<LINE>Than drops of blood were in my father&#8217;s veins.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLIF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Urge it no more, lest that, in stead of words,</LINE>
<LINE>I send thee, Warwick, such a messenger</LINE>
<LINE>As shall revenge his death before I stir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Poor Clifford, how I scorn his worthless threats!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Will you we show our title to the crown?</LINE>
<LINE>If not, our swords shall plead it in the field.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. HEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What title hast thou, traitor, to the crown?</LINE>
<LINE>Thy father was, as thou art, Duke of York,</LINE>
<LINE>Thy grandfather, Roger Mortimer, Earl of March:</LINE>
<LINE>I am the son of Henry the Fifth,</LINE>
<LINE>Who made the Dauphin and the French to stoop,</LINE>
<LINE>And seiz&#8217;d upon their towns and provinces.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Talk not of France, sith thou hast lost it all.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. HEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The Lord Protector lost it, and not I;</LINE>
<LINE>When I was crown&#8217;d I was but nine months old.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You are old enough now, and yet methinks you lose.</LINE>
<LINE>Father, tear the crown from the usurper&#8217;s head.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDW.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sweet father, do so, set it on your head.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MONT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good brother, as thou lov&#8217;st and honorest arms,</LINE>
<LINE>Let&#8217;s fight it out, and not stand cavilling thus.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sound drums and trumpets, and the King will fly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sons, peace!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. HEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Peace thou! And give King Henry leave to speak.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Plantagenet shall speak first. Hear him, lords,</LINE>
<LINE>And be you silent and attentive too,</LINE>
<LINE>For he that interrupts him shall not live.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. HEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Think&#8217;st thou that I will leave my kingly throne,</LINE>
<LINE>Wherein my grandsire and my father sat?</LINE>
<LINE>No; first shall war unpeople this my realm;</LINE>
<LINE>Ay, and their colors, often borne in France,</LINE>
<LINE>And now in England to our heart&#8217;s great sorrow,</LINE>
<LINE>Shall be my winding-sheet. Why faint you, lords?</LINE>
<LINE>My title&#8217;s good, and better far than his.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Prove it, Henry, and thou shalt be King.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. HEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Henry the Fourth by conquest got the crown.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;Twas by rebellion against his king.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. HEN.</SPEAKER>
<STAGEDIR>Aside.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>I know not what to say, my title&#8217;s weak.&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Tell me, may not a king adopt an heir?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What then?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. HEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And if he may, then am I lawful king;</LINE>
<LINE>For Richard, in the view of many lords,</LINE>
<LINE>Resign&#8217;d the crown to Henry the Fourth,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose heir my father was, and I am his.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He rose against him, being his sovereign,</LINE>
<LINE>And made him to resign his crown perforce.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Suppose, my lords, he did it unconstrain&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Think you &#8217;twere prejudicial to his crown?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EXE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No; for he could not so resign his crown</LINE>
<LINE>But that the next heir should succeed and reign.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. HEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Art thou against us, Duke of Exeter?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EXE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>His is the right, and therefore pardon me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why whisper you, my lords, and answer not?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EXE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My conscience tells me he is lawful king.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. HEN.</SPEAKER>
<STAGEDIR>Aside.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>All will revolt from me and turn to him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NORTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Plantagenet, for all the claim thou lay&#8217;st,</LINE>
<LINE>Think not that Henry shall be so depos&#8217;d.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Depos&#8217;d he shall be, in despite of all.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NORTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou art deceiv&#8217;d. &#8217;Tis not thy southern power</LINE>
<LINE>Of Essex, Norfolk, Suffolk, nor of Kent,</LINE>
<LINE>Which makes thee thus presumptuous and proud,</LINE>
<LINE>Can set the Duke up in despite of me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLIF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>King Henry, be thy title right or wrong,</LINE>
<LINE>Lord Clifford vows to fight in thy defense.</LINE>
<LINE>May that ground gape, and swallow me alive,</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. HEN.</SPEAKER>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>What mutter you, or what conspire you, lords?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do right unto this princely Duke of York,</LINE>
<LINE>Or I will fill the house with armed men,</LINE>
<LINE>And over the chair of state, where now he sits,</LINE>
<LINE>Write up his title with usurping blood.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>He stamps with his foot, and the Soldiers show themselves.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. HEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My Lord of Warwick, hear but one word:</LINE>
<LINE>Let me for this my lifetime reign as king.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK.</SPEAKER>

<LINE>Nay, go not from me, I will follow thee.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. HEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Be patient, gentle queen, and I will stay.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Q. MAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who can be patient in such extremes?</LINE>
<LINE>Ah, wretched man, would I had died a maid</LINE>
<LINE>And never seen thee, never borne thee son,</LINE>
<LINE>Seeing thou hast prov&#8217;d so unnatural a father!</LINE>
<LINE>Hath he deserv&#8217;d to lose his birthright thus?</LINE>
<LINE>Hadst thou but lov&#8217;d him half so well as I,</LINE>
<LINE>Or felt that pain which I did for him once,</LINE>
<LINE>Or nourish&#8217;d him as I did with my blood,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou wouldst have left thy dearest heart-blood there</LINE>
<LINE>Rather than have made that savage duke thine heir,</LINE>
<LINE>And disinherited thine only son.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Father, you cannot disinherit me.</LINE>
<LINE>If you be king, why should not I succeed?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. HEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pardon me, Margaret, pardon me, sweet son,</LINE>
<LINE>The Earl of Warwick and the Duke enforc&#8217;d me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Q. MAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Enforc&#8217;d thee? Art thou king, and wilt be forc&#8217;d?</LINE>
<LINE>I shame to hear thee speak. Ah, timorous wretch,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou hast undone thyself, thy son, and me,</LINE>
<LINE>And giv&#8217;n unto the house of York such head</LINE>
<LINE>As thou shalt reign but by their sufferance.</LINE>
<LINE>To entail him and his heirs unto the crown,</LINE>
<LINE>What is it, but to make thy sepulchre,</LINE>
<LINE>And creep into it far before thy time?</LINE>
<LINE>Warwick is chancellor and the lord of Callice,</LINE>
<LINE>Stern Falconbridge commands the Narrow Seas,</LINE>
<LINE>The Duke is made Protector of the realm,</LINE>
<LINE>And yet shalt thou be safe? Such safety finds</LINE>
<LINE>The trembling lamb environed with wolves.</LINE>
<LINE>Had I been there, which am a silly woman,</LINE>
<LINE>The soldiers should have toss&#8217;d me on their pikes,</LINE>
<LINE>Before I would have granted to that act.</LINE>
<LINE>But thou prefer&#8217;st thy life before thine honor;</LINE>
<LINE>And seeing thou dost, I here divorce myself</LINE>
<LINE>Both from thy table, Henry, and thy bed,</LINE>
<LINE>Until that act of parliament be repeal&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>Whereby my son is disinherited.</LINE>
<LINE>The northern lords that have forsworn thy colors</LINE>
<LINE>Will follow mine, if once they see them spread;</LINE>
<LINE>And spread they shall be, to thy foul disgrace,</LINE>
<LINE>And utter ruin of the house of York.</LINE>
<LINE>Thus do I leave thee. Come, son, let&#8217;s away.</LINE>

<LINE>Poor queen, how love to me and to her son</LINE>

<LINE>Reveng&#8217;d may she be on that hateful duke,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose haughty spirit, winged with desire,</LINE>
<LINE>Will cost my crown, and like an empty eagle</LINE>
<LINE>Tire on the flesh of me and of my son!</LINE>
<LINE>The loss of those three lords torments my heart;</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll write unto them and entreat them fair;</LINE>
<LINE>Come, cousin, you shall be the messenger.</LINE>

<LINE>Why, how now, sons and brother, at a strife?</LINE>

<LINE>No quarrel, but a slight contention.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>About what?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>About that which concerns your Grace and us:</LINE>

<LINE>Now you are heir, therefore enjoy it now.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I took an oath that he should quietly reign.</LINE>

<LINE>An oath is of no moment, being not took</LINE>
<LINE>Before a true and lawful magistrate</LINE>
<LINE>That hath authority over him that swears.</LINE>
<LINE>Henry had none, but did usurp the place.</LINE>
<LINE>Then seeing &#8217;twas he that made you to depose,</LINE>
<LINE>Your oath, my lord, is vain and frivolous.</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore to arms! And, father, do but think</LINE>
<LINE>How sweet a thing it is to wear a crown,</LINE>
<LINE>Within whose circuit is Elysium</LINE>
<LINE>And all that poets feign of bliss and joy.</LINE>
<LINE>Why do we linger thus? I cannot rest</LINE>

<LINE>While you are thus employ&#8217;d, what resteth more,</LINE>

<LINE>Brave warriors, Clifford and Northumberland,</LINE>

<LINE>Yet parted but the shadow with his hand.</LINE>
<LINE>What, was it you that would be England&#8217;s king?</LINE>
<LINE>Was&#8217;t you that revell&#8217;d in our parliament,</LINE>
<LINE>And made a preachment of your high descent?</LINE>
<LINE>Where are your mess of sons to back you now,</LINE>
<LINE>The wanton Edward, and the lusty George?</LINE>
<LINE>And where&#8217;s that valiant crook-back prodigy,</LINE>
<LINE>Dicky, your boy, that with his grumbling voice</LINE>
<LINE>Was wont to cheer his dad in mutinies?</LINE>
<LINE>Or with the rest, where is your darling, Rutland?</LINE>
<LINE>Look, York, I stain&#8217;d this napkin with the blood</LINE>
<LINE>That valiant Clifford with his rapier&#8217;s point</LINE>
<LINE>Made issue from the bosom of the boy;</LINE>
<LINE>And if thine eyes can water for his death,</LINE>
<LINE>I give thee this to dry thy cheeks withal.</LINE>
<LINE>Alas, poor York, but that I hate thee deadly,</LINE>
<LINE>I should lament thy miserable state.</LINE>
<LINE>I prithee grieve, to make me merry, York.</LINE>
<LINE>What, hath thy fiery heart so parch&#8217;d thine entrils</LINE>
<LINE>That not a tear can fall for Rutland&#8217;s death?</LINE>
<LINE>Why art thou patient, man? Thou shouldst be mad;</LINE>
<LINE>And I, to make thee mad, do mock thee thus.</LINE>
<LINE>Stamp, rave, and fret, that I may sing and dance.</LINE>
<LINE>Thou wouldst be fee&#8217;d, I see, to make me sport:</LINE>
<LINE>York cannot speak unless he wear a crown.</LINE>
<LINE>A crown for York! And, lords, bow low to him;</LINE>
<LINE>Hold you his hands whilest I do set it on.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Putting a paper crown on his head.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Ay, marry, sir, now looks he like a king!</LINE>
<LINE>Ay, this is he that took King Henry&#8217;s chair,</LINE>
<LINE>And this is he was his adopted heir.</LINE>
<LINE>But how is it that great Plantagenet</LINE>
<LINE>Is crown&#8217;d so soon, and broke his solemn oath?</LINE>
<LINE>As I bethink me, you should not be king</LINE>
<LINE>Till our King Henry had shook hands with death.</LINE>
<LINE>And will you pale your head in Henry&#8217;s glory,</LINE>
<LINE>And rob his temples of the diadem,</LINE>
<LINE>Now in his life, against your holy oath?</LINE>
<LINE>O, &#8217;tis a fault too too unpardonable!</LINE>
<LINE>Off with the crown; and, with the crown, his head,</LINE>
<LINE>And whilest we breathe, take time to do him dead.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She-wolf of France, but worse than wolves of France,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose tongue more poisons than the adder&#8217;s tooth!</LINE>
<LINE>How ill-beseeming is it in thy sex</LINE>
<LINE>To triumph like an Amazonian trull</LINE>
<LINE>Upon their woes whom fortune captivates!</LINE>
<LINE>But that thy face is vizard-like, unchanging,</LINE>
<LINE>Made impudent with use of evil deeds,</LINE>
<LINE>I would assay, proud queen, to make thee blush.</LINE>
<LINE>To tell thee whence thou cam&#8217;st, of whom deriv&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Were shame enough to shame thee, wert thou not shameless.</LINE>
<LINE>Thy father bears the type of King of Naples,</LINE>
<LINE>Of both the Sicils and Jerusalem,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet not so wealthy as an English yeoman.</LINE>
<LINE>Hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult?</LINE>
<LINE>It needs not, nor it boots thee not, proud queen,</LINE>
<LINE>Unless the adage must be verified,</LINE>
<LINE>That beggars mounted run their horse to death.</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis beauty that doth oft make women proud,</LINE>
<LINE>But God he knows thy share thereof is small.</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis virtue that doth make them most admir&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>The contrary doth make thee wond&#8217;red at.</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis government that makes them seem divine,</LINE>
<LINE>The want thereof makes thee abominable.</LINE>
<LINE>Thou art as opposite to every good</LINE>
<LINE>As the antipodes are unto us,</LINE>
<LINE>Or as the south to the septentrion.</LINE>
<LINE>O tiger&#8217;s heart wrapp&#8217;d in a woman&#8217;s hide!</LINE>
<LINE>How couldst thou drain the life-blood of the child,</LINE>
<LINE>To bid the father wipe his eyes withal,</LINE>
<LINE>And yet be seen to wear a woman&#8217;s face?</LINE>
<LINE>Women are soft, mild, pitiful, and flexible;</LINE>
<LINE>Thou stern, obdurate, flinty, rough, remorseless.</LINE>
<LINE>Bid&#8217;st thou me rage? Why, now thou hast thy wish:</LINE>
<LINE>Wouldst have me weep? Why, now thou hast thy will:</LINE>
<LINE>For raging wind blows up incessant showers,</LINE>
<LINE>And when the rage allays, the rain begins.</LINE>
<LINE>These tears are my sweet Rutland&#8217;s obsequies,</LINE>
<LINE>And every drop cries vengeance for his death</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Gainst thee, fell Clifford, and thee, false Frenchwoman.</LINE>

<LINE>But you are more inhuman, more inexorable,</LINE>
<LINE>O, ten times more, than tigers of Hyrcania.</LINE>
<LINE>See, ruthless queen, a hapless father&#8217;s tears!</LINE>
<LINE>This cloth thou dipp&#8217;dst in blood of my sweet boy,</LINE>
<LINE>And I with tears do wash the blood away.</LINE>
<LINE>Keep thou the napkin and go boast of this,</LINE>
<LINE>And if thou tell&#8217;st the heavy story right,</LINE>
<LINE>Upon my soul, the hearers will shed tears;</LINE>
<LINE>Yea, even my foes will shed fast-falling tears,</LINE>
<LINE>And say, &#8220;Alas, it was a piteous deed!&#8221;</LINE>
<LINE>There, take the crown, and with the crown, my curse,</LINE>
<LINE>And in thy need such comfort come to thee</LINE>
<LINE>As now I reap at thy too cruel hand!</LINE>
<LINE>Hard-hearted Clifford, take me from the world,</LINE>
<LINE>My soul to heaven, my blood upon your heads!</LINE>

<LINE>I wonder how our princely father scap&#8217;d;</LINE>

<LINE>From Clifford&#8217;s and Northumberland&#8217;s pursuit.</LINE>
<LINE>Had he been ta&#8217;en, we should have heard the news;</LINE>
<LINE>Had he been slain, we should have heard the news;</LINE>
<LINE>Or had he scap&#8217;d, methinks we should have heard</LINE>
<LINE>The happy tidings of his good escape.</LINE>
<LINE>How fares my brother? Why is he so sad?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I cannot joy, until I be resolv&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>Where our right valiant father is become.</LINE>
<LINE>I saw him in the battle range about,</LINE>
<LINE>And watch&#8217;d him how he singled Clifford forth.</LINE>
<LINE>Methought he bore him in the thickest troop</LINE>
<LINE>As doth a lion in a herd of neat,</LINE>
<LINE>Or as a bear, encompass&#8217;d round with dogs,</LINE>
<LINE>Who having pinch&#8217;d a few and made them cry,</LINE>
<LINE>The rest stand all aloof and bark at him.</LINE>
<LINE>So far&#8217;d our father with his enemies,</LINE>
<LINE>So fled his enemies my warlike father;</LINE>
<LINE>Methinks &#8217;tis prize enough to be his son.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Three suns appear in the air.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>See how the morning opes her golden gates,</LINE>

<LINE>Not separated with the racking clouds,</LINE>
<LINE>But sever&#8217;d in a pale clear-shining sky.</LINE>
<LINE>See, see, they join, embrace, and seem to kiss,</LINE>
<LINE>As if they vow&#8217;d some league inviolable.</LINE>
<LINE>Now are they but one lamp, one light, one sun.</LINE>
<LINE>In this the heaven figures some event.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDW.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis wondrous strange, the like yet never heard of.</LINE>
<LINE>I think it cites us, brother, to the field,</LINE>
<LINE>That we, the sons of brave Plantagenet,</LINE>
<LINE>Each one already blazing by our meeds,</LINE>
<LINE>Should notwithstanding join our lights together,</LINE>
<LINE>And over-shine the earth as this the world.</LINE>
<LINE>What e&#8217;er it bodes, henceforward will I bear</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. NOR. MESS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Environed he was with many foes,</LINE>
<LINE>And stood against them, as the hope of Troy</LINE>
<LINE>Against the Greeks that would have ent&#8217;red Troy.</LINE>
<LINE>But Hercules himself must yield to odds;</LINE>
<LINE>And many strokes, though with a little axe,</LINE>
<LINE>Hews down and fells the hardest-timber&#8217;d oak.</LINE>
<LINE>By many hands your father was subdu&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>But only slaught&#8217;red by the ireful arm</LINE>
<LINE>Of unrelenting Clifford and the Queen;</LINE>
<LINE>Who crown&#8217;d the gracious Duke in high despite,</LINE>
<LINE>Laugh&#8217;d in his face; and when with grief he wept,</LINE>
<LINE>The ruthless Queen gave him to dry his cheeks</LINE>
<LINE>A napkin steeped in the harmless blood</LINE>
<LINE>Of sweet young Rutland, by rough Clifford slain.</LINE>
<LINE>And after many scorns, many foul taunts,</LINE>
<LINE>They took his head, and on the gates of York</LINE>
<LINE>They set the same, and there it doth remain,</LINE>
<LINE>The saddest spectacle that e&#8217;er I view&#8217;d.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDW.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sweet Duke of York, our prop to lean upon,</LINE>
<LINE>Now thou art gone we have no staff, no stay.</LINE>
<LINE>O Clifford, boist&#8217;rous Clifford, thou hast slain</LINE>
<LINE>The flow&#8217;r of Europe for his chevalry,</LINE>
<LINE>And treacherously hast thou vanquish&#8217;d him,</LINE>
<LINE>For hand to hand he would have vanquish&#8217;d thee.</LINE>
<LINE>Now my soul&#8217;s palace is become a prison;</LINE>
<LINE>Ah, would she break from hence, that this my body</LINE>
<LINE>Might in the ground be closed up in rest!</LINE>
<LINE>For never henceforth shall I joy again,</LINE>
<LINE>Never, O never, shall I see more joy!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I cannot weep; for all my body&#8217;s moisture</LINE>
<LINE>Scarce serves to quench my furnace-burning heart;</LINE>
<LINE>Nor can my tongue unload my heart&#8217;s great burden,</LINE>
<LINE>For self-same wind that I should speak withal</LINE>
<LINE>Is kindling coals that fires all my breast,</LINE>
<LINE>And burns me up with flames that tears would quench.</LINE>
<LINE>To weep is to make less the depth of grief:</LINE>
<LINE>Tears then for babes; blows and revenge for me.</LINE>
<LINE>Richard, I bear thy name, I&#8217;ll venge thy death,</LINE>
<LINE>Or die renowned by attempting it.</LINE>

<LINE>Great Lord of Warwick, if we should recompt</LINE>
<LINE>Our baleful news, and at each word&#8217;s deliverance</LINE>
<LINE>Stab poniards in our flesh till all were told,</LINE>
<LINE>The words would add more anguish than the wounds.</LINE>
<LINE>O valiant lord, the Duke of York is slain!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDW.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O Warwick, Warwick, that Plantagenet,</LINE>
<LINE>Which held thee dearly as his soul&#8217;s redemption,</LINE>
<LINE>Is by the stern Lord Clifford done to death.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ten days ago I drown&#8217;d these news in tears;</LINE>
<LINE>And now, to add more measure to your woes,</LINE>
<LINE>I come to tell you things sith then befall&#8217;n.</LINE>
<LINE>After the bloody fray at Wakefield fought,</LINE>
<LINE>Where your brave father breath&#8217;d his latest gasp,</LINE>
<LINE>Tidings, as swiftly as the posts could run,</LINE>
<LINE>Were brought me of your loss and his depart.</LINE>
<LINE>I, then in London, keeper of the King,</LINE>
<LINE>Muster&#8217;d my soldiers, gathered flocks of friends,</LINE>
<LINE>And very well appointed, as I thought,</LINE>
<LINE>March&#8217;d toward Saint Albons to intercept the Queen,</LINE>
<LINE>Bearing the King in my behalf along;</LINE>
<LINE>For by my scouts I was advertised</LINE>
<LINE>That she was coming with a full intent</LINE>
<LINE>To dash our late decree in parliament</LINE>
<LINE>Touching King Henry&#8217;s oath and your succession.</LINE>
<LINE>Short tale to make, we at Saint Albons met,</LINE>
<LINE>Our battles join&#8217;d, and both sides fiercely fought;</LINE>
<LINE>But whether &#8217;twas the coldness of the King,</LINE>
<LINE>Who look&#8217;d full gently on his warlike queen,</LINE>
<LINE>That robb&#8217;d my soldiers of their heated spleen;</LINE>
<LINE>Or whether &#8217;twas report of her success,</LINE>
<LINE>Or more than common fear of Clifford&#8217;s rigor,</LINE>
<LINE>Who thunders to his captives blood and death,</LINE>
<LINE>I cannot judge: but, to conclude with truth,</LINE>
<LINE>Their weapons like to lightning came and went;</LINE>
<LINE>Our soldiers&#8217;, like the night-owl&#8217;s lazy flight,</LINE>
<LINE>Or like an idle thresher with a flail,</LINE>
<LINE>Fell gently down, as if they struck their friends.</LINE>
<LINE>I cheer&#8217;d them up with justice of our cause,</LINE>
<LINE>With promise of high pay and great rewards;</LINE>
<LINE>But all in vain, they had no heart to fight,</LINE>
<LINE>And we, in them, no hope to win the day,</LINE>
<LINE>So that we fled: the King unto the Queen;</LINE>
<LINE>Lord George your brother, Norfolk, and myself,</LINE>
<LINE>In haste, post-haste, are come to join with you;</LINE>
<LINE>For in the marches here we heard you were,</LINE>
<LINE>Making another head to fight again.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDW.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Where is the Duke of Norfolk, gentle Warwick?</LINE>
<LINE>And when came George from Burgundy to England?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Some six miles off the Duke is with the soldiers,</LINE>
<LINE>And for your brother, he was lately sent</LINE>
<LINE>From your kind aunt, Duchess of Burgundy,</LINE>
<LINE>With aid of soldiers to this needful war.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;Twas odds, belike, when valiant Warwick fled:</LINE>
<LINE>Oft have I heard his praises in pursuit,</LINE>
<LINE>But ne&#8217;er till now his scandal of retire.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nor now my scandal, Richard, dost thou hear;</LINE>
<LINE>For thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine</LINE>
<LINE>Can pluck the diadem from faint Henry&#8217;s head,</LINE>
<LINE>And wring the aweful sceptre from his fist,</LINE>
<LINE>Were he as famous and as bold in war</LINE>
<LINE>As he is fam&#8217;d for mildness, peace, and prayer.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know it well, Lord Warwick, blame me not.</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis love I bear thy glories make me speak.</LINE>
<LINE>But in this troublous time what&#8217;s to be done?</LINE>
<LINE>Shall we go throw away our coats of steel,</LINE>
<LINE>And wrap our bodies in black mourning gowns,</LINE>
<LINE>Numb&#8217;ring our Ave-Maries with our beads?</LINE>
<LINE>Or shall we on the helmets of our foes</LINE>
<LINE>Tell our devotion with revengeful arms?</LINE>
<LINE>If for the last, say ay, and to it, lords.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, therefore Warwick came to seek you out,</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore comes my brother Montague.</LINE>
<LINE>Attend me, lords: the proud insulting Queen,</LINE>
<LINE>With Clifford and the haught Northumberland,</LINE>
<LINE>And of their feather many more proud birds,</LINE>
<LINE>Have wrought the easy-melting King like wax.</LINE>
<LINE>He swore consent to your succession,</LINE>
<LINE>His oath enrolled in the parliament;</LINE>
<LINE>And now to London all the crew are gone</LINE>
<LINE>To frustrate both his oath and what beside</LINE>
<LINE>May make against the house of Lancaster.</LINE>
<LINE>Their power, I think, is thirty thousand strong.</LINE>
<LINE>Now, if the help of Norfolk and myself,</LINE>
<LINE>With all the friends that thou, brave Earl of March,</LINE>
<LINE>Amongst the loving Welshmen canst procure,</LINE>
<LINE>Will but amount to five and twenty thousand,</LINE>
<LINE>Why, via! To London will we march,</LINE>
<LINE>And once again bestride our foaming steeds,</LINE>
<LINE>And once again cry &#8220;Charge!&#8221; upon our foes,</LINE>
<LINE>But never once again turn back and fly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, now methinks I hear great Warwick speak.</LINE>
<LINE>Ne&#8217;er may he live to see a sunshine day</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDW.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Lord Warwick, on thy shoulder will I lean,</LINE>
<LINE>And when thou fail&#8217;st (as God forbid the hour!)</LINE>
<LINE>Must Edward fall, which peril heaven forefend!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No longer Earl of March, but Duke of York;</LINE>
<LINE>The next degree is England&#8217;s royal throne;</LINE>

<LINE>Whose hand is that the forest bear doth lick?</LINE>
<LINE>Not his that spoils her young before her face.</LINE>
<LINE>Who scapes the lurking serpent&#8217;s mortal sting?</LINE>
<LINE>Not he that sets his foot upon her back.</LINE>
<LINE>The smallest worm will turn, being trodden on,</LINE>
<LINE>And doves will peck in safeguard of their brood.</LINE>
<LINE>Ambitious York did level at thy crown,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou smiling while he knit his angry brows:</LINE>
<LINE>He, but a duke, would have his son a king,</LINE>
<LINE>And raise his issue like a loving sire;</LINE>
<LINE>Thou, being a king, blest with a goodly son,</LINE>
<LINE>Didst yield consent to disinherit him,</LINE>
<LINE>Which argued thee a most unloving father.</LINE>
<LINE>Unreasonable creatures feed their young,</LINE>
<LINE>And though man&#8217;s face be fearful to their eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet in protection of their tender ones,</LINE>
<LINE>Who hath not seen them, even with those wings</LINE>
<LINE>Which sometime they have us&#8217;d with fearful flight,</LINE>
<LINE>Make war with him that climb&#8217;d unto their nest,</LINE>
<LINE>Offering their own lives in their young&#8217;s defense?</LINE>
<LINE>For shame, my liege, make them your president!</LINE>
<LINE>Were it not pity that this goodly boy</LINE>
<LINE>Should lose his birthright by his father&#8217;s fault,</LINE>
<LINE>And long hereafter say unto his child,</LINE>
<LINE>&#8220;What my great-grandfather and grandsire got,</LINE>
<LINE>My careless father fondly gave away&#8221;?</LINE>
<LINE>Ah, what a shame were this! Look on the boy,</LINE>

<LINE>And happy always was it for that son</LINE>
<LINE>Whose father for his hoarding went to hell?</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll leave my son my virtuous deeds behind,</LINE>
<LINE>And would my father had left me no more!</LINE>
<LINE>For all the rest is held at such a rate</LINE>

<LINE>Go rate thy minions, proud insulting boy!</LINE>
<LINE>Becomes it thee to be thus bold in terms</LINE>
<LINE>Before thy sovereign and thy lawful king?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDW.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am his king, and he should bow his knee.</LINE>
<LINE>I was adopted heir by his consent.</LINE>
<LINE>Since when, his oath is broke; for, as I hear,</LINE>
<LINE>You that are king, though he do wear the crown,</LINE>
<LINE>Have caus&#8217;d him, by new act of parliament,</LINE>
<LINE>To blot out me, and put his own son in.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>And reason too:</LINE>

<LINE>Why, how now, long-tongu&#8217;d Warwick, dare you speak?</LINE>
<LINE>When you and I met at Saint Albons last,</LINE>
<LINE>Your legs did better service than your hands.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then &#8217;twas my turn to fly, and now &#8217;tis thine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLIF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You said so much before, and yet you fled.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;Twas not your valor, Clifford, drove me thence.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NORTH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, nor your manhood that durst make you stay.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Northumberland, I hold thee reverently.</LINE>
<LINE>Break off the parley, for scarce I can refrain</LINE>
<LINE>The execution of my big-swoll&#8217;n heart</LINE>
<LINE>Upon that Clifford, that cruel child-killer.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLIF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I slew thy father, call&#8217;st thou him a child?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, like a dastard and a treacherous coward,</LINE>
<LINE>As thou didst kill our tender brother Rutland,</LINE>
<LINE>But ere sunset I&#8217;ll make thee curse the deed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. HEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Have done with words, my lords, and hear me speak.</LINE>

<LINE>Defy them then, or else hold close thy lips.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. HEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I prithee give no limits to my tongue,</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLIF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My liege, the wound that bred this meeting here</LINE>
<LINE>Cannot be cur&#8217;d by words; therefore be still.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then, executioner, unsheathe thy sword.</LINE>
<LINE>By Him that made us all, I am resolv&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>That Clifford&#8217;s manhood lies upon his tongue.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDW.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Say, Henry, shall I have my right, or no?</LINE>
<LINE>A thousand men have broke their fasts today</LINE>
<LINE>That ne&#8217;er shall dine unless thou yield the crown.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If thou deny, their blood upon thy head,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If that be right which Warwick says is right,</LINE>
<LINE>There is no wrong, but every thing is right.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Whoever got thee, there thy mother stands,</LINE>
<LINE>For well I wot, thou hast thy mother&#8217;s tongue.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Q. MAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But thou art neither like thy sire nor dam,</LINE>
<LINE>But like a foul misshapen stigmatic,</LINE>
<LINE>Mark&#8217;d by the destinies to be avoided,</LINE>
<LINE>As venom toads, or lizards&#8217; dreadful stings.</LINE>

<LINE>(As if a channel should be call&#8217;d the sea),</LINE>
<LINE>Sham&#8217;st thou not, knowing whence thou art extraught,</LINE>
<LINE>To let thy tongue detect thy base-born heart?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDW.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns</LINE>
<LINE>To make this shameless callet know herself.</LINE>
<LINE>Helen of Greece was fairer far than thou,</LINE>
<LINE>Although thy husband may be Menelaus;</LINE>
<LINE>And ne&#8217;er was Agamemnon&#8217;s brother wrong&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>By that false woman as this king by thee.</LINE>
<LINE>His father revell&#8217;d in the heart of France,</LINE>
<LINE>And tam&#8217;d the King and made the Dauphin stoop;</LINE>
<LINE>And had he match&#8217;d according to his state,</LINE>
<LINE>He might have kept that glory to this day.</LINE>
<LINE>But when he took a beggar to his bed,</LINE>
<LINE>And grac&#8217;d thy poor sire with his bridal day,</LINE>
<LINE>Even then that sunshine brew&#8217;d a show&#8217;r for him,</LINE>
<LINE>That wash&#8217;d his father&#8217;s fortunes forth of France,</LINE>
<LINE>And heap&#8217;d sedition on his crown at home.</LINE>
<LINE>For what hath broach&#8217;d this tumult but thy pride?</LINE>
<LINE>Hadst thou been meek, our title still had slept,</LINE>
<LINE>And we, in pity of the gentle king,</LINE>
<LINE>Had slipp&#8217;d our claim until another age.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GEO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But when we saw our sunshine made thy spring,</LINE>
<LINE>And that thy summer bred us no increase,</LINE>
<LINE>We set the axe to thy usurping root;</LINE>
<LINE>And though the edge hath something hit ourselves,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet know thou, since we have begun to strike,</LINE>
<LINE>We&#8217;ll never leave till we have hewn thee down,</LINE>
<LINE>Or bath&#8217;d thy growing with our heated bloods.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDW.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And in this resolution, I defy thee,</LINE>
<LINE>Not willing any longer conference,</LINE>
<LINE>Since thou deniedst the gentle king to speak.</LINE>
<LINE>Sound trumpets! Let our bloody colors wave!</LINE>
<LINE>And either victory, or else a grave.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Q. MAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Stay, Edward.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDW.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, wrangling woman, we&#8217;ll no longer stay,</LINE>

<LINE>Ah, Warwick, why hast thou withdrawn thyself?</LINE>
<LINE>Thy brother&#8217;s blood the thirsty earth hath drunk,</LINE>
<LINE>Broach&#8217;d with the steely point of Clifford&#8217;s lance;</LINE>
<LINE>And in the very pangs of death he cried,</LINE>
<LINE>Like to a dismal clangor heard from far,</LINE>
<LINE>&#8220;Warwick, revenge! Brother, revenge my death!&#8221;</LINE>
<LINE>So underneath the belly of their steeds,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then let the earth be drunken with our blood!</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll kill my horse, because I will not fly.</LINE>

<LINE>Now sways it this way, like a mighty sea</LINE>
<LINE>Forc&#8217;d by the tide to combat with the wind;</LINE>
<LINE>Now sways it that way, like the self-same sea</LINE>
<LINE>Forc&#8217;d to retire by fury of the wind.</LINE>
<LINE>Sometime the flood prevails, and then the wind;</LINE>
<LINE>Now one the better, then another best;</LINE>
<LINE>Both tugging to be victors, breast to breast,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet neither conqueror nor conquered;</LINE>
<LINE>So is the equal poise of this fell war.</LINE>
<LINE>Here on this molehill will I sit me down.</LINE>
<LINE>To whom God will, there be the victory!</LINE>
<LINE>For Margaret my queen, and Clifford too,</LINE>
<LINE>Have chid me from the battle; swearing both</LINE>
<LINE>They prosper best of all when I am thence.</LINE>
<LINE>Would I were dead, if God&#8217;s good will were so;</LINE>
<LINE>For what is in this world but grief and woe?</LINE>
<LINE>O God! Methinks it were a happy life</LINE>
<LINE>To be no better than a homely swain,</LINE>
<LINE>To sit upon a hill, as I do now,</LINE>
<LINE>To carve out dials quaintly, point by point,</LINE>
<LINE>Thereby to see the minutes how they run:</LINE>
<LINE>How many makes the hour full complete,</LINE>
<LINE>How many hours brings about the day,</LINE>
<LINE>How many days will finish up the year,</LINE>
<LINE>How many years a mortal man may live.</LINE>
<LINE>When this is known, then to divide the times:</LINE>
<LINE>So many hours must I tend my flock,</LINE>
<LINE>So many hours must I take my rest,</LINE>
<LINE>So many hours must I contemplate,</LINE>
<LINE>So many hours must I sport myself,</LINE>
<LINE>So many days my ewes have been with young,</LINE>
<LINE>So many weeks ere the poor fools will ean,</LINE>
<LINE>So many years ere I shall shear the fleece:</LINE>
<LINE>So minutes, hours, days, months, and years,</LINE>
<LINE>Pass&#8217;d over to the end they were created,</LINE>
<LINE>Would bring white hairs unto a quiet grave.</LINE>
<LINE>Ah! What a life were this! How sweet! How lovely!</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>A loud alarum. Enter Clifford wounded with an arrow in his neck.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLIF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here burns my candle out; ay, here it dies,</LINE>
<LINE>Which whiles it lasted, gave King Henry light.</LINE>
<LINE>O Lancaster! I fear thy overthrow</LINE>
<LINE>More than my body&#8217;s parting with my soul.</LINE>
<LINE>My love and fear glu&#8217;d many friends to thee,</LINE>
<LINE>And now I fall, thy tough commixtures melts,</LINE>
<LINE>Impairing Henry, strength&#8217;ning misproud York.</LINE>
<LINE>The common people swarm like summer flies,</LINE>
<LINE>And whither fly the gnats but to the sun?</LINE>
<LINE>And who shines now but Henry&#8217;s enemies?</LINE>
<LINE>O Phoebus! Hadst thou never given consent</LINE>
<LINE>That Pha&#235;ton should check thy fiery steeds,</LINE>
<LINE>Thy burning car never had scorch&#8217;d the earth.</LINE>
<LINE>And, Henry, hadst thou sway&#8217;d as kings should do,</LINE>
<LINE>Or as thy father and his father did,</LINE>
<LINE>Giving no ground unto the house of York,</LINE>
<LINE>They never then had sprung like summer flies;</LINE>
<LINE>I and ten thousand in this luckless realm</LINE>
<LINE>Had left no mourning widows for our death,</LINE>
<LINE>And thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace.</LINE>
<LINE>For what doth cherish weeds but gentle air?</LINE>
<LINE>And what makes robbers bold but too much lenity?</LINE>
<LINE>Bootless are plaints, and cureless are my wounds;</LINE>
<LINE>No way to fly, nor strength to hold out flight.</LINE>
<LINE>The foe is merciless, and will not pity;</LINE>
<LINE>For at their hands I have deserv&#8217;d no pity.</LINE>
<LINE>The air hath got into my deadly wounds,</LINE>
<LINE>And much effuse of blood doth make me faint.</LINE>
<LINE>Come, York and Richard, Warwick and the rest,</LINE>
<LINE>I stabb&#8217;d your fathers&#8217; bosoms, split my breast.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>He faints.</STAGEDIR>

<STAGEDIR>Alarum and retreat. Enter Edward, Warwick, Richard, and Soldiers, Montague, and George of Clarence.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDW.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now breathe we, lords, good fortune bids us pause</LINE>
<LINE>And smooth the frowns of war with peaceful looks.</LINE>
<LINE>Some troops pursue the bloody-minded queen,</LINE>
<LINE>That led calm Henry, though he were a king,</LINE>
<LINE>As doth a sail, fill&#8217;d with a fretting gust,</LINE>
<LINE>Command an argosy to stem the waves.</LINE>
<LINE>But think you, lords, that Clifford fled with them?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, &#8217;tis impossible he should escape;</LINE>
<LINE>For (though before his face I speak the words)</LINE>
<LINE>Your brother Richard mark&#8217;d him for the grave,</LINE>
<LINE>And wheresoe&#8217;er he is, he&#8217;s surely dead.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Clifford groans and then dies.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Whose soul is that which takes her heavy leave?</LINE>
<LINE>A deadly groan, like life and death&#8217;s departing.</LINE>
<LINE>See who it is.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDW.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And, now the battle&#8217;s ended,</LINE>
<LINE>If friend or foe, let him be gently used.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Revoke that doom of mercy, for &#8217;tis Clifford,</LINE>
<LINE>Who, not contented that he lopp&#8217;d the branch</LINE>
<LINE>In hewing Rutland when his leaves put forth,</LINE>
<LINE>But set his murth&#8217;ring knife unto the root</LINE>
<LINE>From whence that tender spray did sweetly spring,</LINE>
<LINE>I mean our princely father, Duke of York.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>From off the gates of York fetch down the head,</LINE>
<LINE>Your father&#8217;s head, which Clifford placed there;</LINE>
<LINE>In stead whereof let this supply the room:</LINE>
<LINE>Measure for measure must be answered.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDW.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Bring forth that fatal screech owl to our house</LINE>
<LINE>That nothing sung but death to us and ours.</LINE>
<LINE>Now death shall stop his dismal threat&#8217;ning sound,</LINE>
<LINE>And his ill-boding tongue no more shall speak.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I think his understanding is bereft.</LINE>
<LINE>Speak, Clifford, dost thou know who speaks to thee?</LINE>
<LINE>Dark cloudy death o&#8217;ershades his beams of life,</LINE>
<LINE>And he nor sees nor hears us what we say.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O would he did! And so, perhaps, he doth;</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis but his policy to counterfeit,</LINE>
<LINE>Because he would avoid such bitter taunts</LINE>
<LINE>Which in the time of death he gave our father.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GEO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If so thou think&#8217;st, vex him with eager words.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Clifford, ask mercy and obtain no grace.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDW.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Clifford, repent in bootless penitence.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Clifford, devise excuses for thy faults.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GEO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>While we devise fell tortures for thy faults.</LINE>

<LINE>Thou pitiedst Rutland, I will pity thee.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>They mock thee, Clifford, swear as thou wast wont.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, not an oath? Nay, then the world goes hard</LINE>
<LINE>When Clifford cannot spare his friends an oath.</LINE>
<LINE>I know by that he&#8217;s dead, and by my soul,</LINE>
<LINE>If this right hand would buy two hours&#8217; life</LINE>
<LINE>That I, in all despite, might rail at him,</LINE>
<LINE>This hand should chop it off; and with the issuing blood</LINE>
<LINE>Stifle the villain whose unstanched thirst</LINE>
<LINE>York and young Rutland could not satisfy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, but he&#8217;s dead. Off with the traitor&#8217;s head,</LINE>
<LINE>And rear it in the place your father&#8217;s stands.</LINE>
<LINE>And now to London with triumphant march,</LINE>
<LINE>There to be crowned England&#8217;s royal king;</LINE>
<LINE>From whence shall Warwick cut the sea to France,</LINE>
<LINE>And ask the Lady Bona for thy queen.</LINE>
<LINE>So shalt thou sinow both these lands together,</LINE>
<LINE>And having France thy friend, thou shalt not dread</LINE>
<LINE>The scatt&#8217;red foe that hopes to rise again;</LINE>
<LINE>For though they cannot greatly sting to hurt,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet look to have them buzz to offend thine ears.</LINE>
<LINE>First will I see the coronation,</LINE>
<LINE>And then to Brittany I&#8217;ll cross the sea</LINE>
<LINE>To effect this marriage, so it please my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDW.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Even as thou wilt, sweet Warwick, let it be;</LINE>
<LINE>For in thy shoulder do I build my seat,</LINE>
<LINE>And never will I undertake the thing</LINE>
<LINE>Wherein thy counsel and consent is wanting.</LINE>
<LINE>Richard, I will create thee Duke of Gloucester,</LINE>
<LINE>And George, of Clarence. Warwick, as ourself,</LINE>
<LINE>Shall do and undo as him pleaseth best.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RICH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let me be Duke of Clarence, George of Gloucester,</LINE>
<LINE>For Gloucester&#8217;s dukedom is too ominous.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tut, that&#8217;s a foolish observation.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>K. HEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>From Scotland am I stol&#8217;n, even of pure love,</LINE>

<SPEAKER>K. HEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My queen and son are gone to France for aid;</LINE>
<LINE>And, as I hear, the great commanding Warwick</LINE>
<LINE>Is thither gone to crave the French king&#8217;s sister</LINE>
<LINE>To wife for Edward. If this news be true,</LINE>
<LINE>Poor queen and son, your labor is but lost;</LINE>
<LINE>For Warwick is a subtle orator,</LINE>
<LINE>And Lewis a prince soon won with moving words.</LINE>
<LINE>By this account then, Margaret may win him,</LINE>
<LINE>For she&#8217;s a woman to be pitied much.</LINE>
<LINE>Her sighs will make a batt&#8217;ry in his breast,</LINE>
<LINE>Her tears will pierce into a marble heart;</LINE>
<LINE>The tiger will be mild whiles she doth mourn;</LINE>
<LINE>And Nero will be tainted with remorse</LINE>
<LINE>To hear and see her plaints, her brinish tears.</LINE>
<LINE>Ay, but she&#8217;s come to beg; Warwick, to give:</LINE>
<LINE>She, on his left side, craving aid for Henry;</LINE>
<LINE>He, on his right, asking a wife for Edward.</LINE>
<LINE>She weeps, and says her Henry is depos&#8217;d;</LINE>
<LINE>He smiles, and says his Edward is install&#8217;d;</LINE>
<LINE>That she, poor wretch, for grief can speak no more;</LINE>
<LINE>Whiles Warwick tells his title, smooths the wrong,</LINE>
<LINE>Inferreth arguments of mighty strength,</LINE>
<LINE>And in conclusion wins the King from her</LINE>
<LINE>With promise of his sister and what else,</LINE>
<LINE>To strengthen and support King Edward&#8217;s place.</LINE>
<LINE>O Margaret, thus &#8217;twill be, and thou, poor soul,</LINE>
<LINE>Art then forsaken, as thou went&#8217;st forlorn!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. KEEP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Say, what art thou talk&#8217;st of kings and queens?</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. HEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>More than I seem, and less than I was born to;</LINE>
<LINE>A man at least, for less I should not be;</LINE>
<LINE>And men may talk of kings, and why not I?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. KEEP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, but thou talk&#8217;st as if thou wert a king.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. HEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, so I am&#8212;in mind, and that&#8217;s enough.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>2. KEEP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But if thou be a king, where is thy crown?</LINE>

<SPEAKER>K. HEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My crown is in my heart, not on my head;</LINE>
<LINE>Not deck&#8217;d with diamonds and Indian stones,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor to be seen. My crown is call&#8217;d content,</LINE>
<LINE>A crown it is that seldom kings enjoy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. KEEP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, if you be a king crown&#8217;d with content,</LINE>
<LINE>Your crown content and you must be contented</LINE>
<LINE>To go along with us; for, as we think,</LINE>
<LINE>You are the king King Edward hath depos&#8217;d;</LINE>
<LINE>And we his subjects, sworn in all allegiance,</LINE>
<LINE>Will apprehend you as his enemy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. HEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But did you never swear and break an oath?</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. KEEP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, never such an oath, nor will not now.</LINE>

<LINE>And tell me then, have you not broke your oaths?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. KEEP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No,</LINE>
<LINE>For we were subjects but while you were king.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. HEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why? Am I dead? Do I not breathe a man?</LINE>
<LINE>Ah, simple men, you know not what you swear!</LINE>
<LINE>Look, as I blow this feather from my face,</LINE>
<LINE>And as the air blows it to me again,</LINE>
<LINE>Obeying with my wind when I do blow,</LINE>
<LINE>And yielding to another when it blows,</LINE>
<LINE>Commanded always by the greater gust,</LINE>
<LINE>Such is the lightness of you common men.</LINE>
<LINE>But do not break your oaths, for of that sin</LINE>
<LINE>My mild entreaty shall not make you guilty.</LINE>
<LINE>Go where you will, the King shall be commanded;</LINE>
<LINE>And be you kings: command, and I&#8217;ll obey.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>1. KEEP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We are true subjects to the King, King Edward.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>1. KEEP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We charge you, in God&#8217;s name and the King&#8217;s,</LINE>

<LINE>Ay, Edward will use women honorably.</LINE>
<LINE>Would he were wasted, marrow, bones, and all,</LINE>
<LINE>That from his loins no hopeful branch may spring,</LINE>
<LINE>To cross me from the golden time I look for!</LINE>
<LINE>And yet, between my soul&#8217;s desire and me&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>The lustful Edward&#8217;s title buried&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Is Clarence, Henry, and his son young Edward,</LINE>
<LINE>And all the unlook&#8217;d-for issue of their bodies</LINE>
<LINE>To take their rooms, ere I can place myself:</LINE>
<LINE>A cold premeditation for my purpose!</LINE>
<LINE>Why then I do but dream on sovereignty,</LINE>
<LINE>Like one that stands upon a promontory</LINE>
<LINE>And spies a far-off shore where he would tread,</LINE>
<LINE>Wishing his foot were equal with his eye,</LINE>
<LINE>And chides the sea that sunders him from thence,</LINE>
<LINE>Saying, he&#8217;ll lade it dry to have his way:</LINE>
<LINE>So do I wish the crown, being so far off,</LINE>
<LINE>And so I chide the means that keeps me from it,</LINE>
<LINE>And so, I say, I&#8217;ll cut the causes off,</LINE>
<LINE>Flattering me with impossibilities.</LINE>
<LINE>My eye&#8217;s too quick, my heart o&#8217;erweens too much,</LINE>
<LINE>Unless my hand and strength could equal them.</LINE>
<LINE>Well, say there is no kingdom then for Richard;</LINE>
<LINE>What other pleasure can the world afford?</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll make my heaven in a lady&#8217;s lap,</LINE>
<LINE>And deck my body in gay ornaments,</LINE>
<LINE>And witch sweet ladies with my words and looks.</LINE>
<LINE>O miserable thought! And more unlikely</LINE>
<LINE>Than to accomplish twenty golden crowns!</LINE>
<LINE>Why, love forswore me in my mother&#8217;s womb;</LINE>
<LINE>And for I should not deal in her soft laws,</LINE>
<LINE>She did corrupt frail nature with some bribe,</LINE>
<LINE>To shrink mine arm up like a wither&#8217;d shrub,</LINE>
<LINE>To make an envious mountain on my back,</LINE>
<LINE>Where sits deformity to mock my body;</LINE>
<LINE>To shape my legs of an unequal size,</LINE>
<LINE>To disproportion me in every part,</LINE>
<LINE>Like to a chaos, or an unlick&#8217;d bear-whelp</LINE>
<LINE>That carries no impression like the dam.</LINE>
<LINE>And am I then a man to be belov&#8217;d?</LINE>
<LINE>O monstrous fault, to harbor such a thought!</LINE>
<LINE>Then since this earth affords no joy to me</LINE>
<LINE>But to command, to check, to o&#8217;erbear such</LINE>
<LINE>As are of better person than myself,</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll make my heaven to dream upon the crown,</LINE>
<LINE>And whiles I live, t&#8217; account this world but hell,</LINE>
<LINE>Until my misshap&#8217;d trunk that bears this head</LINE>
<LINE>Be round impaled with a glorious crown.</LINE>
<LINE>And yet I know not how to get the crown,</LINE>
<LINE>For many lives stand between me and home;</LINE>
<LINE>And I&#8212;like one lost in a thorny wood,</LINE>
<LINE>That rents the thorns, and is rent with the thorns,</LINE>
<LINE>Seeking a way, and straying from the way,</LINE>
<LINE>Not knowing how to find the open air,</LINE>
<LINE>But toiling desperately to find it out&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Torment myself to catch the English crown;</LINE>
<LINE>And from that torment I will free myself,</LINE>
<LINE>Or hew my way out with a bloody axe.</LINE>
<LINE>Why, I can smile, and murder whiles I smile,</LINE>
<LINE>And cry &#8220;Content&#8221; to that which grieves my heart,</LINE>
<LINE>And wet my cheeks with artificial tears,</LINE>
<LINE>And frame my face to all occasions.</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll drown more sailors than the mermaid shall,</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll slay more gazers than the basilisk,</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll play the orator as well as Nestor,</LINE>
<LINE>Deceive more slily than Ulysses could,</LINE>
<LINE>And like a Sinon, take another Troy.</LINE>
<LINE>I can add colors to the chameleon,</LINE>
<LINE>Change shapes with Proteus for advantages,</LINE>
<LINE>And set the murderous Machevil to school.</LINE>
<LINE>Can I do this, and cannot get a crown?</LINE>
<LINE>Tut, were it farther off, I&#8217;ll pluck it down.</LINE>

<LINE>Fair Queen of England, worthy Margaret,</LINE>
<LINE>Sit down with us. It ill befits thy state</LINE>
<LINE>And birth that thou shouldst stand while Lewis doth sit.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Q. MAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, mighty King of France; now Margaret</LINE>
<LINE>Must strike her sail and learn a while to serve</LINE>
<LINE>Where kings command. I was, I must confess,</LINE>
<LINE>Great Albion&#8217;s queen in former golden days;</LINE>
<LINE>But now mischance hath trod my title down,</LINE>
<LINE>And with dishonor laid me on the ground,</LINE>
<LINE>Where I must take like seat unto my fortune,</LINE>
<LINE>And to my humble seat conform myself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. LEW.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, say, fair queen, whence springs this deep despair?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Q. MAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>From such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears</LINE>
<LINE>And stops my tongue, while heart is drown&#8217;d in cares.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. LEW.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What e&#8217;er it be, be thou still like thyself,</LINE>
<LINE>And sit thee by our side.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Seats her by him.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE offset="5">Yield not thy neck</LINE>
<LINE>To fortune&#8217;s yoke, but let thy dauntless mind</LINE>
<LINE>Still ride in triumph over all mischance.</LINE>
<LINE>Be plain, Queen Margaret, and tell thy grief;</LINE>
<LINE>It shall be eas&#8217;d if France can yield relief.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Q. MAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Those gracious words revive my drooping thoughts</LINE>
<LINE>And give my tongue-tied sorrows leave to speak.</LINE>
<LINE>Now therefore be it known to noble Lewis,</LINE>
<LINE>That Henry, sole possessor of my love,</LINE>
<LINE>Is, of a king, become a banish&#8217;d man,</LINE>
<LINE>And forc&#8217;d to live in Scotland a forlorn;</LINE>
<LINE>While proud ambitious Edward, Duke of York,</LINE>
<LINE>Usurps the regal title and the seat</LINE>
<LINE>Of England&#8217;s true-anointed lawful king.</LINE>
<LINE>This is the cause that I, poor Margaret,</LINE>
<LINE>With this my son, Prince Edward, Henry&#8217;s heir,</LINE>
<LINE>Am come to crave thy just and lawful aid;</LINE>
<LINE>And if thou fail us, all our hope is done.</LINE>
<LINE>Scotland hath will to help, but cannot help;</LINE>
<LINE>Our people and our peers are both misled,</LINE>
<LINE>Our treasure seiz&#8217;d, our soldiers put to flight,</LINE>
<LINE>And as thou seest, ourselves in heavy plight.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. LEW.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Renowned queen, with patience calm the storm,</LINE>
<LINE>While we bethink a means to break it off.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Q. MAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Our Earl of Warwick, Edward&#8217;s greatest friend.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. LEW.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Welcome, brave Warwick! What brings thee to France?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>He descends. She ariseth.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Q. MAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, now begins a second storm to rise,</LINE>
<LINE>For this is he that moves both wind and tide.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>From worthy Edward, King of Albion,</LINE>
<LINE>My lord and sovereign and thy vowed friend,</LINE>
<LINE>I come, in kindness and unfeigned love,</LINE>
<LINE>First, to do greetings to thy royal person,</LINE>
<LINE>And then to crave a league of amity,</LINE>
<LINE>And lastly, to confirm that amity</LINE>
<LINE>With nuptial knot, if thou vouchsafe to grant</LINE>
<LINE>That virtuous Lady Bona, thy fair sister,</LINE>
<LINE>To England&#8217;s king in lawful marriage.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Q. MAR.</SPEAKER>
<STAGEDIR>Aside.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>If that go forward, Henry&#8217;s hope is done.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And, gracious madam</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Speaking to Lady Bona.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE offset="5">in our king&#8217;s behalf</LINE>
<LINE>I am commanded, with your leave and favor,</LINE>
<LINE>Humbly to kiss your hand, and with my tongue</LINE>
<LINE>To tell the passion of my sovereign&#8217;s heart,</LINE>
<LINE>Where fame, late ent&#8217;ring at his heedful ears,</LINE>
<LINE>Hath plac&#8217;d thy beauty&#8217;s image and thy virtue.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Q. MAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>King Lewis and Lady Bona, hear me speak</LINE>
<LINE>Before you answer Warwick. His demand</LINE>
<LINE>Springs not from Edward&#8217;s well-meant honest love,</LINE>
<LINE>But from deceit bred by necessity;</LINE>
<LINE>For how can tyrants safely govern home,</LINE>
<LINE>Unless abroad they purchase great alliance?</LINE>
<LINE>To prove him tyrant this reason may suffice,</LINE>
<LINE>That Henry liveth still; but were he dead,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet here Prince Edward stands, King Henry&#8217;s son.</LINE>
<LINE>Look therefore, Lewis, that by this league and marriage</LINE>
<LINE>Thou draw not on thy danger and dishonor;</LINE>
<LINE>For though usurpers sway the rule a while,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet heav&#8217;ns are just, and time suppresseth wrongs.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Injurious Margaret!</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">And why not Queen?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Because thy father Henry did usurp,</LINE>
<LINE>And thou no more art prince than she is queen.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OXF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then Warwick disannuls great John of Gaunt,</LINE>
<LINE>Which did subdue the greatest part of Spain;</LINE>
<LINE>And after John of Gaunt, Henry the Fourth,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest;</LINE>
<LINE>And after that wise prince, Henry the Fifth,</LINE>
<LINE>Who by his prowess conquered all France:</LINE>
<LINE>From these our Henry lineally descends.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Oxford, how haps it in this smooth discourse</LINE>
<LINE>You told not how Henry the Sixth hath lost</LINE>
<LINE>All that which Henry the Fifth had gotten?</LINE>
<LINE>Methinks these peers of France should smile at that.</LINE>
<LINE>But for the rest: you tell a pedigree</LINE>
<LINE>Of threescore and two years&#8212;a silly time</LINE>
<LINE>To make prescription for a kingdom&#8217;s worth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OXF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, Warwick, canst thou speak against thy liege,</LINE>
<LINE>Whom thou obey&#8217;dst thirty and six years,</LINE>
<LINE>And not bewray thy treason with a blush?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Can Oxford, that did ever fence the right,</LINE>
<LINE>Now buckler falsehood with a pedigree?</LINE>
<LINE>For shame, leave Henry, and call Edward king.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OXF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Call him my king by whose injurious doom</LINE>
<LINE>My elder brother, the Lord Aubrey Vere,</LINE>
<LINE>Was done to death? And more than so, my father,</LINE>
<LINE>Even in the downfall of his mellow&#8217;d years,</LINE>
<LINE>When nature brought him to the door of death?</LINE>
<LINE>No, Warwick, no; while life upholds this arm,</LINE>
<LINE>This arm upholds the house of Lancaster.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And I the house of York.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. LEW.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Queen Margaret, Prince Edward, and Oxford,</LINE>
<LINE>Vouchsafe, at our request, to stand aside,</LINE>
<LINE>While I use further conference with Warwick.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>They stand aloof.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Q. MAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Heavens grant that Warwick&#8217;s words bewitch him not!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. LEW.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, Warwick, tell me, even upon thy conscience,</LINE>
<LINE>Is Edward your true king? For I were loath</LINE>
<LINE>To link with him that were not lawful chosen.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thereon I pawn my credit and mine honor.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. LEW.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But is he gracious in the people&#8217;s eye?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The more that Henry was unfortunate.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. LEW.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then further: all dissembling set aside,</LINE>
<LINE>Tell me for truth the measure of his love</LINE>
<LINE>Unto our sister Bona.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Such it seems</LINE>
<LINE>As may beseem a monarch like himself.</LINE>
<LINE>Myself have often heard him say, and swear,</LINE>
<LINE>That this his love was an eternal plant,</LINE>
<LINE>Whereof the root was fix&#8217;d in virtue&#8217;s ground,</LINE>
<LINE>The leaves and fruit maintain&#8217;d with beauty&#8217;s sun,</LINE>
<LINE>Exempt from envy, but not from disdain,</LINE>
<LINE>Unless the Lady Bona quit his pain.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. LEW.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, sister, let us hear your firm resolve.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BONA.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your grant, or your denial, shall be mine.</LINE>
<LINE>Yet I confess that often ere this day,</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Speaks to Warwick.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>When I have heard your king&#8217;s desert recounted,</LINE>
<LINE>Mine ear hath tempted judgment to desire.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. LEW.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then, Warwick, thus: our sister shall be Edward&#8217;s.</LINE>

<LINE>Touching the jointure that your king must make,</LINE>
<LINE>Which with her dowry shall be counterpois&#8217;d.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Q. MAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Deceitful Warwick, it was thy device</LINE>
<LINE>By this alliance to make void my suit.</LINE>
<LINE>Before thy coming, Lewis was Henry&#8217;s friend.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. LEW.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And still is friend to him and Margaret.</LINE>
<LINE>But if your title to the crown be weak,</LINE>
<LINE>As may appear by Edward&#8217;s good success,</LINE>
<LINE>Then &#8217;tis but reason that I be releas&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>From giving aid which late I promised.</LINE>
<LINE>Yet shall you have all kindness at my hand</LINE>
<LINE>That your estate requires and mine can yield.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Henry now lives in Scotland at his ease;</LINE>
<LINE>Where having nothing, nothing can he lose.</LINE>
<LINE>And as for you yourself, our quondam queen,</LINE>
<LINE>You have a father able to maintain you,</LINE>
<LINE>And better &#8217;twere you troubled him than France.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Q. MAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Peace, impudent and shameless Warwick,</LINE>
<LINE>Proud setter-up and puller-down of kings!</LINE>
<LINE>I will not hence, till with my talk and tears</LINE>
<LINE>(Both full of truth) I make King Lewis behold</LINE>
<LINE>Thy sly conveyance and thy lord&#8217;s false love,</LINE>
<LINE>For both of you are birds of self-same feather.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Post blowing a horn within.</STAGEDIR>

</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter the Post.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord ambassador, these letters are for you,</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Speaks to Warwick.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Sent from your brother, Marquess Montague.</LINE>
<LINE>These from our king unto your Majesty.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>To Lewis.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>And, madam, these for you; from whom I know not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>To Margaret.</STAGEDIR>

<STAGEDIR>They all read their letters.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OXF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I like it well that our fair queen and mistress</LINE>
<LINE>Smiles at her news, while Warwick frowns at his.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, mark how Lewis stamps as he were nettled.</LINE>
<LINE>I hope all&#8217;s for the best.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. LEW.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Warwick, what are thy news? And yours, fair queen?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Q. MAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Mine such as fill my heart with unhop&#8217;d joys.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Mine full of sorrow and heart&#8217;s discontent.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. LEW.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What? Has your king married the Lady Grey?</LINE>
<LINE>And now to soothe your forgery and his,</LINE>
<LINE>Sends me a paper to persuade me patience?</LINE>
<LINE>Is this th&#8217; alliance that he seeks with France?</LINE>
<LINE>Dare he presume to scorn us in this manner?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Q. MAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I told your Majesty as much before:</LINE>
<LINE>This proveth Edward&#8217;s love and Warwick&#8217;s honesty.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>King Lewis, I here protest in sight of heaven,</LINE>
<LINE>And by the hope I have of heavenly bliss,</LINE>
<LINE>That I am clear from this misdeed of Edward&#8217;s;</LINE>
<LINE>No more my king, for he dishonors me,</LINE>
<LINE>But most himself if he could see his shame.</LINE>
<LINE>Did I forget that by the house of York</LINE>
<LINE>My father came untimely to his death?</LINE>
<LINE>Did I let pass th&#8217; abuse done to my niece?</LINE>
<LINE>Did I impale him with the regal crown?</LINE>
<LINE>Did I put Henry from his native right?</LINE>
<LINE>And am I guerdon&#8217;d at the last with shame?</LINE>
<LINE>Shame on himself! For my desert is honor;</LINE>
<LINE>And to repair my honor lost for him,</LINE>
<LINE>I here renounce him and return to Henry.</LINE>
<LINE>My noble queen, let former grudges pass,</LINE>
<LINE>And henceforth I am thy true servitor.</LINE>
<LINE>I will revenge his wrong to Lady Bona,</LINE>
<LINE>And replant Henry in his former state.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Q. MAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Warwick, these words have turn&#8217;d my hate to love,</LINE>
<LINE>And I forgive and quite forget old faults,</LINE>
<LINE>And joy that thou becom&#8217;st King Henry&#8217;s friend.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So much his friend, ay, his unfeigned friend,</LINE>
<LINE>That if King Lewis vouchsafe to furnish us</LINE>
<LINE>With some few bands of chosen soldiers,</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll undertake to land them on our coast,</LINE>
<LINE>And force the tyrant from his seat by war.</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis not his new-made bride shall succor him,</LINE>
<LINE>And as for Clarence, as my letters tell me,</LINE>
<LINE>He&#8217;s very likely now to fall from him,</LINE>
<LINE>For matching more for wanton lust than honor,</LINE>
<LINE>Or than for strength and safety of our country.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BONA.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Dear brother, how shall Bona be reveng&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>But by thy help to this distressed queen?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Q. MAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Renowned prince, how shall poor Henry live,</LINE>
<LINE>Unless thou rescue him from foul despair?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BONA.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My quarrel and this English queen&#8217;s are one.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And mine, fair Lady Bona, joins with yours.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. LEW.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And mine with hers, and thine, and Margaret&#8217;s.</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore, at last, I firmly am resolv&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>You shall have aid.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Q. MAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let me give humble thanks for all at once.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. LEW.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then, England&#8217;s messenger, return in post,</LINE>
<LINE>And tell false Edward, thy supposed king,</LINE>
<LINE>That Lewis of France is sending over masquers</LINE>
<LINE>To revel it with him and his new bride.</LINE>
<LINE>Thou seest what&#8217;s pass&#8217;d, go fear thy king withal.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BONA.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tell him, in hope he&#8217;ll prove a widower shortly,</LINE>
<LINE>I wear the willow garland for his sake.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Q. MAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tell him, my mourning weeds are laid aside,</LINE>
<LINE>And I am ready to put armor on.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong,</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore I&#8217;ll uncrown him ere&#8217;t be long.</LINE>
<LINE>There&#8217;s thy reward, be gone.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit Post.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. LEW.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">But, Warwick,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou and Oxford, with five thousand men,</LINE>
<LINE>Shall cross the seas and bid false Edward battle;</LINE>
<LINE>And as occasion serves, this noble queen</LINE>
<LINE>And prince shall follow with a fresh supply.</LINE>
<LINE>Yet ere thou go, but answer me one doubt:</LINE>
<LINE>What pledge have we of thy firm loyalty?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This shall assure my constant loyalty,</LINE>
<LINE>That if our queen and this young prince agree,</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll join mine eldest daughter, and my joy,</LINE>
<LINE>To him forthwith in holy wedlock bands.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Q. MAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, I agree, and thank you for your motion.</LINE>
<LINE>Son Edward, she is fair and virtuous,</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore delay not, give thy hand to Warwick,</LINE>
<LINE>And with thy hand, thy faith irrevocable</LINE>
<LINE>That only Warwick&#8217;s daughter shall be thine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, I accept her, for she well deserves it,</LINE>
<LINE>And here, to pledge my vow, I give my hand.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>He gives his hand to Warwick.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. LEW.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why stay we now? These soldiers shall be levied,</LINE>
<LINE>And thou, Lord Bourbon, our High Admiral,</LINE>
<LINE>Shall waft them over with our royal fleet.</LINE>
<LINE>I long till Edward fall by war&#8217;s mischance,</LINE>
<LINE>For mocking marriage with a dame of France.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt. Manet Warwick.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I came from Edward as ambassador,</LINE>
<LINE>But I return his sworn and mortal foe.</LINE>
<LINE>Matter of marriage was the charge he gave me,</LINE>
<LINE>But dreadful war shall answer his demand.</LINE>
<LINE>Had he none else to make a stale but me?</LINE>
<LINE>Then none but I shall turn his jest to sorrow.</LINE>
<LINE>I was the chief that rais&#8217;d him to the crown,</LINE>
<LINE>And I&#8217;ll be chief to bring him down again;</LINE>
<LINE>Not that I pity Henry&#8217;s misery,</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Now tell me, brother Clarence, what think you</LINE>

<LINE>Hath not our brother made a worthy choice?</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>And his well-chosen bride.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I mind to tell him plainly what I think.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. EDW.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, brother of Clarence, how like you our choice,</LINE>
<LINE>That you stand pensive as half malecontent?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As well as Lewis of France or the Earl of Warwick,</LINE>
<LINE>Which are so weak of courage and in judgment</LINE>
<LINE>That they&#8217;ll take no offense at our abuse.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. EDW.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Suppose they take offense without a cause;</LINE>
<LINE>They are but Lewis and Warwick, I am Edward,</LINE>
<LINE>Your king and Warwick&#8217;s, and must have my will.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And shall have your will, because our king.</LINE>
<LINE>Yet hasty marriage seldom proveth well.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. EDW.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yea, brother Richard, are you offended too?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not I.</LINE>
<LINE>No; God forbid that I should wish them sever&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>Whom God hath join&#8217;d together; ay, and &#8217;twere pity</LINE>
<LINE>To sunder them that yoke so well together.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. EDW.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Setting your scorns and your mislike aside,</LINE>
<LINE>Tell me some reason why the Lady Grey</LINE>
<LINE>Should not become my wife and England&#8217;s queen.</LINE>
<LINE>And you too, Somerset and Montague,</LINE>
<LINE>Speak freely what you think.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then this is mine opinion: that King Lewis</LINE>
<LINE>Becomes your enemy, for mocking him</LINE>
<LINE>About the marriage of the Lady Bona.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And Warwick, doing what you gave in charge,</LINE>
<LINE>Is now dishonored by this new marriage.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. EDW.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What if both Lewis and Warwick be appeas&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>By such invention as I can devise?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MONT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yet, to have join&#8217;d with France in such alliance</LINE>
<LINE>Would more have strength&#8217;ned this our commonwealth</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Gainst foreign storms than any home-bred marriage.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, knows not Montague that of itself</LINE>
<LINE>England is safe, if true within itself?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MONT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But the safer when &#8217;tis back&#8217;d with France.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HAST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis better using France than trusting France.</LINE>
<LINE>Let us be back&#8217;d with God, and with the seas,</LINE>
<LINE>Which he hath giv&#8217;n for fence impregnable,</LINE>
<LINE>And with their helps only defend ourselves:</LINE>
<LINE>In them, and in ourselves, our safety lies.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For this one speech Lord Hastings well deserves</LINE>
<LINE>To have the heir of the Lord Hungerford.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. EDW.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, what of that? It was my will and grant,</LINE>
<LINE>And for this once my will shall stand for law.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And yet methinks your Grace hath not done well</LINE>
<LINE>To give the heir and daughter of Lord Scales</LINE>
<LINE>Unto the brother of your loving bride.</LINE>
<LINE>She better would have fitted me or Clarence;</LINE>
<LINE>But in your bride you bury brotherhood.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Or else you would not have bestow&#8217;d the heir</LINE>
<LINE>Of the Lord Bonville on your new wive&#8217;s son,</LINE>
<LINE>And leave your brothers to go speed elsewhere.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>In choosing for yourself, you show&#8217;d your judgment;</LINE>

<LINE>My lords, before it pleas&#8217;d his Majesty</LINE>
<LINE>To raise my state to title of a queen,</LINE>
<LINE>Do me but right, and you must all confess</LINE>
<LINE>That I was not ignoble of descent,</LINE>
<LINE>And meaner than myself have had like fortune.</LINE>
<LINE>But as this title honors me and mine,</LINE>
<LINE>So your dislikes, to whom I would be pleasing,</LINE>
<LINE>Doth cloud my joys with danger and with sorrow.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. EDW.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My love, forbear to fawn upon their frowns.</LINE>
<LINE>What danger or what sorrow can befall thee</LINE>
<LINE>So long as Edward is thy constant friend</LINE>
<LINE>And their true sovereign whom they must obey?</LINE>
<LINE>Nay, whom they shall obey, and love thee too,</LINE>
<LINE>Unless they seek for hatred at my hands;</LINE>
<LINE>Which if they do, yet will I keep thee safe,</LINE>
<LINE>And they shall feel the vengeance of my wrath.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>POST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My sovereign liege, no letters, and few words,</LINE>
<LINE>But such as I (without your special pardon)</LINE>
<LINE>Dare not relate.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. EDW.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go to, we pardon thee; therefore, in brief,</LINE>
<LINE>Tell me their words as near as thou canst guess them.</LINE>
<LINE>What answer makes King Lewis unto our letters?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>At my depart, these were his very words:</LINE>
<LINE>&#8220;Go tell false Edward, the supposed king,</LINE>
<LINE>That Lewis of France is sending over masquers</LINE>
<LINE>To revel it with him and his new bride.&#8221;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. EDW.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is Lewis so brave? Belike he thinks me Henry.</LINE>
<LINE>But what said Lady Bona to my marriage?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>These were her words, utt&#8217;red with mild disdain:</LINE>
<LINE>&#8220;Tell him, in hope he&#8217;ll prove a widower shortly,</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll wear the willow garland for his sake.&#8221;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. EDW.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I blame not her: she could say little less;</LINE>
<LINE>She had the wrong. But what said Henry&#8217;s queen?</LINE>
<LINE>For I have heard that she was there in place.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8220;Tell him,&#8221; quoth she, &#8220;my mourning weeds are done,</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. EDW.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Belike she minds to play the Amazon.</LINE>
<LINE>But what said Warwick to these injuries?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He, more incens&#8217;d against your Majesty</LINE>
<LINE>Than all the rest, discharg&#8217;d me with these words:</LINE>
<LINE>&#8220;Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong,</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore I&#8217;ll uncrown him ere&#8217;t be long.&#8221;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. EDW.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ha? Durst the traitor breathe out so proud words?</LINE>
<LINE>Well, I will arm me, being thus forewarn&#8217;d.</LINE>
<LINE>They shall have wars, and pay for their presumption.</LINE>
<LINE>But say, is Warwick friends with Margaret?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, gracious sovereign, they are so link&#8217;d in friendship</LINE>
<LINE>That young Prince Edward marries Warwick&#8217;s daughter.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Belike the elder; Clarence will have the younger.</LINE>
<LINE>Now, brother king, farewell, and sit you fast,</LINE>
<LINE>For I will hence to Warwick&#8217;s other daughter,</LINE>
<LINE>That though I want a kingdom, yet in marriage</LINE>
<LINE>I may not prove inferior to yourself.</LINE>
<LINE>You that love me and Warwick, follow me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit Clarence, and Somerset follow.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOU.</SPEAKER>
<STAGEDIR>Aside.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Not I;</LINE>
<LINE>My thoughts aim at a further matter: I</LINE>
<LINE>Stay not for the love of Edward, but the crown.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. EDW.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Clarence and Somerset both gone to Warwick?</LINE>
<LINE>Yet am I arm&#8217;d against the worst can happen;</LINE>
<LINE>And haste is needful in this desp&#8217;rate case.</LINE>
<LINE>Pembroke and Stafford, you in our behalf</LINE>
<LINE>Go levy men, and make prepare for war;</LINE>
<LINE>They are already or quickly will be landed.</LINE>
<LINE>Myself in person will straight follow you.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt Pembroke and Stafford.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>But ere I go, Hastings and Montague,</LINE>
<LINE>Resolve my doubt. You twain, of all the rest,</LINE>
<LINE>Are near to Warwick by blood and by alliance:</LINE>
<LINE>Tell me if you love Warwick more than me?</LINE>
<LINE>If it be so, then both depart to him;</LINE>
<LINE>I rather wish you foes than hollow friends.</LINE>
<LINE>But if you mind to hold your true obedience,</LINE>
<LINE>Give me assurance with some friendly vow,</LINE>
<LINE>That I may never have you in suspect.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Thy brother being carelessly encamp&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>His soldiers lurking in the town about,</LINE>
<LINE>And but attended by a simple guard,</LINE>
<LINE>We may surprise and take him at our pleasure?</LINE>
<LINE>Our scouts have found the adventure very easy;</LINE>
<LINE>That as Ulysses and stout Diomede</LINE>
<LINE>With sleight and manhood stole to Rhesus&#8217; tents</LINE>
<LINE>And brought from thence the Thracian fatal steeds,</LINE>
<LINE>So we, well cover&#8217;d with the night&#8217;s black mantle,</LINE>
<LINE>At unawares may beat down Edward&#8217;s guard,</LINE>
<LINE>And seize himself; I say not, slaughter him,</LINE>

<LINE>You that will follow me to this attempt,</LINE>
<LINE>Applaud the name of Henry with your leader.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>They all cry, &#8220;Henry!&#8221; </STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Ay, but give me worship and quietness,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LIEU.</SPEAKER>

<SPEAKER>K. HEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For what, Lieutenant? For well using me?</LINE>
<LINE>Nay, be thou sure, I&#8217;ll well requite thy kindness,</LINE>
<LINE>For that it made my imprisonment a pleasure;</LINE>
<LINE>Ay, such a pleasure as incaged birds</LINE>
<LINE>Conceive, when, after many moody thoughts,</LINE>
<LINE>At last by notes of household harmony</LINE>
<LINE>They quite forget their loss of liberty.</LINE>
<LINE>But, Warwick, after God, thou set&#8217;st me free,</LINE>
<LINE>And chiefly therefore I thank God and thee.</LINE>
<LINE>He was the author, thou the instrument.</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore that I may conquer fortune&#8217;s spite</LINE>
<LINE>By living low, where fortune cannot hurt me,</LINE>
<LINE>And that the people of this blessed land</LINE>
<LINE>May not be punish&#8217;d with my thwarting stars,</LINE>
<LINE>Warwick, although my head still wear the crown,</LINE>

<LINE>No, Warwick, thou art worthy of the sway,</LINE>

<LINE>I mean, in bearing weight of government,</LINE>
<LINE>While he enjoys the honor and his ease.</LINE>
<LINE>And, Clarence, now then it is more than needful</LINE>

<LINE>His hand to wield a sceptre, and himself</LINE>
<LINE>Likely in time to bless a regal throne.</LINE>

<LINE>My lord, I like not of this flight of Edward&#8217;s;</LINE>

<LINE>As Henry&#8217;s late presaging prophecy</LINE>
<LINE>Did glad my heart with hope of this young Richmond,</LINE>
<LINE>So doth my heart misgive me, in these conflicts</LINE>
<LINE>What may befall him, to his harm and ours.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. EDW.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thanks, good Montgomery; but we now forget</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MONTG.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then fare you well, for I will hence again,</LINE>

<LINE>I&#8217;ll leave you to your fortune, and be gone</LINE>

<LINE>I will not ruinate my father&#8217;s house,</LINE>
<LINE>Who gave his blood to lime the stones together,</LINE>

<LINE>That Clarence is so harsh, so blunt, unnatural,</LINE>
<LINE>To bend the fatal instruments of war</LINE>
<LINE>Against his brother and his lawful king?</LINE>
<LINE>Perhaps thou wilt object my holy oath:</LINE>
<LINE>To keep that oath were more impiety</LINE>
<LINE>Than Jephthah when he sacrific&#8217;d his daughter.</LINE>
<LINE>I am so sorry for my trespass made</LINE>
<LINE>That to deserve well at my brother&#8217;s hands,</LINE>
<LINE>I here proclaim myself thy mortal foe;</LINE>
<LINE>With resolution, wheresoe&#8217;er I meet thee</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Q. MAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Great lords, wise men ne&#8217;er sit and wail their loss,</LINE>
<LINE>But cheerly seek how to redress their harms.</LINE>
<LINE>What though the mast be now blown overboard,</LINE>
<LINE>The cable broke, the holding-anchor lost,</LINE>
<LINE>And half our sailors swallow&#8217;d in the flood?</LINE>
<LINE>Yet lives our pilot still. Is&#8217;t meet that he</LINE>
<LINE>Should leave the helm and, like a fearful lad,</LINE>
<LINE>With tearful eyes add water to the sea,</LINE>
<LINE>And give more strength to that which hath too much,</LINE>
<LINE>Whiles, in his moan, the ship splits on the rock,</LINE>
<LINE>Which industry and courage might have sav&#8217;d?</LINE>
<LINE>Ah, what a shame, ah, what a fault were this!</LINE>
<LINE>Say Warwick was our anchor; what of that?</LINE>
<LINE>And Montague our topmast; what of him?</LINE>
<LINE>Our slaught&#8217;red friends the tackles; what of these?</LINE>
<LINE>Why, is not Oxford here another anchor?</LINE>
<LINE>And Somerset another goodly mast?</LINE>
<LINE>The friends of France our shrouds and tacklings?</LINE>
<LINE>And though unskillful, why not Ned and I</LINE>
<LINE>For once allow&#8217;d the skillful pilot&#8217;s charge?</LINE>
<LINE>We will not from the helm to sit and weep,</LINE>
<LINE>But keep our course (though the rough wind say no)</LINE>
<LINE>From shelves and rocks that threaten us with wrack.</LINE>
<LINE>As good to chide the waves as speak them fair.</LINE>
<LINE>And what is Edward but a ruthless sea?</LINE>
<LINE>What Clarence but a quicksand of deceit?</LINE>
<LINE>And Richard but a ragged fatal rock?</LINE>
<LINE>All these the enemies to our poor bark.</LINE>
<LINE>Say you can swim, alas, &#8217;tis but a while;</LINE>
<LINE>Tread on the sand, why, there you quickly sink;</LINE>
<LINE>Bestride the rock, the tide will wash you off,</LINE>
<LINE>Or else you famish&#8212;that&#8217;s a threefold death.</LINE>
<LINE>This speak I, lords, to let you understand,</LINE>
<LINE>If case some one of you would fly from us,</LINE>
<LINE>That there&#8217;s no hop&#8217;d-for mercy with the brothers</LINE>
<LINE>More than with ruthless waves, with sands and rocks.</LINE>
<LINE>Why, courage then! What cannot be avoided,</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Twere childish weakness to lament or fear.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRINCE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Methinks a woman of this valiant spirit</LINE>
<LINE>Should, if a coward heard her speak these words,</LINE>
<LINE>Infuse his breast with magnanimity,</LINE>
<LINE>And make him, naked, foil a man at arms.</LINE>
<LINE>I speak not this as doubting any here;</LINE>
<LINE>For did I but suspect a fearful man,</LINE>
<LINE>He should have leave to go away betimes,</LINE>
<LINE>Lest in our need he might infect another,</LINE>
<LINE>And make him of like spirit to himself.</LINE>
<LINE>If any such be here&#8212;as God forbid!&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Let him depart before we need his help.</LINE>

<LINE>Therefore no more but this: Henry, your sovereign,</LINE>
<LINE>Is prisoner to the foe, his state usurp&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>His realm a slaughter-house, his subjects slain,</LINE>
<LINE>His statutes cancell&#8217;d, and his treasure spent;</LINE>

<LINE>You fight in justice; then in God&#8217;s name, lords,</LINE>

<LINE>Teeth hadst thou in thy head when thou wast born,</LINE>
<LINE>To signify thou cam&#8217;st to bite the world;</LINE>
<LINE>And if the rest be true which I have heard,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou cam&#8217;st&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll hear no more; die, prophet, in thy speech:</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Stabs him.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>For this, amongst the rest, was I ordain&#8217;d.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. HEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, and for much more slaughter after this.</LINE>
<LINE>O God forgive my sins, and pardon thee!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Dies.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What? Will the aspiring blood of Lancaster</LINE>
<LINE>Sink in the ground? I thought it would have mounted.</LINE>
<LINE>See how my sword weeps for the poor king&#8217;s death!</LINE>
<LINE>O may such purple tears be alway shed</LINE>
<LINE>From those that wish the downfall of our house!</LINE>
<LINE>If any spark of life be yet remaining,</LINE>
<LINE>Down, down to hell, and say I sent thee thither&#8212;</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Stabs him again.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>I, that have neither pity, love, nor fear.</LINE>
<LINE>Indeed &#8217;tis true that Henry told me of;</LINE>
<LINE>For I have often heard my mother say</LINE>
<LINE>I came into the world with my legs forward.</LINE>
<LINE>Had I not reason, think ye, to make haste,</LINE>
<LINE>And seek their ruin that usurp&#8217;d our right?</LINE>
<LINE>The midwife wonder&#8217;d and the women cried,</LINE>
<LINE>&#8220;O, Jesus bless us, he is born with teeth!&#8221;</LINE>
<LINE>And so I was, which plainly signified</LINE>
<LINE>That I should snarl, and bite, and play the dog.</LINE>
<LINE>Then since the heavens have shap&#8217;d my body so,</LINE>
<LINE>Let hell make crook&#8217;d my mind to answer it.</LINE>
<LINE>I have no brother, I am like no brother;</LINE>
<LINE>And this word &#8220;love,&#8221; which greybeards call divine,</LINE>
<LINE>Be resident in men like one another,</LINE>
<LINE>And not in me: I am myself alone.</LINE>
<LINE>Clarence, beware! Thou keep&#8217;st me from the light,</LINE>
<LINE>But I will sort a pitchy day for thee;</LINE>
<LINE>For I will buzz abroad such prophecies</LINE>
<LINE>That Edward shall be fearful of his life,</LINE>
<LINE>And then to purge his fear, I&#8217;ll be thy death.</LINE>
<LINE>King Henry and the Prince his son are gone;</LINE>
<LINE>Clarence, thy turn is next, and then the rest,</LINE>
<LINE>Counting myself but bad till I be best.</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll throw thy body in another room,</LINE>
<LINE>And triumph, Henry, in thy day of doom.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit with the body.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEAKER>K. EDW.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Once more we sit in England&#8217;s royal throne,</LINE>
<LINE>Repurchas&#8217;d with the blood of enemies.</LINE>
<LINE>What valiant foemen, like to autumn&#8217;s corn,</LINE>
<LINE>Have we mow&#8217;d down in tops of all their pride!</LINE>
<LINE>Three Dukes of Somerset, threefold renown&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>For hardy and undoubted champions;</LINE>
<LINE>Two Cliffords, as the father and the son,</LINE>
<LINE>And two Northumberlands&#8212;two braver men</LINE>
<LINE>Ne&#8217;er spurr&#8217;d their coursers at the trumpet&#8217;s sound;</LINE>
<LINE>With them, the two brave bears, Warwick and Montague,</LINE>
<LINE>That in their chains fetter&#8217;d the kingly lion,</LINE>
<LINE>And made the forest tremble when they roar&#8217;d.</LINE>
<LINE>Thus have we swept suspicion from our seat,</LINE>
<LINE>And made our footstool of security.</LINE>
<LINE>Come hither, Bess, and let me kiss my boy.</LINE>
<LINE>Young Ned, for thee, thine uncles and myself</LINE>
<LINE>Have in our armors watch&#8217;d the winter&#8217;s night,</LINE>
<LINE>Went all afoot in summer&#8217;s scalding heat,</LINE>
<LINE>That thou mightst repossess the crown in peace,</LINE>
<LINE>And of our labors thou shalt reap the gain.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Aside.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll blast his harvest, and your head were laid,</LINE>
<LINE>For yet I am not look&#8217;d on in the world.</LINE>
<LINE>This shoulder was ordain&#8217;d so thick to heave,</LINE>
<LINE>And heave it shall some weight, or break my back:</LINE>
<LINE>Work thou the way&#8212;and that shall execute.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. EDW.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Clarence and Gloucester, love my lovely queen,</LINE>
<LINE>And kiss your princely nephew, brothers both.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>The duty that I owe unto your Majesty</LINE>
<LINE>I seal upon the lips of this sweet babe.</LINE>

<SPEAKER alias="L. GREY.">Q. ELIZ.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thanks, noble Clarence, worthy brother, thanks.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And that I love the tree from whence thou sprang&#8217;st,</LINE>
<LINE>Witness the loving kiss I give the fruit.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Aside.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>To say the truth, so Judas kiss&#8217;d his master,</LINE>
<LINE>And cried &#8220;All hail!&#8221; when as he meant all harm.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. EDW.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now am I seated as my soul delights,</LINE>
<LINE>Having my country&#8217;s peace and brothers&#8217; loves.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>CLAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What will your Grace have done with Margaret?</LINE>
<LINE>Reignier, her father, to the King of France</LINE>
<LINE>Hath pawn&#8217;d the Sicils and Jerusalem,</LINE>
<LINE>And hither have they sent it for her ransom.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>K. EDW.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Away with her, and waft her hence to France.</LINE>
<LINE>And now what rests but that we spend the time</LINE>
<LINE>With stately triumphs, mirthful comic shows,</LINE>
<LINE>Such as befits the pleasure of the court?</LINE>
<LINE>Sound drums and trumpets! Farewell sour annoy!</LINE>
<LINE>For here I hope begins our lasting joy.</LINE>
