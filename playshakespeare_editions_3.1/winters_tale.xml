<STAGEDIR>Enter Camillo and Archidamus.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARCH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If you shall chance, Camillo, to visit Bohemia on the like occasion whereon my services are now on foot, you shall see (as I have said) great difference betwixt our Bohemia and your Sicilia.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I think, this coming summer, the King of Sicilia means to pay Bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARCH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Wherein our entertainment shall shame us: we will be justified in our loves; for indeed&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Beseech you&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARCH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Verily, I speak it in the freedom of my knowledge: we cannot with such magnificence&#8212;in so rare&#8212;I know not what to say&#8212;We will give you sleepy drinks, that your senses (unintelligent of our insufficience) may, though they cannot praise us, as little accuse us.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You pay a great deal too dear for what&#8217;s given freely.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARCH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Believe me, I speak as my understanding instructs me, and as mine honesty puts it to utterance.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sicilia cannot show himself overkind to Bohemia. They were train&#8217;d together in their childhoods; and there rooted betwixt them then such an affection, which cannot choose but branch now. Since their more mature dignities and royal necessities made separation of their society, their encounters (though not personal) hath been royally attorney&#8217;d with interchange of gifts, letters, loving embassies, that they have seem&#8217;d to be together, though absent; shook hands, as over a vast; and embrac&#8217;d as it were from the ends of oppos&#8217;d winds. The heavens continue their loves!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARCH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I think there is not in the world either malice or matter to alter it. You have an unspeakable comfort of your young prince Mamillius: it is a gentleman of the greatest promise that ever came into my note.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I very well agree with you in the hopes of him; it is a gallant child; one that, indeed, physics the subject, makes old hearts fresh. They that went on crutches ere he was born desire yet their life to see him a man.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARCH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Would they else be content to die?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes; if there were no other excuse why they should desire to live.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ARCH.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If the King had no son, they would desire to live on crutches till he had one.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nine changes of the wat&#8217;ry star hath been</LINE>
<LINE>The shepherd&#8217;s note since we have left our throne</LINE>
<LINE>Without a burden. Time as long again</LINE>
<LINE>Would be fill&#8217;d up, my brother, with our thanks,</LINE>
<LINE>And yet we should, for perpetuity,</LINE>
<LINE>Go hence in debt. And therefore, like a cipher</LINE>
<LINE>(Yet standing in rich place), I multiply</LINE>
<LINE>With one &#8220;We thank you&#8221; many thousands more</LINE>
<LINE>That go before it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Stay your thanks a while,</LINE>
<LINE>And pay them when you part.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">Sir, that&#8217;s tomorrow.</LINE>
<LINE>I am question&#8217;d by my fears of what may chance</LINE>
<LINE>Or breed upon our absence, that may blow</LINE>
<LINE>No sneaping winds at home, to make us say,</LINE>
<LINE>&#8220;This is put forth too truly.&#8221; Besides, I have stay&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>To tire your royalty.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">We are tougher, brother,</LINE>
<LINE>Than you can put us to&#8217;t.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">No longer stay.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>One sev&#8217;nnight longer.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Very sooth, tomorrow.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We&#8217;ll part the time between &#8217;s then; and in that</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll no gainsaying.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Press me not, beseech you, so.</LINE>
<LINE>There is no tongue that moves, none, none i&#8217; th&#8217; world,</LINE>
<LINE>So soon as yours could win me. So it should now,</LINE>
<LINE>Were there necessity in your request, although</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Twere needful I denied it. My affairs</LINE>
<LINE>Do even drag me homeward; which to hinder</LINE>
<LINE>Were (in your love) a whip to me; my stay,</LINE>
<LINE>To you a charge and trouble. To save both,</LINE>
<LINE>Farewell, our brother.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Tongue-tied our queen? Speak you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I had thought, sir, to have held my peace until</LINE>
<LINE>You had drawn oaths from him not to stay. You, sir,</LINE>
<LINE>Charge him too coldly. Tell him you are sure</LINE>
<LINE>All in Bohemia&#8217;s well; this satisfaction</LINE>
<LINE>The by-gone day proclaim&#8217;d. Say this to him,</LINE>
<LINE>He&#8217;s beat from his best ward.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">Well said, Hermione.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To tell he longs to see his son were strong;</LINE>
<LINE>But let him say so then, and let him go;</LINE>
<LINE>But let him swear so, and he shall not stay,</LINE>
<LINE>We&#8217;ll thwack him hence with distaffs.</LINE>
<LINE>Yet of your royal presence I&#8217;ll adventure</LINE>
<LINE>The borrow of a week. When at Bohemia</LINE>
<LINE>You take my lord, I&#8217;ll give him my commission</LINE>
<LINE>To let him there a month behind the gest</LINE>
<LINE>Prefix&#8217;d for &#8217;s parting; yet, good deed, Leontes,</LINE>
<LINE>I love thee not a jar o&#8217; th&#8217; clock behind</LINE>
<LINE>What lady she her lord. You&#8217;ll stay?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">No, madam.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, but you will?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">I may not, verily.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Verily?</LINE>
<LINE>You put me off with limber vows; but I,</LINE>
<LINE>Though you would seek t&#8217; unsphere the stars with oaths,</LINE>
<LINE>Should yet say, &#8220;Sir, no going.&#8221; Verily,</LINE>
<LINE>You shall not go; a lady&#8217;s &#8220;verily&#8221; is</LINE>
<LINE>As potent as a lord&#8217;s. Will you go yet?</LINE>
<LINE>Force me to keep you as a prisoner,</LINE>
<LINE>Not like a guest: so you shall pay your fees</LINE>
<LINE>When you depart, and save your thanks. How say you?</LINE>
<LINE>My prisoner? Or my guest? By your dread &#8220;verily,&#8221;</LINE>
<LINE>One of them you shall be.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Your guest then, madam.</LINE>
<LINE>To be your prisoner should import offending,</LINE>
<LINE>Which is for me less easy to commit</LINE>
<LINE>Than you to punish.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Not your jailer then,</LINE>
<LINE>But your kind hostess. Come, I&#8217;ll question you</LINE>
<LINE>Of my lord&#8217;s tricks and yours when you were boys.</LINE>
<LINE>You were pretty lordings then?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">We were, fair queen,</LINE>
<LINE>Two lads that thought there was no more behind</LINE>
<LINE>But such a day tomorrow as today,</LINE>
<LINE>And to be boy eternal.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Was not my lord</LINE>
<LINE>The verier wag o&#8217; th&#8217; two?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We were as twinn&#8217;d lambs that did frisk i&#8217; th&#8217; sun,</LINE>
<LINE>And bleat the one at th&#8217; other. What we chang&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>Was innocence for innocence; we knew not</LINE>
<LINE>The doctrine of ill-doing, nor dream&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>That any did. Had we pursu&#8217;d that life,</LINE>
<LINE>And our weak spirits ne&#8217;er been higher rear&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>With stronger blood, we should have answer&#8217;d heaven</LINE>
<LINE>Boldly, &#8220;Not guilty&#8221;; the imposition clear&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Hereditary ours.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">By this we gather</LINE>
<LINE>You have tripp&#8217;d since.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">O my most sacred lady,</LINE>
<LINE>Temptations have since then been born to &#8217;s: for</LINE>
<LINE>In those unfledg&#8217;d days was my wife a girl;</LINE>
<LINE>Your precious self had then not cross&#8217;d the eyes</LINE>
<LINE>Of my young playfellow.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Grace to boot!</LINE>
<LINE>Of this make no conclusion, lest you say</LINE>
<LINE>Your queen and I are devils. Yet go on,</LINE>
<LINE>Th&#8217; offenses we have made you do we&#8217;ll answer,</LINE>
<LINE>If you first sinn&#8217;d with us, and that with us</LINE>
<LINE>You did continue fault, and that you slipp&#8217;d not</LINE>
<LINE>With any but with us.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Is he won yet?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He&#8217;ll stay, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">At my request he would not.</LINE>
<LINE>Hermione, my dearest, thou never spok&#8217;st</LINE>
<LINE>To better purpose.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Never?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Never, but once.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What? Have I twice said well? When was&#8217;t before?</LINE>
<LINE>I prithee tell me; cram &#8217;s with praise, and make &#8217;s</LINE>
<LINE>As fat as tame things. One good deed dying tongueless</LINE>
<LINE>Slaughters a thousand waiting upon that.</LINE>
<LINE>Our praises are our wages. You may ride &#8217;s</LINE>
<LINE>With one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere</LINE>
<LINE>With spur we heat an acre. But to th&#8217; goal:</LINE>
<LINE>My last good deed was to entreat his stay;</LINE>
<LINE>What was my first? It has an elder sister,</LINE>
<LINE>Or I mistake you. O, would her name were Grace!</LINE>
<LINE>But once before I spoke to th&#8217; purpose? When?</LINE>
<LINE>Nay, let me have&#8217;t; I long.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Why, that was when</LINE>
<LINE>Three crabbed months had sour&#8217;d themselves to death,</LINE>
<LINE>Ere I could make thee open thy white hand,</LINE>
<LINE>And clap thyself my love; then didst thou utter,</LINE>
<LINE>&#8220;I am yours forever.&#8221;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">&#8217;Tis Grace indeed.</LINE>
<LINE>Why, lo you now! I have spoke to th&#8217; purpose twice:</LINE>
<LINE>The one forever earn&#8217;d a royal husband;</LINE>
<LINE>Th&#8217; other for some while a friend.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Gives her hand to Polixenes.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<STAGEDIR>Aside.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE offset="7">Too hot, too hot!</LINE>
<LINE>To mingle friendship far is mingling bloods.</LINE>
<LINE>I have <LATIN lang="la">tremor cordis</LATIN> on me; my heart dances,</LINE>
<LINE>But not for joy; not joy. This entertainment</LINE>
<LINE>May a free face put on, derive a liberty</LINE>
<LINE>From heartiness, from bounty, fertile bosom,</LINE>
<LINE>And well become the agent; &#8217;t may&#8212;I grant.</LINE>
<LINE>But to be paddling palms and pinching fingers,</LINE>
<LINE>As now they are, and making practic&#8217;d smiles,</LINE>
<LINE>As in a looking-glass; and then to sigh, as &#8217;twere</LINE>
<LINE>The mort o&#8217; th&#8217; deer&#8212;O, that is entertainment</LINE>
<LINE>My bosom likes not, nor my brows! Mamillius,</LINE>
<LINE>Art thou my boy?</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Ay, my good lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="8">I&#8217; fecks!</LINE>
<LINE>Why, that&#8217;s my bawcock. What? Hast smutch&#8217;d thy nose?</LINE>
<LINE>They say it is a copy out of mine. Come, captain,</LINE>
<LINE>We must be neat; not neat, but cleanly, captain:</LINE>
<LINE>And yet the steer, the heckfer, and the calf</LINE>
<LINE>Are all call&#8217;d neat.&#8212;Still virginalling</LINE>
<LINE>Upon his palm?&#8212;How now, you wanton calf,</LINE>
<LINE>Art thou my calf?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Yes, if you will, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou want&#8217;st a rough pash and the shoots that I have,</LINE>
<LINE>To be full like me; yet they say we are</LINE>
<LINE>Almost as like as eggs; women say so&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>That will say any thing. But were they false</LINE>
<LINE>As o&#8217;er-dy&#8217;d blacks, as wind, as waters, false</LINE>
<LINE>As dice are to be wish&#8217;d by one that fixes</LINE>
<LINE>No bourn &#8217;twixt his and mine, yet were it true</LINE>
<LINE>To say this boy were like me. Come, sir page,</LINE>
<LINE>Look on me with your welkin eye. Sweet villain!</LINE>
<LINE>Most dear&#8217;st! My collop! Can thy dam?&#8212;may&#8217;t be?&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Affection! Thy intention stabs the centre.</LINE>
<LINE>Thou dost make possible things not so held,</LINE>
<LINE>Communicat&#8217;st with dreams (how can this be?),</LINE>
<LINE>With what&#8217;s unreal thou co-active art,</LINE>
<LINE>And fellow&#8217;st nothing. Then &#8217;tis very credent</LINE>
<LINE>Thou mayst co-join with something, and thou dost</LINE>
<LINE>(And that beyond commission), and I find it</LINE>
<LINE>(And that to the infection of my brains</LINE>
<LINE>And hard&#8217;ning of my brows).</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">What means Sicilia?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He something seems unsettled.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">How? My lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What cheer? How is&#8217;t with you, best brother?</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="9">You look</LINE>
<LINE>As if you held a brow of much distraction.</LINE>
<LINE>Are you mov&#8217;d, my lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">No, in good earnest.</LINE>
<LINE>How sometimes nature will betray its folly!</LINE>
<LINE>Its tenderness! And make itself a pastime</LINE>
<LINE>To harder bosoms! Looking on the lines</LINE>
<LINE>Of my boy&#8217;s face, methoughts I did recoil</LINE>
<LINE>Twenty-three years, and saw myself unbreech&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>In my green velvet coat, my dagger muzzled,</LINE>
<LINE>Lest it should bite its master, and so prove</LINE>
<LINE>(As ornament oft does) too dangerous.</LINE>
<LINE>How like (methought) I then was to this kernel,</LINE>
<LINE>This squash, this gentleman. Mine honest friend,</LINE>
<LINE>Will you take eggs for money?</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, my lord, I&#8217;ll fight.</LINE>

<LINE>Are you so fond of your young prince as we</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">If at home, sir,</LINE>
<LINE>He&#8217;s all my exercise, my mirth, my matter;</LINE>
<LINE>Now my sworn friend, and then mine enemy;</LINE>
<LINE>My parasite, my soldier, statesman, all.</LINE>
<LINE>He makes a July&#8217;s day short as December,</LINE>
<LINE>And with his varying childness cures in me</LINE>
<LINE>Thoughts that would thick my blood.</LINE>

<LINE offset="8">So stands this squire</LINE>
<LINE>Offic&#8217;d with me. We two will walk, my lord,</LINE>

<LINE>Let what is dear in Sicily be cheap.</LINE>
<LINE>Next to thyself and my young rover, he&#8217;s</LINE>

<SPEAKER>HER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">If you would seek us,</LINE>

<LINE offset="6">Gone already!</LINE>
<LINE>Inch-thick, knee-deep, o&#8217;er head and ears a fork&#8217;d one!</LINE>
<LINE>Go play, boy, play. Thy mother plays, and I</LINE>
<LINE>Play too, but so disgrac&#8217;d a part, whose issue</LINE>
<LINE>Will hiss me to my grave: contempt and clamor</LINE>
<LINE>Will be my knell. Go play, boy, play. There have been</LINE>
<LINE>(Or I am much deceiv&#8217;d) cuckolds ere now,</LINE>
<LINE>And many a man there is (even at this present,</LINE>
<LINE>Now, while I speak this) holds his wife by th&#8217; arm,</LINE>
<LINE>That little thinks she has been sluic&#8217;d in &#8217;s absence,</LINE>
<LINE>And his pond fish&#8217;d by his next neighbor&#8212;by</LINE>
<LINE>Sir Smile, his neighbor. Nay, there&#8217;s comfort in&#8217;t,</LINE>
<LINE>Whiles other men have gates, and those gates open&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>As mine, against their will. Should all despair</LINE>
<LINE>That have revolted wives, the tenth of mankind</LINE>
<LINE>Would hang themselves. Physic for&#8217;t there&#8217;s none.</LINE>

<LINE>No barricado for a belly. Know&#8217;t,</LINE>
<LINE>It will let in and out the enemy,</LINE>
<LINE>With bag and baggage. Many thousand on &#8217;s</LINE>
<LINE>Have the disease, and feel&#8217;t not. How now, boy?</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am like you, they say.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Why, that&#8217;s some comfort.</LINE>
<LINE>What? Camillo there?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, my good lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go play, Mamillius, thou&#8217;rt an honest man.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exit Mamillius.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Camillo, this great sir will yet stay longer.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You had much ado to make his anchor hold,</LINE>
<LINE>When you cast out, it still came home.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="8">Didst note it?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He would not stay at your petitions, made</LINE>
<LINE>His business more material.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">Didst perceive it?</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Aside.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>They&#8217;re here with me already, whisp&#8217;ring, rounding:</LINE>
<LINE>&#8220;Sicilia is a so-forth.&#8221; &#8217;Tis far gone,</LINE>
<LINE>When I shall gust it last.&#8212;How came&#8217;t, Camillo,</LINE>
<LINE>That he did stay?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">At the good Queen&#8217;s entreaty.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>At the Queen&#8217;s be&#8217;t; &#8220;good&#8221; should be pertinent,</LINE>
<LINE>But so it is, it is not. Was this taken</LINE>
<LINE>By any understanding pate but thine?</LINE>
<LINE>For thy conceit is soaking, will draw in</LINE>
<LINE>More than the common blocks. Not noted, is&#8217;t,</LINE>
<LINE>But of the finer natures? By some severals</LINE>
<LINE>Of head-piece extraordinary? Lower messes</LINE>
<LINE>Perchance are to this business purblind? Say.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Business, my lord? I think most understand</LINE>
<LINE>Bohemia stays here longer.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">Ha?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">Stays here longer.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, but why?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To satisfy your Highness and the entreaties</LINE>
<LINE>Of our most gracious mistress.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">Satisfy?</LINE>
<LINE>Th&#8217; entreaties of your mistress? Satisfy?</LINE>
<LINE>Let that suffice. I have trusted thee, Camillo,</LINE>
<LINE>With all the nearest things to my heart, as well</LINE>
<LINE>My chamber-councils, wherein, priest-like, thou</LINE>
<LINE>Hast cleans&#8217;d my bosom: I from thee departed</LINE>
<LINE>Thy penitent reform&#8217;d. But we have been</LINE>
<LINE>Deceiv&#8217;d in thy integrity, deceiv&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>In that which seems so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Be it forbid, my lord!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To bide upon&#8217;t: thou art not honest; or</LINE>
<LINE>If thou inclin&#8217;st that way, thou art a coward,</LINE>
<LINE>Which hoxes honesty behind, restraining</LINE>
<LINE>From course requir&#8217;d; or else thou must be counted</LINE>
<LINE>A servant grafted in my serious trust</LINE>
<LINE>And therein negligent; or else a fool,</LINE>
<LINE>That seest a game play&#8217;d home, the rich stake drawn,</LINE>
<LINE>And tak&#8217;st it all for jest.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">My gracious lord,</LINE>
<LINE>I may be negligent, foolish, and fearful:</LINE>
<LINE>In every one of these no man is free</LINE>
<LINE>But that his negligence, his folly, fear,</LINE>
<LINE>Among the infinite doings of the world,</LINE>
<LINE>Sometime puts forth. In your affairs, my lord,</LINE>
<LINE>If ever I were willful-negligent,</LINE>
<LINE>It was my folly; if industriously</LINE>
<LINE>I play&#8217;d the fool, it was my negligence,</LINE>
<LINE>Not weighing well the end; if ever fearful</LINE>
<LINE>To do a thing, where I the issue doubted,</LINE>
<LINE>Whereof the execution did cry out</LINE>
<LINE>Against the non-performance, &#8217;twas a fear</LINE>
<LINE>Which oft infects the wisest: these, my lord,</LINE>
<LINE>Are such allow&#8217;d infirmities that honesty</LINE>
<LINE>Is never free of. But beseech your Grace</LINE>
<LINE>Be plainer with me, let me know my trespass</LINE>
<LINE>By its own visage. If I then deny it,</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis none of mine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Ha&#8217; not you seen, Camillo</LINE>
<LINE>(But that&#8217;s past doubt; you have, or your eye-glass</LINE>
<LINE>Is thicker than a cuckold&#8217;s horn), or heard</LINE>
<LINE>(For to a vision so apparent rumor</LINE>
<LINE>Cannot be mute), or thought (for cogitation</LINE>
<LINE>Resides not in that man that does not think)</LINE>
<LINE>My wife is slippery? If thou wilt confess,</LINE>
<LINE>Or else be impudently negative,</LINE>
<LINE>To have nor eyes nor ears nor thought, then say</LINE>
<LINE>My wife&#8217;s a hobby-horse, deserves a name</LINE>
<LINE>As rank as any flax-wench that puts to</LINE>
<LINE>Before her troth-plight: say&#8217;t and justify&#8217;t.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would not be a stander-by to hear</LINE>
<LINE>My sovereign mistress clouded so, without</LINE>
<LINE>My present vengeance taken. &#8217;Shrew my heart,</LINE>
<LINE>You never spoke what did become you less</LINE>
<LINE>Than this; which to reiterate were sin</LINE>
<LINE>As deep as that, though true.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">Is whispering nothing?</LINE>
<LINE>Is leaning cheek to cheek? Is meeting noses?</LINE>
<LINE>Kissing with inside lip? Stopping the career</LINE>
<LINE>Of laughter with a sigh (a note infallible</LINE>
<LINE>Of breaking honesty)? Horsing foot on foot?</LINE>
<LINE>Skulking in corners? Wishing clocks more swift?</LINE>
<LINE>Hours, minutes? Noon, midnight? And all eyes</LINE>
<LINE>Blind with the pin and web but theirs, theirs only,</LINE>
<LINE>That would unseen be wicked? Is this nothing?</LINE>
<LINE>Why then the world and all that&#8217;s in&#8217;t is nothing,</LINE>
<LINE>The covering sky is nothing, Bohemia nothing,</LINE>
<LINE>My wife is nothing, nor nothing have these nothings,</LINE>
<LINE>If this be nothing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE offset="4">Good my lord, be cur&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>Of this diseas&#8217;d opinion, and betimes,</LINE>

<LINE>No, no, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">It is: you lie, you lie!</LINE>
<LINE>I say thou liest, Camillo, and I hate thee,</LINE>
<LINE>Pronounce thee a gross lout, a mindless slave,</LINE>
<LINE>Or else a hovering temporizer, that</LINE>
<LINE>Canst with thine eyes at once see good and evil,</LINE>
<LINE>Inclining to them both. Were my wive&#8217;s liver</LINE>
<LINE>Infected as her life, she would not live</LINE>
<LINE>The running of one glass.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Who does infect her?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, he that wears her like her medal hanging</LINE>
<LINE>About his neck, Bohemia&#8212;who, if I</LINE>
<LINE>Had servants true about me, that bare eyes</LINE>
<LINE>To see alike mine honor as their profits</LINE>
<LINE>(Their own particular thrifts), they would do that</LINE>
<LINE>Which should undo more doing; ay, and thou,</LINE>
<LINE>His cupbearer&#8212;whom I from meaner form</LINE>
<LINE>Have bench&#8217;d and rear&#8217;d to worship, who mayst see</LINE>
<LINE>Plainly as heaven sees earth and earth sees heaven,</LINE>
<LINE>How I am gall&#8217;d&#8212;mightst bespice a cup,</LINE>
<LINE>To give mine enemy a lasting wink;</LINE>
<LINE>Which draught to me were cordial.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">Sir, my lord,</LINE>
<LINE>I could do this, and that with no rash potion,</LINE>
<LINE>But with a ling&#8217;ring dram that should not work</LINE>
<LINE>Maliciously, like poison; but I cannot</LINE>
<LINE>Believe this crack to be in my dread mistress</LINE>
<LINE>(So sovereignly being honorable).</LINE>
<LINE>I have lov&#8217;d thee&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Make that thy question, and go rot!</LINE>
<LINE>Dost think I am so muddy, so unsettled,</LINE>
<LINE>To appoint myself in this vexation, sully</LINE>
<LINE>The purity and whiteness of my sheets</LINE>
<LINE>(Which to preserve is sleep, which being spotted</LINE>
<LINE>Is goads, thorns, nettles, tails of wasps),</LINE>
<LINE>Give scandal to the blood o&#8217; th&#8217; Prince my son</LINE>
<LINE>(Who I do think is mine and love as mine),</LINE>
<LINE>Without ripe moving to&#8217;t? Would I do this?</LINE>
<LINE>Could man so blench?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">I must believe you, sir.</LINE>
<LINE>I do, and will fetch off Bohemia for&#8217;t;</LINE>
<LINE>Provided that, when he&#8217;s remov&#8217;d, your Highness</LINE>
<LINE>Will take again your queen as yours at first,</LINE>
<LINE>Even for your son&#8217;s sake, and thereby for sealing</LINE>
<LINE>The injury of tongues in courts and kingdoms</LINE>
<LINE>Known and allied to yours.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Thou dost advise me</LINE>
<LINE>Even so as I mine own course have set down.</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll give no blemish to her honor, none.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord,</LINE>
<LINE>Go then; and with a countenance as clear</LINE>
<LINE>As friendship wears at feasts, keep with Bohemia</LINE>
<LINE>And with your queen. I am his cupbearer:</LINE>
<LINE>If from me he have wholesome beverage,</LINE>
<LINE>Account me not your servant.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">This is all:</LINE>
<LINE>Do&#8217;t, and thou hast the one half of my heart;</LINE>
<LINE>Do&#8217;t not, thou split&#8217;st thine own.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O miserable lady! But for me,</LINE>
<LINE>What case stand I in? I must be the poisoner</LINE>
<LINE>Of good Polixenes, and my ground to do&#8217;t</LINE>
<LINE>Is the obedience to a master; one</LINE>
<LINE>Who, in rebellion with himself, will have</LINE>
<LINE>All that are his so too. To do this deed,</LINE>
<LINE>Promotion follows. If I could find example</LINE>
<LINE>Of thousands that had struck anointed kings</LINE>
<LINE>And flourish&#8217;d after, I&#8217;ld not do&#8217;t; but since</LINE>
<LINE>Nor brass nor stone nor parchment bears not one,</LINE>
<LINE>Let villainy itself forswear&#8217;t. I must</LINE>
<LINE>Forsake the court. To do&#8217;t, or no, is certain</LINE>
<LINE>To me a break-neck. Happy star reign now!</LINE>
<LINE>Here comes Bohemia.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Polixenes.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">This is strange; methinks</LINE>

<LINE>Good day, Camillo.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Hail, most royal sir!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What is the news i&#8217; th&#8217; court?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">None rare, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The King hath on him such a countenance</LINE>
<LINE>As he had lost some province and a region</LINE>
<LINE>Lov&#8217;d as he loves himself. Even now I met him</LINE>
<LINE>With customary compliment, when he,</LINE>
<LINE>Wafting his eyes to th&#8217; contrary and falling</LINE>
<LINE>A lip of much contempt, speeds from me, and</LINE>
<LINE>So leaves me to consider what is breeding</LINE>
<LINE>That changes thus his manners.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I dare not know, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How, dare not? Do not? Do you know, and dare not?</LINE>
<LINE>Be intelligent to me, &#8217;tis thereabouts:</LINE>
<LINE>For to yourself, what you do know, you must,</LINE>
<LINE>And cannot say you dare not. Good Camillo,</LINE>
<LINE>Your chang&#8217;d complexions are to me a mirror</LINE>
<LINE>Which shows me mine chang&#8217;d too; for I must be</LINE>
<LINE>A party in this alteration, finding</LINE>
<LINE>Myself thus alter&#8217;d with&#8217;t.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">There is a sickness</LINE>
<LINE>Which puts some of us in distemper, but</LINE>
<LINE>I cannot name the disease, and it is caught</LINE>
<LINE>Of you that yet are well.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">How caught of me?</LINE>
<LINE>Make me not sighted like the basilisk.</LINE>
<LINE>I have look&#8217;d on thousands, who have sped the better</LINE>
<LINE>By my regard, but kill&#8217;d none so. Camillo,</LINE>
<LINE>As you are certainly a gentleman, thereto</LINE>
<LINE>Clerk-like experienc&#8217;d, which no less adorns</LINE>
<LINE>Our gentry than our parents&#8217; noble names,</LINE>
<LINE>In whose success we are gentle, I beseech you,</LINE>
<LINE>If you know aught which does behove my knowledge</LINE>
<LINE>Thereof to be inform&#8217;d, imprison&#8217;t not</LINE>
<LINE>In ignorant concealment.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">I may not answer.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A sickness caught of me, and yet I well?</LINE>
<LINE>I must be answer&#8217;d. Dost thou hear, Camillo,</LINE>
<LINE>I conjure thee, by all the parts of man</LINE>
<LINE>Which honor does acknowledge, whereof the least</LINE>
<LINE>Is not this suit of mine, that thou declare</LINE>
<LINE>What incidency thou dost guess of harm</LINE>
<LINE>Is creeping toward me; how far off, how near,</LINE>
<LINE>Which way to be prevented, if to be;</LINE>
<LINE>If not, how best to bear it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Sir, I will tell you,</LINE>
<LINE>Since I am charg&#8217;d in honor and by him</LINE>
<LINE>That I think honorable. Therefore mark my counsel,</LINE>
<LINE>Which must be ev&#8217;n as swiftly followed as</LINE>
<LINE>I mean to utter it; or both yourself and me</LINE>
<LINE>Cry lost, and so good night!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">On, good Camillo.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am appointed him to murder you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By whom, Camillo?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">By the King.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">For what?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He thinks, nay, with all confidence he swears,</LINE>
<LINE>As he had seen&#8217;t or been an instrument</LINE>
<LINE>To vice you to&#8217;t, that you have touch&#8217;d his queen</LINE>
<LINE>Forbiddenly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="3">O then, my best blood turn</LINE>
<LINE>To an infected jelly, and my name</LINE>
<LINE>Be yok&#8217;d with his that did betray the Best!</LINE>
<LINE>Turn then my freshest reputation to</LINE>
<LINE>A savor that may strike the dullest nostril</LINE>
<LINE>Where I arrive, and my approach be shunn&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Nay, hated too, worse than the great&#8217;st infection</LINE>
<LINE>That e&#8217;er was heard or read!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">Swear his thought over</LINE>
<LINE>By each particular star in heaven, and</LINE>
<LINE>By all their influences, you may as well</LINE>
<LINE>Forbid the sea for to obey the moon</LINE>
<LINE>As or by oath remove or counsel shake</LINE>
<LINE>The fabric of his folly, whose foundation</LINE>
<LINE>Is pil&#8217;d upon his faith, and will continue</LINE>
<LINE>The standing of his body.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">How should this grow?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know not; but I am sure &#8217;tis safer to</LINE>
<LINE>Avoid what&#8217;s grown than question how &#8217;tis born.</LINE>
<LINE>If therefore you dare trust my honesty,</LINE>
<LINE>That lies enclosed in this trunk which you</LINE>
<LINE>Shall bear along impawn&#8217;d, away tonight!</LINE>
<LINE>Your followers I will whisper to the business,</LINE>
<LINE>And will by twos and threes at several posterns</LINE>
<LINE>Clear them o&#8217; th&#8217; city. For myself, I&#8217;ll put</LINE>
<LINE>My fortunes to your service, which are here</LINE>
<LINE>By this discovery lost. Be not uncertain,</LINE>
<LINE>For by the honor of my parents, I</LINE>
<LINE>Have utt&#8217;red truth; which if you seek to prove,</LINE>
<LINE>I dare not stand by; nor shall you be safer</LINE>
<LINE>Than one condemn&#8217;d by the King&#8217;s own mouth&#8212;thereon</LINE>
<LINE>His execution sworn.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">I do believe thee:</LINE>
<LINE>I saw his heart in &#8217;s face. Give me thy hand,</LINE>
<LINE>Be pilot to me, and thy places shall</LINE>
<LINE>Still neighbor mine. My ships are ready, and</LINE>
<LINE>My people did expect my hence departure</LINE>
<LINE>Two days ago. This jealousy</LINE>
<LINE>Is for a precious creature: as she&#8217;s rare,</LINE>
<LINE>Must it be great; and as his person&#8217;s mighty,</LINE>
<LINE>Must it be violent; and as he does conceive</LINE>
<LINE>He is dishonor&#8217;d by a man which ever</LINE>
<LINE>Profess&#8217;d to him, why, his revenges must</LINE>
<LINE>In that be made more bitter. Fear o&#8217;ershades me.</LINE>
<LINE>Good expedition be my friend, and comfort</LINE>
<LINE>The gracious queen, part of his theme, but nothing</LINE>
<LINE>Of his ill-ta&#8217;en suspicion! Come, Camillo,</LINE>
<LINE>I will respect thee as a father, if</LINE>
<LINE>Thou bear&#8217;st my life off. Hence! Let us avoid.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HER.</SPEAKER>

<LINE>I am for you again. Pray you sit by us,</LINE>

<SPEAKER>MAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Merry, or sad, shall&#8217;t be?</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As merry as you will.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A sad tale&#8217;s best for winter. I have one</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Let&#8217;s have that, good sir.</LINE>
<LINE>Come on, sit down, come on, and do your best</LINE>
<LINE>To fright me with your sprites; you&#8217;re pow&#8217;rful at it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There was a man&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Nay, come sit down; then on.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Dwelt by a churchyard. I will tell it softly,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">Come on then,</LINE>
<LINE>And give&#8217;t me in mine ear.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Leontes, Antigonus, Lords, and others.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Was he met there? His train? Camillo with him?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. LORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Behind the tuft of pines I met them; never</LINE>
<LINE>Saw I men scour so on their way. I ey&#8217;d them</LINE>
<LINE>Even to their ships.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">How blest am I</LINE>
<LINE>In my just censure! In my true opinion!</LINE>
<LINE>Alack, for lesser knowledge! How accurs&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>In being so blest! There may be in the cup</LINE>
<LINE>A spider steep&#8217;d, and one may drink; depart,</LINE>
<LINE>And yet partake no venom (for his knowledge</LINE>
<LINE>Is not infected), but if one present</LINE>
<LINE>Th&#8217; abhorr&#8217;d ingredient to his eye, make known</LINE>
<LINE>How he hath drunk, he cracks his gorge, his sides,</LINE>
<LINE>With violent hefts. I have drunk, and seen the spider.</LINE>
<LINE>Camillo was his help in this, his pandar.</LINE>
<LINE>There is a plot against my life, my crown;</LINE>
<LINE>All&#8217;s true that is mistrusted. That false villain</LINE>
<LINE>Whom I employ&#8217;d was pre-employ&#8217;d by him:</LINE>
<LINE>He has discover&#8217;d my design, and I</LINE>
<LINE>Remain a pinch&#8217;d thing; yea, a very trick</LINE>
<LINE>For them to play at will. How came the posterns</LINE>
<LINE>So easily open?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. LORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">By his great authority,</LINE>
<LINE>Which often hath no less prevail&#8217;d than so</LINE>
<LINE>On your command.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">I know&#8217;t too well.</LINE>
<LINE>Give me the boy. I am glad you did not nurse him.</LINE>
<LINE>Though he does bear some signs of me, yet you</LINE>
<LINE>Have too much blood in him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">What is this? Sport?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Bear the boy hence, he shall not come about her.</LINE>
<LINE>Away with him! And let her sport herself</LINE>
<LINE>With that she&#8217;s big with, for &#8217;tis Polixenes</LINE>
<LINE>Has made thee swell thus.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HER.</SPEAKER>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">You, my lords,</LINE>
<LINE>Look on her, mark her well; be but about</LINE>
<LINE>To say she is a goodly lady, and</LINE>
<LINE>The justice of your hearts will thereto add</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis pity she&#8217;s not honest&#8212;honorable.</LINE>
<LINE>Praise her but for this her without-door form</LINE>
<LINE>(Which on my faith deserves high speech) and straight</LINE>
<LINE>The shrug, the hum or ha (these petty brands</LINE>
<LINE>That calumny doth use&#8212;O, I am out&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>That mercy does, for calumny will sear</LINE>
<LINE>Virtue itself), these shrugs, these hums and ha&#8217;s,</LINE>
<LINE>When you have said she&#8217;s goodly, come between</LINE>
<LINE>Ere you can say she&#8217;s honest: but be&#8217;t known</LINE>
<LINE>(From him that has most cause to grieve it should be)</LINE>
<LINE>She&#8217;s an adult&#8217;ress.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Should a villain say so,</LINE>
<LINE>The most replenish&#8217;d villain in the world,</LINE>
<LINE>He were as much more villain: you, my lord,</LINE>
<LINE>Do but mistake.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="3">You have mistook, my lady,</LINE>
<LINE>Polixenes for Leontes. O thou thing!</LINE>
<LINE>Which I&#8217;ll not call a creature of thy place,</LINE>
<LINE>Lest barbarism (making me the precedent)</LINE>
<LINE>Should a like language use to all degrees,</LINE>
<LINE>And mannerly distinguishment leave out</LINE>
<LINE>Betwixt the prince and beggar. I have said</LINE>
<LINE>She&#8217;s an adult&#8217;ress, I have said with whom:</LINE>
<LINE>More&#8212;she&#8217;s a traitor, and Camillo is</LINE>
<LINE>A federary with her, and one that knows</LINE>
<LINE>What she should shame to know herself,</LINE>
<LINE>But with her most vild principal&#8212;that she&#8217;s</LINE>
<LINE>A bed-swerver, even as bad as those</LINE>
<LINE>That vulgars give bold&#8217;st titles; ay, and privy</LINE>
<LINE>To this their late escape.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">No, by my life,</LINE>
<LINE>Privy to none of this. How will this grieve you,</LINE>
<LINE>When you shall come to clearer knowledge, that</LINE>
<LINE>You thus have publish&#8217;d me! Gentle my lord,</LINE>
<LINE>You scarce can right me throughly, then, to say</LINE>
<LINE>You did mistake.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">No; if I mistake</LINE>
<LINE>In those foundations which I build upon,</LINE>
<LINE>The centre is not big enough to bear</LINE>
<LINE>A schoolboy&#8217;s top. Away with her, to prison!</LINE>
<LINE>He who shall speak for her is afar off guilty</LINE>
<LINE>But that he speaks.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">There&#8217;s some ill planet reigns;</LINE>
<LINE>I must be patient, till the heavens look</LINE>
<LINE>With an aspect more favorable. Good my lords,</LINE>
<LINE>I am not prone to weeping, as our sex</LINE>
<LINE>Commonly are, the want of which vain dew</LINE>
<LINE>Perchance shall dry your pities; but I have</LINE>
<LINE>That honorable grief lodg&#8217;d here which burns</LINE>

<LINE>Who is&#8217;t that goes with me? Beseech your Highness</LINE>
<LINE>My women may be with me, for you see</LINE>
<LINE>My plight requires it. Do not weep, good fools,</LINE>
<LINE>There is no cause. When you shall know your mistress</LINE>
<LINE>Has deserv&#8217;d prison, then abound in tears</LINE>
<LINE>As I come out; this action I now go on</LINE>
<LINE>Is for my better grace. <FRENCH lang="fr">Adieu</FRENCH>, my lord,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is for you we speak, not for ourselves.</LINE>
<LINE>You are abus&#8217;d, and by some putter-on</LINE>
<LINE>That will be damn&#8217;d for&#8217;t. Would I knew the villain,</LINE>
<LINE>I would land-damn him. Be she honor-flaw&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>I have three daughters: the eldest is eleven;</LINE>
<LINE>The second and the third, nine, and some five;</LINE>
<LINE>If this prove true, they&#8217;ll pay for&#8217;t. By mine honor,</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll geld &#8217;em all; fourteen they shall not see</LINE>

<LINE offset="6">Cease, no more.</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. LORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I had rather you did lack than I, my lord,</LINE>

<LINE>Be blam&#8217;d for&#8217;t how you might.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">Why, what need we</LINE>
<LINE>Commune with you of this, but rather follow</LINE>
<LINE>Our forceful instigation? Our prerogative</LINE>
<LINE>Calls not your counsels, but our natural goodness</LINE>
<LINE>Imparts this; which if you&#8212;or stupefied</LINE>
<LINE>Or seeming so in skill&#8212;cannot, or will not,</LINE>
<LINE>Relish a truth like us, inform yourselves</LINE>
<LINE>We need no more of your advice. The matter,</LINE>
<LINE>The loss, the gain, the ord&#8217;ring on&#8217;t, is all</LINE>
<LINE>Properly ours.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="3">And I wish, my liege,</LINE>
<LINE>You had only in your silent judgment tried it,</LINE>
<LINE>Without more overture.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">How could that be?</LINE>
<LINE>Either thou art most ignorant by age,</LINE>
<LINE>Or thou wert born a fool. Camillo&#8217;s flight,</LINE>
<LINE>Added to their familiarity</LINE>
<LINE>(Which was as gross as ever touch&#8217;d conjecture,</LINE>
<LINE>That lack&#8217;d sight only, nought for approbation</LINE>
<LINE>But only seeing, all other circumstances</LINE>
<LINE>Made up to th&#8217; deed), doth push on this proceeding.</LINE>
<LINE>Yet, for a greater confirmation</LINE>
<LINE>(For in an act of this importance &#8217;twere</LINE>
<LINE>Most piteous to be wild), I have dispatch&#8217;d in post</LINE>
<LINE>To sacred Delphos, to Apollo&#8217;s temple,</LINE>
<LINE>Cleomines and Dion, whom you know</LINE>
<LINE>Of stuff&#8217;d sufficiency. Now, from the oracle</LINE>
<LINE>They will bring all, whose spiritual counsel had,</LINE>
<LINE>Shall stop or spur me. Have I done well?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. LORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well done, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Though I am satisfied, and need no more</LINE>
<LINE>Than what I know, yet shall the oracle</LINE>
<LINE>Give rest to th&#8217; minds of others&#8212;such as he,</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Points at Antigonus.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Whose ignorant credulity will not</LINE>
<LINE>Come up to th&#8217; truth. So have we thought it good</LINE>
<LINE>From our free person she should be confin&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Lest that the treachery of the two fled hence</LINE>
<LINE>Be left her to perform. Come follow us,</LINE>
<LINE>We are to speak in public; for this business</LINE>
<LINE>Will raise us all.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>I&#8217;ll show&#8217;t the King, and undertake to be</LINE>

<LINE>Take it on her. Camillo and Polixenes</LINE>
<LINE>Laugh at me; make their pastime at my sorrow:</LINE>
<LINE>They should not laugh if I could reach them, nor</LINE>

<SPEAKER>PAUL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, rather, good my lords, be second to me.</LINE>

<LINE offset="5">Not so hot, good sir,</LINE>
<LINE>I come to bring him sleep. &#8217;Tis such as you,</LINE>
<LINE>That creep like shadows by him, and do sigh</LINE>
<LINE>At each his needless heavings, such as you</LINE>
<LINE>Nourish the cause of his awaking. I</LINE>
<LINE>Do come with words as medicinal as true,</LINE>
<LINE>Honest as either, to purge him of that humor</LINE>
<LINE>That presses him from sleep.</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAUL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No noise, my lord, but needful conference</LINE>
<LINE>About some gossips for your Highness.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="8">How?</LINE>
<LINE>Away with that audacious lady! Antigonus,</LINE>
<LINE>I charg&#8217;d thee that she should not come about me:</LINE>
<LINE>I knew she would.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">I told her so, my lord,</LINE>

<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAUL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Good my liege, I come&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>And I beseech you hear me, who professes</LINE>
<LINE>Myself your loyal servant, your physician,</LINE>
<LINE>Your most obedient counsellor; yet that dares</LINE>
<LINE>Less appear so, in comforting your evils,</LINE>
<LINE>Than such as most seem yours&#8212;I say, I come</LINE>

<LINE>Good queen, my lord, good queen, I say good queen,</LINE>

<LINE offset="6">Force her hence.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAUL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let him that makes but trifles of his eyes</LINE>
<LINE>First hand me. On mine own accord I&#8217;ll off,</LINE>
<LINE>But first I&#8217;ll do my errand. The good queen</LINE>
<LINE>(For she is good) hath brought you forth a daughter&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Here &#8217;tis&#8212;commends it to your blessing.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>PAUL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">Not so.</LINE>
<LINE>I am as ignorant in that, as you</LINE>
<LINE>In so entit&#8217;ling me; and no less honest</LINE>
<LINE>Than you are mad; which is enough, I&#8217;ll warrant</LINE>

<LINE offset="6">Give her the bastard,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou dotard, thou art woman-tir&#8217;d; unroosted</LINE>

<LINE>Commit them to the fire!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAUL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">It is yours:</LINE>
<LINE>And might we lay th&#8217; old proverb to your charge,</LINE>

<LINE>And copy of the father&#8212;eye, nose, lip,</LINE>
<LINE>The trick of &#8217;s frown, his forehead, nay, the valley,</LINE>
<LINE>The pretty dimples of his chin and cheek, his smiles,</LINE>
<LINE>The very mould and frame of hand, nail, finger.</LINE>
<LINE>And thou, good goddess Nature, which hast made it</LINE>
<LINE>So like to him that got it, if thou hast</LINE>
<LINE>The ordering of the mind too, &#8217;mongst all colors</LINE>

<LINE>But this most cruel usage of your queen</LINE>
<LINE>(Not able to produce more accusation</LINE>

<LINE offset="6">On your allegiance,</LINE>

<SPEAKER>PAUL.</SPEAKER>

<LINE>Within this hour bring me word &#8217;tis done</LINE>

<LINE>Death to thyself but to thy lewd-tongu&#8217;d wife,</LINE>
<LINE>Whom for this time we pardon. We enjoin thee,</LINE>
<LINE>As thou art liegeman to us, that thou carry</LINE>
<LINE>This female bastard hence, and that thou bear it</LINE>
<LINE>To some remote and desert place quite out</LINE>
<LINE>Of our dominions, and that there thou leave it</LINE>
<LINE>(Without more mercy) to it own protection,</LINE>
<LINE>And favor of the climate. As by strange fortune</LINE>
<LINE>It came to us, I do in justice charge thee,</LINE>
<LINE>On thy soul&#8217;s peril, and thy body&#8217;s torture,</LINE>
<LINE>That thou commend it strangely to some place</LINE>
<LINE>Where chance may nurse or end it. Take it up.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I swear to do this&#8212;though a present death</LINE>
<LINE>Had been more merciful. Come on, poor babe.</LINE>
<LINE>Some powerful spirit instruct the kites and ravens</LINE>
<LINE>To be thy nurses! Wolves and bears, they say,</LINE>
<LINE>Casting their savageness aside, have done</LINE>
<LINE>Like offices of pity. Sir, be prosperous</LINE>
<LINE>In more than this deed does require! And blessing</LINE>
<LINE>Against this cruelty fight on thy side,</LINE>

<LINE><RECITE>&#8220;Hermione, queen to the worthy Leontes, King of Sicilia, thou art here accused and arraigned of high treason, in committing adultery with Polixenes, King of Bohemia, and conspiring with Camillo to take away the life of our sovereign lord the King, thy royal husband: the pretense whereof being by circumstances partly laid open, thou, Hermione, contrary to the faith and allegiance of a true subject, didst counsel and aid them, for their better safety, to fly away by night.&#8221;</RECITE></LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Since what I am to say must be but that</LINE>
<LINE>Which contradicts my accusation, and</LINE>
<LINE>The testimony on my part no other</LINE>
<LINE>But what comes from myself, it shall scarce boot me</LINE>
<LINE>To say &#8220;Not guilty.&#8221; Mine integrity,</LINE>
<LINE>Being counted falsehood, shall (as I express it)</LINE>
<LINE>Be so receiv&#8217;d. But thus, if pow&#8217;rs divine</LINE>
<LINE>Behold our human actions (as they do),</LINE>
<LINE>I doubt not then but innocence shall make</LINE>
<LINE>False accusation blush, and tyranny</LINE>
<LINE>Tremble at patience. You, my lord, best know</LINE>
<LINE>(Who least will seem to do so) my past life</LINE>
<LINE>Hath been as continent, as chaste, as true,</LINE>
<LINE>As I am now unhappy; which is more</LINE>
<LINE>Than history can pattern, though devis&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>And play&#8217;d to take spectators. For behold me,</LINE>
<LINE>A fellow of the royal bed, which owe</LINE>
<LINE>A moi&#8217;ty of the throne, a great king&#8217;s daughter,</LINE>
<LINE>The mother to a hopeful prince, here standing</LINE>
<LINE>To prate and talk for life and honor &#8217;fore</LINE>
<LINE>Who please to come and hear. For life, I prize it</LINE>
<LINE>As I weigh grief, which I would spare; for honor,</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis a derivative from me to mine,</LINE>
<LINE>And only that I stand for. I appeal</LINE>
<LINE>To your own conscience, sir, before Polixenes</LINE>
<LINE>Came to your court, how I was in your grace,</LINE>
<LINE>How merited to be so; since he came,</LINE>
<LINE>With what encounter so uncurrent I</LINE>
<LINE>Have strain&#8217;d t&#8217; appear thus; if one jot beyond</LINE>
<LINE>The bound of honor, or in act or will</LINE>
<LINE>That way inclining, hard&#8217;ned be the hearts</LINE>

<LINE>I lov&#8217;d him as in honor he requir&#8217;d;</LINE>
<LINE>With such a kind of love as might become</LINE>
<LINE>A lady like me; with a love even such,</LINE>
<LINE>So, and no other, as yourself commanded;</LINE>
<LINE>Which not to have done I think had been in me</LINE>
<LINE>Both disobedience and ingratitude</LINE>
<LINE>To you and toward your friend, whose love had spoke,</LINE>
<LINE>Even since it could speak, from an infant, freely,</LINE>
<LINE>That it was yours. Now for conspiracy,</LINE>
<LINE>I know not how it tastes, though it be dish&#8217;d</LINE>

<SPEAKER>HER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir,</LINE>
<LINE>You speak a language that I understand not.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Your actions are my dreams.</LINE>
<LINE>You had a bastard by Polixenes,</LINE>
<LINE>And I but dream&#8217;d it. As you were past all shame</LINE>
<LINE>(Those of your fact are so), so past all truth;</LINE>
<LINE>Which to deny concerns more than avails; for as</LINE>
<LINE>Thy brat hath been cast out, like to itself,</LINE>
<LINE>No father owning it (which is indeed</LINE>
<LINE>More criminal in thee than it), so thou</LINE>
<LINE>Shall feel our justice; in whose easiest passage</LINE>
<LINE>Look for no less than death.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Sir, spare your threats.</LINE>
<LINE>The bug which you would fright me with, I seek.</LINE>
<LINE>To me can life be no commodity;</LINE>
<LINE>The crown and comfort of my life, your favor,</LINE>
<LINE>I do give lost, for I do feel it gone,</LINE>
<LINE>But know not how it went. My second joy</LINE>
<LINE>And first-fruits of my body, from his presence</LINE>
<LINE>I am barr&#8217;d, like one infectious. My third comfort</LINE>
<LINE>(Starr&#8217;d most unluckily) is from my breast</LINE>
<LINE>(The innocent milk in it most innocent mouth)</LINE>
<LINE>Hal&#8217;d out to murder; myself on every post</LINE>
<LINE>Proclaim&#8217;d a strumpet; with immodest hatred</LINE>
<LINE>The child-bed privilege denied, which &#8217;longs</LINE>
<LINE>To women of all fashion; lastly, hurried</LINE>
<LINE>Here to this place, i&#8217; th&#8217; open air, before</LINE>
<LINE>I have got strength of limit. Now, my liege,</LINE>
<LINE>Tell me what blessings I have here alive,</LINE>
<LINE>That I should fear to die? Therefore proceed.</LINE>
<LINE>But yet hear this&#8212;mistake me not; no life</LINE>
<LINE>(I prize it not a straw), but for mine honor,</LINE>
<LINE>Which I would free&#8212;if I shall be condemn&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>Upon surmises (all proofs sleeping else</LINE>
<LINE>But what your jealousies awake), I tell you</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis rigor and not law. Your honors all,</LINE>

<LINE>But that the good mind of Camillo tardied</LINE>
<LINE>My swift command, though I with death and with</LINE>

<LINE>(Which you knew great), and to the hazard of</LINE>

<LINE>Together working with thy jealousies</LINE>
<LINE>(Fancies too weak for boys, too green and idle</LINE>
<LINE>For girls of nine), O, think what they have done,</LINE>
<LINE>And then run mad indeed&#8212;stark mad! For all</LINE>
<LINE>Thy by-gone fooleries were but spices of it.</LINE>
<LINE>That thou betrayedst Polixenes, &#8217;twas nothing&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>That did but show thee, of a fool, inconstant,</LINE>
<LINE>And damnable ingrateful; nor was&#8217;t much</LINE>
<LINE>Thou wouldst have poison&#8217;d good Camillo&#8217;s honor,</LINE>
<LINE>To have him kill a king&#8212;poor trespasses,</LINE>
<LINE>More monstrous standing by; whereof I reckon</LINE>

<LINE>Do not repent these things, for they are heavier</LINE>

<LINE>To nothing but despair. A thousand knees,</LINE>
<LINE>Ten thousand years together, naked, fasting,</LINE>

<SPEAKER>PAUL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">I am sorry for&#8217;t.</LINE>
<LINE>All faults I make, when I shall come to know them,</LINE>

<LINE>The rashness of a woman; he is touch&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>To th&#8217; noble heart. What&#8217;s gone and what&#8217;s past help</LINE>

<LINE>At my petition; I beseech you, rather</LINE>
<LINE>Let me be punish&#8217;d, that have minded you</LINE>

<LINE>Sir, royal sir, forgive a foolish woman.</LINE>
<LINE>The love I bore your queen&#8212;lo, fool again!&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll speak of her no more, nor of your children;</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll not remember you of my own lord,</LINE>
<LINE>Who is lost too. Take your patience to you,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Thou didst speak but well</LINE>
<LINE>When most the truth; which I receive much better</LINE>
<LINE>Than to be pitied of thee. Prithee bring me</LINE>
<LINE>To the dead bodies of my queen and son.</LINE>
<LINE>One grave shall be for both; upon them shall</LINE>
<LINE>The causes of their death appear (unto</LINE>
<LINE>Our shame perpetual). Once a day I&#8217;ll visit</LINE>
<LINE>The chapel where they lie, and tears shed there</LINE>
<LINE>Shall be my recreation. So long as nature</LINE>
<LINE>Will bear up with this exercise, so long</LINE>
<LINE>I daily vow to use it. Come, and lead me</LINE>
<LINE>To these sorrows.</LINE>

<LINE>So like a waking. To me comes a creature,</LINE>
<LINE>Sometimes her head on one side, some another&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>I never saw a vessel of like sorrow,</LINE>
<LINE>So fill&#8217;d, and so becoming; in pure white robes,</LINE>
<LINE>Like very sanctity, she did approach</LINE>
<LINE>My cabin where I lay; thrice bow&#8217;d before me,</LINE>
<LINE>And (gasping to begin some speech) her eyes</LINE>
<LINE>Became two spouts; the fury spent, anon</LINE>
<LINE>Did this break from her: &#8220;Good Antigonus,</LINE>
<LINE>Since fate (against thy better disposition)</LINE>
<LINE>Hath made thy person for the thrower-out</LINE>

<LINE>Thy wife Paulina more.&#8221; And so, with shrieks,</LINE>
<LINE>She melted into air. Affrighted much,</LINE>
<LINE>I did in time collect myself and thought</LINE>
<LINE>This was so, and no slumber. Dreams are toys,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet for this once, yea, superstitiously,</LINE>
<LINE>I will be squar&#8217;d by this. I do believe</LINE>
<LINE>Hermione hath suffer&#8217;d death, and that</LINE>
<LINE>Apollo would (this being indeed the issue</LINE>

Good luck, and&#8217;t be thy will! What have we here? Mercy on &#8217;s, a barne? A very pretty barne! A boy, or a child, I wonder? A pretty one, a very pretty one: sure some scape. Though I am not bookish, yet I can read waiting-gentlewoman in the scape. This has been some stair-work, some trunk-work, some behind-door-work. They were warmer that got this than the poor thing is here. I&#8217;ll take it up for pity, yet I&#8217;ll tarry till my son come; he hallow&#8217;d but even now. Whoa-ho-hoa!</LINE>

<LINE>I would you did but see how it chafes, how it rages, how it takes up the shore! But that&#8217;s not to the point. O, the most piteous cry of the poor souls! Sometimes to see &#8217;em, and not to see &#8217;em; now the ship boring the moon with her mainmast, and anon swallow&#8217;d with yeast and froth, as you&#8217;ld thrust a cork into a hogshead. And then for the land-service, to see how the bear tore out his shoulder-bone, how he cried to me for help, and said his name was Antigonus, a nobleman. But to make an end of the ship, to see how the sea flap-dragon&#8217;d it; but, first, how the poor souls roar&#8217;d, and the sea mock&#8217;d them; and how the poor gentleman roar&#8217;d, and the bear mock&#8217;d him, both roaring louder than the sea or weather.</LINE>

<LINE>Heavy matters, heavy matters! But look thee here, boy. Now bless thyself: thou met&#8217;st with things dying, I with things new-born.

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I pray thee, good Camillo, be no more importunate. &#8217;Tis a sickness denying thee any thing; a death to grant this.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is fifteen years since I saw my country; though I have for the most part been air&#8217;d abroad, I desire to lay my bones there. Besides, the penitent King, my master, hath sent for me, to whose feeling sorrows I might be some allay (or I o&#8217;erween to think so), which is another spur to my departure.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As thou lov&#8217;st me, Camillo, wipe not out the rest of thy services by leaving me now. The need I have of thee, thine own goodness hath made. Better not to have had thee than thus to want thee. Thou, having made me businesses which none without thee can sufficiently manage, must either stay to execute them thyself, or take away with thee the very services thou hast done; which if I have not enough consider&#8217;d (as too much I cannot), to be more thankful to thee shall be my study, and my profit therein the heaping friendships. Of that fatal country Sicilia, prithee speak no more, whose very naming punishes me with the remembrance of that penitent (as thou call&#8217;st him) and reconcil&#8217;d king, my brother, whose loss of his most precious queen and children are even now to be afresh lamented. Say to me, when saw&#8217;st thou the Prince Florizel, my son? Kings are no less unhappy, their issue not being gracious, than they are in losing them when they have approv&#8217;d their virtues.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, it is three days since I saw the Prince. What his happier affairs may be, are to me unknown; but I have (missingly) noted, he is of late much retir&#8217;d from court, and is less frequent to his princely exercises than formerly he hath appear&#8217;d.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have consider&#8217;d so much, Camillo, and with some care, so far that I have eyes under my service which look upon his removedness; from whom I have this intelligence, that he is seldom from the house of a most homely shepherd, a man, they say, that from very nothing, and beyond the imagination of his neighbors, is grown into an unspeakable estate.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have heard, sir, of such a man, who hath a daughter of most rare note. The report of her is extended more than can be thought to begin from such a cottage.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That&#8217;s likewise part of my intelligence; but (I fear) the angle that plucks our son thither. Thou shalt accompany us to the place, where we will (not appearing what we are) have some question with the shepherd; from whose simplicity I think it not uneasy to get the cause of my son&#8217;s resort thither. Prithee be my present partner in this business, and lay aside the thoughts of Sicilia.</LINE>

<LINE>My traffic is sheets; when the kite builds, look to lesser linen. My father nam&#8217;d me Autolycus, who being, as I am, litter&#8217;d under Mercury, was likewise a snapper-up of unconsider&#8217;d trifles. With die and drab I purchas&#8217;d this caparison, and my revenue is the silly cheat. Gallows and knock are too powerful on the highway. Beating and hanging are terrors to me.

Three pound of sugar, five pound of currants, rice&#8212;what will this sister of mine do with rice? But my father hath made her mistress of the feast, and she lays it on. She hath made me four and twenty nosegays for the shearers (three-man song-men all, and very good ones), but they are most of them means and bases; but one Puritan amongst them, and he sings psalms to horn-pipes. I must have saffron to color the warden pies; mace; dates, none&#8212;that&#8217;s out of my note; nut-megs, seven; a race or two of ginger, but that I may beg; four pounds of pruins, and as many of raisins o&#8217; th&#8217; sun.</LINE>

<LINE>A fellow, sir, that I have known to go about with troll-my-dames. I knew him once a servant of the Prince. I cannot tell, good sir, for which of his virtues it was, but he was certainly whipt out of the court.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>His vices, you would say; there&#8217;s no virtue whipt out of the court. They cherish it to make it stay there; and yet it will no more but abide.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Vices, I would say, sir. I know this man well; he hath been since an ape-bearer, then a process-server, a bailiff, then he compass&#8217;d a motion of the Prodigal Son, and married a tinker&#8217;s wife within a mile where my land and living lies; and, having flown over many knavish professions, he settled only in rogue. Some call him Autolycus.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Out upon him! Prig, for my life, prig! He haunts wakes, fairs, and bear-baitings.</LINE>

<LINE>Very true, sir; he, sir, he. That&#8217;s the rogue that put me into this apparel.</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SERV. OLD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O master! If you did but hear the pedlar at the door, you would never dance again after a tabor and pipe; no, the bagpipe could not move you. He sings several tunes faster than You&#8217;ll tell money; he utters them as he had eaten ballads and all men&#8217;s ears grew to his tunes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He could never come better; he shall come in. I love a ballad but even too well, if it be doleful matter merrily set down, or a very pleasant thing indeed and sung lamentably.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SERV. OLD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He hath songs for man or woman, of all sizes; no milliner can so fit his customers with gloves. He has the prettiest love-songs for maids, so without bawdry, which is strange; with such delicate burdens of dildos and fadings, &#8220;jump her and thump her&#8221;; and where some stretch-mouth&#8217;d rascal would (as it were) mean mischief, and break a foul gap into the matter, he makes the maid to answer, &#8220;Whoop, do me no harm, good man&#8221;&#8212;puts him off, slights him, with &#8220;Whoop, do me no harm, good man.&#8221;</LINE>

<LINE>He hath ribbons of all the colors i&#8217; th&#8217; rainbow; points more than all the lawyers in Bohemia can learnedly handle, though they come to him by th&#8217; gross; inkles, caddises, cambrics, lawns. Why, he sings &#8217;em over as they were gods or goddesses: you would think a smock were a she-angel, he so chants to the sleeve-hand and the work about the square on&#8217;t.</LINE>

<LINE>Ha, ha, what a fool Honesty is! And Trust, his sworn brother, a very simple gentleman! I have sold all my trompery; not a counterfeit stone, not a ribbon, glass, pomander, brooch, table-book, ballad, knife, tape, glove, shoe-tie, bracelet, horn-ring, to keep my pack from fasting. They throng who should buy first, as if my trinkets had been hallow&#8217;d and brought a benediction to the buyer; by which means I saw whose purse was best in picture, and what I saw, to my good use I rememb&#8217;red. My clown (who wants but something to be a reasonable man) grew so in love with the wenches&#8217; song, that he would not stir his pettitoes till he had both tune and words, which so drew the rest of the herd to me that all their other senses stuck in ears. You might have pinch&#8217;d a placket, it was senseless; &#8217;twas nothing to geld a codpiece of a purse; I would have fil&#8217;d keys off that hung in chains. No hearing, no feeling, but my sir&#8217;s song, and admiring the not hing of it. So that in this time of lethargy I pick&#8217;d and cut most of their festival purses; and had not the old man come in with a whoobub against his daughter and the King&#8217;s son, and scar&#8217;d my choughs from the chaff, I had not left a purse alive in the whole army.</LINE>

<LINE>I understand the business, I hear it.

I see this is the time that the unjust man doth thrive. What an exchange had this been, without boot! What a boot is here, with this exchange! Sure the gods do this year connive at us, and we may do any thing extempore. The Prince himself is about a piece of iniquity: stealing away from his father with his clog at his heels. If I thought it were a piece of honesty to acquaint the King withal, I would not do&#8217;t. I hold it the more knavery to conceal it; and therein am I constant to my profession.</LINE>

<LINE>Though I am not naturally honest, I am so sometimes by chance. Let me pocket up my pedlar&#8217;s excrement. <STAGEDIR>Takes off his false beard.</STAGEDIR> How now, rustics, whither are you bound?</LINE>

<LINE>Your affairs there? What? With whom? The condition of that fardel? The place of your dwelling? Your names? Your ages? Of what having? Breeding? And any thing that is fitting to be known&#8212;discover.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We are but plain fellows, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A lie; you are rough and hairy. Let me have no lying. It becomes none but tradesmen, and they often give us soldiers the lie, but we pay them for it with stamped coin, not stabbing steel, therefore they do not give us the lie.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your worship had like to have given us one, if you had not taken yourself with the manner.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SHEP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Are you a courtier, and&#8217;t like you, sir?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Whether it like me or no, I am a courtier. Seest thou not the air of the court in these enfoldings? Hath not my gait in it the measure of the court? Receives not thy nose court-odor from me? Reflect I not on thy baseness court-contempt? Think&#8217;st thou, for that I insinuate, that toze from thee thy business, I am therefore no courtier? I am courtier cap-a-pe, and one that will either push on or pluck back thy business there; whereupon I command thee to open thy affair.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SHEP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My business, sir, is to the King.</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>What advocate hast thou to him?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SHEP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know not, and&#8217;t like you.</LINE>

<LINE>Advocate&#8217;s the court-word for a pheasant. Say you have none.</LINE>

<LINE>None, sir; I have no pheasant cock, nor hen.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How blessed are we that are not simple men!</LINE>
<LINE>Yet nature might have made me as these are,</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore I will not disdain.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This cannot be but a great courtier.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SHEP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>His garments are rich, but he wears them not handsomely.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He seems to be the more noble in being fantastical. A great man, I&#8217;ll warrant; I know by the picking on &#8217;s teeth.</LINE>

<LINE>The fardel there? What&#8217;s i&#8217; th&#8217; fardel? Wherefore that box?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SHEP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, there lies such secrets in this fardel and box, which none must know but the King, and which he shall know within this hour, if I may come to th&#8217; speech of him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Age, thou hast lost thy labor.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SHEP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, sir?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The King is not at the palace. He is gone aboard a new ship to purge melancholy and air himself; for if thou be&#8217;st capable of things serious, thou must know the King is full of grief.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SHEP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So &#8217;tis said, sir&#8212;about his son, that should have married a shepherd&#8217;s daughter.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If that shepherd be not in hand-fast, let him fly. The curses he shall have, the tortures he shall feel, will break the back of man, the heart of monster.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Think you so, sir?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not he alone shall suffer what wit can make heavy and vengeance bitter; but those that are germane to him (though remov&#8217;d fifty times) shall all come under the hangman; which though it be great pity, yet it is necessary. An old sheep-whistling rogue, a ram-tender, to offer to have his daughter come into grace! Some say he shall be ston&#8217;d; but that death is too soft for him, say I. Draw our throne into a sheep-cote!&#8212;all deaths are too few, the sharpest too easy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Has the old man e&#8217;er a son, sir, do you hear, and&#8217;t like you, sir?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He has a son, who shall be flay&#8217;d alive; then &#8217;nointed over with honey, set on the head of a wasp&#8217;s nest; then stand till he be three quarters and a dram dead; then recover&#8217;d again with aqua-vitae or some other hot infusion; then, raw as he is (and in the hottest day prognostication proclaims), shall he be set against a brick-wall, the sun looking with a southward eye upon him, where he is to behold him with flies blown to death. But what talk we of these traitorly rascals, whose miseries are to be smil&#8217;d at, their offenses being so capital? Tell me (for you seem to be honest plain men) what you have to the King. Being something gently consider&#8217;d, I&#8217;ll bring you where he is aboard, tender your persons to his presence, whisper him in your behalfs; and if it be in man besides the King to effect your suits, here is man shall do it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He seems to be of great authority. Close with him, give him gold; and though authority be a stubborn bear, yet he is oft led by the nose with gold. Show the inside of your purse to the outside of his hand, and no more ado. Remember &#8220;ston&#8217;d,&#8221; and &#8220;flay&#8217;d alive.&#8221;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SHEP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And&#8217;t please you, sir, to undertake the business for us, here is that gold I have. I&#8217;ll make it as much more, and leave this young man in pawn till I bring it you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>After I have done what I promis&#8217;d?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SHEP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, give me the moi&#8217;ty. Are you a party in this business?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In some sort, sir; but though my case be a pitiful one, I hope I shall not be flay&#8217;d out of it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, that&#8217;s the case of the shepherd&#8217;s son. Hang him, he&#8217;ll be made an example.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Comfort, good comfort! We must to the King, and show our strange sights. He must know &#8217;tis none of your daughter, nor my sister; we are gone else. Sir, I will give you as much as this old man does when the business is perform&#8217;d, and remain (as he says) your pawn till it be brought you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will trust you. Walk before toward the sea-side, go on the right hand, I will but look upon the hedge, and follow you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We are bless&#8217;d in this man, as I may say, even bless&#8217;d.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt Shepherd and Clown.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If I had a mind to be honest, I see Fortune would not suffer me: she drops booties in my mouth. I am courted now with a double occasion: gold and a means to do the Prince my master good; which who knows how that may turn back to my advancement? I will bring these two moles, these blind ones, aboard him. If he think it fit to shore them again, and that the complaint they have to the King concerns him nothing, let him call me rogue for being so far officious, for I am proof against that title, and what shame else belongs to&#8217;t. To him will I present them, there may be matter in it.</LINE>

<SCENEPERSONAE>(Autolycus, Gentlemen, Shepherd, Clown)</SCENEPERSONAE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Autolycus and a Gentleman.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Beseech you, sir, were you present at this relation?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. GENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I was by at the opening of the fardel, heard the old shepherd deliver the manner how he found it; whereupon, after a little amazedness, we were all commanded out of the chamber; only this, methought, I heard the shepherd say, he found the child.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would most gladly know the issue of it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. GENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I make a broken delivery of the business; but the changes I perceiv&#8217;d in the King and Camillo were very notes of admiration. They seem&#8217;d almost, with staring on one another, to tear the cases of their eyes. There was speech in their dumbness, language in their very gesture; they look&#8217;d as they had heard of a world ransom&#8217;d, or one destroy&#8217;d. A notable passion of wonder appear&#8217;d in them; but the wisest beholder, that knew no more but seeing, could not say if th&#8217; importance were joy or sorrow; but in the extremity of the one, it must needs be.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter another Gentleman.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Here comes a gentleman that haply knows more. The news, Rogero?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. GENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nothing but bonfires. The oracle is fulfill&#8217;d; the King&#8217;s daughter is found. Such a deal of wonder is broken out within this hour that ballad-makers cannot be able to express it.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter another Gentleman.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Here comes the Lady Paulina&#8217;s steward, he can deliver you more. How goes it now, sir? This news, which is call&#8217;d true, is so like an old tale, that the verity of it is in strong suspicion. Has the King found his heir?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>3. GENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Most true, if ever truth were pregnant by circumstance. That which you hear You&#8217;ll swear you see, there is such unity in the proofs. The mantle of Queen Hermione&#8217;s; her jewel about the neck of it; the letters of Antigonus found with it, which they know to be his character; the majesty of the creature in resemblance of the mother; the affection of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding; and many other evidences proclaim her, with all certainty, to be the King&#8217;s daughter. Did you see the meeting of the two kings?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. GENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>3. GENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then have you lost a sight which was to be seen, cannot be spoken of. There might you have beheld one joy crown another, so and in such manner that it seem&#8217;d sorrow wept to take leave of them, for their joy waded in tears. There was casting up of eyes, holding up of hands, with countenance of such distraction that they were to be known by garment, not by favor. Our king, being ready to leap out of himself for joy of his found daughter, as if that joy were now become a loss, cries, &#8220;O, thy mother, thy mother!&#8221;; then asks Bohemia forgiveness; then embraces his son-in-law; then again worries he his daughter with clipping her. Now he thanks the old shepherd, which stands by like a weather-bitten conduit of many kings&#8217; reigns. I never heard of such another encounter, which lames report to follow it, and undoes description to do it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. GENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, pray you, became of Antigonus, that carried hence the child?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>3. GENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Like an old tale still, which will have matter to rehearse, though credit be asleep and not an ear open: he was torn to pieces with a bear. This avouches the shepherd&#8217;s son, who has not only his innocence (which seems much) to justify him, but a handkerchief and rings of his that Paulina knows.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. GENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What became of his bark and his followers?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>3. GENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Wrack&#8217;d the same instant of their master&#8217;s death, and in the view of the shepherd; so that all the instruments which aided to expose the child were even then lost when it was found. But O, the noble combat that &#8217;twixt joy and sorrow was fought in Paulina! She had one eye declin&#8217;d for the loss of her husband, another elevated that the oracle was fulfill&#8217;d. She lifted the Princess from the earth, and so locks her in embracing, as if she would pin her to her heart, that she might no more be in danger of losing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. GENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The dignity of this act was worth the audience of kings and princes, for by such was it acted.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>3. GENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>One of the prettiest touches of all, and that which angled for mine eyes (caught the water though not the fish), was when, at the relation of the Queen&#8217;s death (with the manner how she came to&#8217;t bravely confess&#8217;d and lamented by the King), how attentiveness wounded his daughter, till (from one sign of dolor to another) she did (with an &#8220;Alas!&#8221;), I would fain say, bleed tears; for I am sure my heart wept blood. Who was most marble there chang&#8217;d color; some swounded, all sorrow&#8217;d. If all the world could have seen&#8217;t, the woe had been universal.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. GENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Are they return&#8217;d to the court?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>3. GENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No. The Princess hearing of her mother&#8217;s statue, which is in the keeping of Paulina&#8212;a piece many years in doing and now newly perform&#8217;d by that rare Italian master, Julio Romano, who, had he himself eternity and could put breath into his work, would beguile Nature of her custom, so perfectly he is her ape. He so near to Hermione hath done Hermione that they say one would speak to her and stand in hope of answer. Thither with all greediness of affection are they gone, and there they intend to sup.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. GENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I thought she had some great matter there in hand, for she hath privately twice or thrice a day, ever since the death of Hermione, visited that remov&#8217;d house. Shall we thither, and with our company piece the rejoicing?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. GENT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who would be thence that has the benefit of access? Every wink of an eye some new grace will be born. Our absence makes us unthrifty to our knowledge. Let&#8217;s along.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt Gentlemen.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, had I not the dash of my former life in me, would preferment drop on my head. I brought the old man and his son aboard the Prince; told him I heard them talk of a fardel, and I know not what; but he at that time, overfond of the shepherd&#8217;s daughter (so he then took her to be), who began to be much sea-sick, and himself little better, extremity of weather continuing, this mystery remain&#8217;d undiscover&#8217;d. But &#8217;tis all one to me; for had I been the finder-out of this secret, it would not have relish&#8217;d among my other discredits.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Shepherd and Clown.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Here come those I have done good to against my will, and already appearing in the blossoms of their fortune.</LINE>

<LINE>Come, boy, I am past more children, but thy sons and daughters will be all gentlemen born.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You are well met, sir. You denied to fight with me this other day, because I was no gentleman born. See you these clothes? Say you see them not and think me still no gentleman born. You were best say these robes are not gentlemen born. Give me the lie, do; and try whether I am not now a gentleman born.</LINE>

<LINE>I know you are now, sir, a gentleman born.</LINE>

<LINE>And so have I, boy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So you have. But I was a gentleman born before my father; for the King&#8217;s son took me by the hand, and call&#8217;d me brother; and then the two kings call&#8217;d my father brother; and then the Prince, my brother, and the Princess, my sister, call&#8217;d my father father; and so we wept; and there was the first gentleman-like tears that ever we shed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SHEP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We may live, son, to shed many more.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay; or else &#8217;twere hard luck, being in so preposterous estate as we are.</LINE>

<LINE>I humbly beseech you, sir, to pardon me all the faults I have committed to your worship, and to give me your good report to the Prince my master.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SHEP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Prithee, son, do; for we must be gentle, now we are gentlemen.</LINE>

<LINE>Thou wilt amend thy life?</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Ay, and it like your good worship.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Give me thy hand: I will swear to the Prince thou art as honest a true fellow as any is in Bohemia.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SHEP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You may say it, but not swear it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not swear it, now I am a gentleman? Let boors and franklins say it, I&#8217;ll swear it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SHEP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How if it be false, son?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If it be ne&#8217;er so false, a true gentleman may swear it in the behalf of his friend; and I&#8217;ll swear to the Prince thou art a tall fellow of thy hands, and that thou wilt not be drunk; but I know thou art no tall fellow of thy hands, and that thou wilt be drunk; but I&#8217;ll swear it, and I would thou wouldst be a tall fellow of thy hands.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will prove so, sir, to my power.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLO.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, by any means prove a tall fellow. If I do not wonder how thou dar&#8217;st venture to be drunk, not being a tall fellow, trust me not. Hark, the kings and the princes, our kindred, are going to see the Queen&#8217;s picture. Come, follow us; we&#8217;ll be thy good masters.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No! Not these twenty years.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">So long could I</LINE>
<LINE>Stand by, a looker-on.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAUL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Either forbear,</LINE>
<LINE>Quit presently the chapel, or resolve you</LINE>
<LINE>For more amazement. If you can behold it,</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll make the statue move indeed, descend,</LINE>
<LINE>And take you by the hand; but then You&#8217;ll think</LINE>
<LINE>(Which I protest against) I am assisted</LINE>
<LINE>By wicked powers.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">What you can make her do,</LINE>
<LINE>I am content to look on; what to speak,</LINE>
<LINE>I am content to hear; for &#8217;tis as easy</LINE>
<LINE>To make her speak as move.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAUL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">It is requir&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>You do awake your faith. Then, all stand still.</LINE>
<LINE>On; those that think it is unlawful business</LINE>
<LINE>I am about, let them depart.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Proceed;</LINE>
<LINE>No foot shall stir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAUL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Music! Awake her! Strike!</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Music.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis time; descend; be stone no more; approach;</LINE>
<LINE>Strike all that look upon with marvel. Come;</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll fill your grave up. Stir; nay, come away;</LINE>
<LINE>Bequeath to death your numbness; for from him</LINE>
<LINE>Dear life redeems you. You perceive she stirs.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Hermione comes down.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Start not; her actions shall be holy, as</LINE>
<LINE>You hear my spell is lawful. Do not shun her</LINE>
<LINE>Until you see her die again, for then</LINE>
<LINE>You kill her double. Nay, present your hand.</LINE>
<LINE>When she was young, you woo&#8217;d her; now, in age,</LINE>
<LINE>Is she become the suitor?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">O, she&#8217;s warm!</LINE>
<LINE>If this be magic, let it be an art</LINE>
<LINE>Lawful as eating.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">She embraces him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She hangs about his neck.</LINE>
<LINE>If she pertain to life let her speak too.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>POL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, and make it manifest where she has liv&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Or how stol&#8217;n from the dead.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAUL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">That she is living,</LINE>
<LINE>Were it but told you, should be hooted at</LINE>
<LINE>Like an old tale; but it appears she lives,</LINE>
<LINE>Though yet she speak not. Mark a little while.</LINE>
<LINE>Please you to interpose, fair madam, kneel,</LINE>
<LINE>And pray your mother&#8217;s blessing. Turn, good lady,</LINE>
<LINE>Our Perdita is found.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HER.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">You gods, look down</LINE>
<LINE>And from your sacred vials pour your graces</LINE>
<LINE>Upon my daughter&#8217;s head! Tell me, mine own,</LINE>
<LINE>Where hast thou been preserv&#8217;d? Where liv&#8217;d? How found</LINE>
<LINE>Thy father&#8217;s court? For thou shalt hear that I,</LINE>
<LINE>Knowing by Paulina that the oracle</LINE>
<LINE>Gave hope thou wast in being, have preserv&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>Myself to see the issue.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAUL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">There&#8217;s time enough for that;</LINE>
<LINE>Least they desire (upon this push) to trouble</LINE>
<LINE>Your joys with like relation. Go together,</LINE>
<LINE>You precious winners all; your exultation</LINE>
<LINE>Partake to every one. I, an old turtle,</LINE>
<LINE>Will wing me to some wither&#8217;d bough, and there</LINE>
<LINE>My mate (that&#8217;s never to be found again)</LINE>
<LINE>Lament till I am lost.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">O, peace, Paulina!</LINE>
<LINE>Thou shouldst a husband take by my consent,</LINE>
<LINE>As I by thine a wife: this is a match,</LINE>
<LINE>And made between &#8217;s by vows. Thou hast found mine,</LINE>
<LINE>But how, is to be question&#8217;d; for I saw her</LINE>
<LINE>(As I thought) dead; and have (in vain) said many</LINE>
<LINE>A prayer upon her grave. I&#8217;ll not seek far</LINE>
<LINE>(For him, I partly know his mind) to find thee</LINE>
<LINE>An honorable husband. Come, Camillo,</LINE>
<LINE>And take her by the hand, whose worth and honesty</LINE>
<LINE>Is richly noted; and here justified</LINE>
<LINE>By us, a pair of kings. Let&#8217;s from this place.</LINE>
<LINE>What? Look upon my brother. Both your pardons,</LINE>
<LINE>That e&#8217;er I put between your holy looks</LINE>
<LINE>My ill suspicion. This&#8217; your son-in-law,</LINE>
<LINE>And son unto the King, whom heavens directing</LINE>
<LINE>Is troth-plight to your daughter. Good Paulina,</LINE>
<LINE>Lead us from hence, where we may leisurely</LINE>
<LINE>Each one demand, and answer to his part</LINE>
<LINE>Perform&#8217;d in this wide gap of time, since first</LINE>
<LINE>We were dissever&#8217;d. Hastily lead away.</LINE>
</SPEECH>
