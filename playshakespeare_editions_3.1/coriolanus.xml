<SCENEPERSONAE>(Citizens, Menenius Agrippa, Caius Martius, Messenger, Sicinius Velutus, Junius Brutus, Cominius, Titus Lartius, Senators)</SCENEPERSONAE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter a company of mutinous Citizens with staves, clubs, and other weapons.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. CIT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Before we proceed any further, hear me speak.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Speak, speak.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. CIT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You are all resolv&#8217;d rather to die than to famish?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Resolv&#8217;d, resolv&#8217;d.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. CIT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>First, you know Caius Martius is chief enemy to the people.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We know&#8217;t, we know&#8217;t.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. CIT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let us kill him, and we&#8217;ll have corn at our own price. Is&#8217;t a verdict?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No more talking on&#8217;t; let it be done. Away, away!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. CIT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>One word, good citizens.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. CIT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We are accounted poor citizens, the patricians good. What authority surfeits on would relieve us. If they would yield us but the superfluity while it were wholesome, we might guess they reliev&#8217;d us humanely; but they think we are too dear. The leanness that afflicts us, the object of our misery, is as an inventory to particularize their abundance; our sufferance is a gain to them. Let us revenge this with our pikes, ere we become rakes; for the gods know I speak this in hunger for bread, not in thirst for revenge.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. CIT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Would you proceed especially against Caius Martius?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. CIT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Against him first; he&#8217;s a very dog to the commonalty.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. CIT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Consider you what services he has done for his country?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. CIT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Very well, and could be content to give him good report for&#8217;t, but that he pays himself with being proud.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. CIT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, but speak not maliciously.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. CIT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I say unto you, what he hath done famously, he did it to that end. Though soft-conscienc&#8217;d men can be content to say it was for his country, he did it to please his mother, and to be partly proud, which he is, even to the altitude of his virtue.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. CIT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What he cannot help in his nature, you account a vice in him. You must in no way say he is covetous.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. CIT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If I must not, I need not be barren of accusations; he hath faults (with surplus) to tire in repetition.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Shouts within.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>What shouts are these? The other side a&#8217; th&#8217; city is risen; why stay we prating here? To th&#8217; Capitol!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, come.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. CIT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Soft, who comes here?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Menenius Agrippa.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. CIT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Worthy Menenius Agrippa, one that hath always lov&#8217;d the people.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. CIT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He&#8217;s one honest enough; would all the rest were so!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What work&#8217;s, my countrymen, in hand? Where go you</LINE>
<LINE>With bats and clubs? The matter? Speak, I pray you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. CIT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Our business is not unknown to th&#8217; Senate; they have had inkling this fortnight what we intend to do, which now we&#8217;ll show &#8217;em in deeds. They say poor suitors have strong breaths; they shall know we have strong arms too.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, masters, my good friends, mine honest neighbors,</LINE>
<LINE>Will you undo yourselves?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. CIT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We cannot, sir, we are undone already.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I tell you, friends, most charitable care</LINE>
<LINE>Have the patricians of you. For your wants,</LINE>
<LINE>Your suffering in this dearth, you may as well</LINE>
<LINE>Strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them</LINE>
<LINE>Against the Roman state, whose course will on</LINE>
<LINE>The way it takes, cracking ten thousand curbs</LINE>
<LINE>Of more strong link asunder than can ever</LINE>
<LINE>Appear in your impediment. For the dearth,</LINE>
<LINE>The gods, not the patricians, make it, and</LINE>
<LINE>Your knees to them (not arms) must help. Alack,</LINE>
<LINE>You are transported by calamity</LINE>
<LINE>Thither where more attends you, and you slander</LINE>
<LINE>The helms o&#8217; th&#8217; state, who care for you like fathers,</LINE>
<LINE>When you curse them as enemies.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. CIT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Care for us? True indeed! They ne&#8217;er car&#8217;d for us yet. Suffer us to famish, and their store-houses cramm&#8217;d with grain; make edicts for usury, to support usurers; repeal daily any wholesome act establish&#8217;d against the rich, and provide more piercing statutes daily to chain up and restrain the poor. If the wars eat us not up, they will; and there&#8217;s all the love they bear us.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Either you must</LINE>
<LINE>Confess yourselves wondrous malicious,</LINE>
<LINE>Or be accus&#8217;d of folly. I shall tell you</LINE>
<LINE>A pretty tale. It may be you have heard it,</LINE>
<LINE>But, since it serves my purpose, I will venture</LINE>
<LINE>To stale &#8217;t a little more.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. CIT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, I&#8217;ll hear it, sir; yet you must not think to fob off our disgrace with a tale. But and&#8217;t please you, deliver.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There was a time when all the body&#8217;s members</LINE>
<LINE>Rebell&#8217;d against the belly; thus accus&#8217;d it:</LINE>
<LINE>That only like a gulf it did remain</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217; th&#8217; midst a&#8217; th&#8217; body, idle and unactive,</LINE>
<LINE>Still cupboarding the viand, never bearing</LINE>
<LINE>Like labor with the rest, where th&#8217; other instruments</LINE>
<LINE>Did see and hear, devise, instruct, walk, feel,</LINE>
<LINE>And, mutually participate, did minister</LINE>
<LINE>Unto the appetite and affection common</LINE>
<LINE>Of the whole body. The belly answer&#8217;d—</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. CIT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, sir, what answer made the belly?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, I shall tell you. With a kind of smile,</LINE>
<LINE>Which ne&#8217;er came from the lungs, but even thus—</LINE>
<LINE>For, look you, I may make the belly smile</LINE>
<LINE>As well as speak—it tauntingly replied</LINE>
<LINE>To th&#8217; discontented members, the mutinous parts</LINE>
<LINE>That envied his receipt; even so most fitly</LINE>
<LINE>As you malign our senators for that</LINE>
<LINE>They are not such as you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. CIT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Your belly&#8217;s answer—what?</LINE>
<LINE>The kingly-crowned head, the vigilant eye,</LINE>
<LINE>The counsellor heart, the arm our soldier,</LINE>
<LINE>Our steed the leg, the tongue our trumpeter,</LINE>
<LINE>With other muniments and petty helps</LINE>
<LINE>In this our fabric, if that they—</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">What then?</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Fore me, this fellow speaks! What then? What then?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. CIT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Should by the cormorant belly be restrain&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Who is the sink a&#8217; th&#8217; body—</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">Well, what then?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. CIT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The former agents, if they did complain,</LINE>
<LINE>What could the belly answer?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">I will tell you;</LINE>
<LINE>If You&#8217;ll bestow a small (of what you have little)</LINE>
<LINE>Patience awhile, you&#8217;st hear the belly&#8217;s answer.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. CIT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Y&#8217; are long about it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Note me this, good friend:</LINE>
<LINE>Your most grave belly was deliberate,</LINE>
<LINE>Not rash like his accusers, and thus answered:</LINE>
<LINE>&#8220;True is it, my incorporate friends,&#8221; quoth he,</LINE>
<LINE>&#8220;That I receive the general food at first</LINE>
<LINE>Which you do live upon; and fit it is,</LINE>
<LINE>Because I am the store-house and the shop</LINE>
<LINE>Of the whole body. But, if you do remember,</LINE>
<LINE>I send it through the rivers of your blood,</LINE>
<LINE>Even to the court, the heart, to th&#8217; seat o&#8217; th&#8217; brain,</LINE>
<LINE>And, through the cranks and offices of man,</LINE>
<LINE>The strongest nerves and small inferior veins</LINE>
<LINE>From me receive that natural competency</LINE>
<LINE>Whereby they live. And though that all at once&#8221;&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>You, my good friends, this says the belly, mark me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. CIT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, sir, well, well.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">&#8220;Though all at once cannot</LINE>
<LINE>See what I do deliver out to each,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet I can make my audit up, that all</LINE>
<LINE>From me do back receive the flour of all,</LINE>
<LINE>And leave me but the bran.&#8221; What say you to&#8217;t?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. CIT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It was an answer. How apply you this?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The senators of Rome are this good belly,</LINE>
<LINE>And you the mutinous members: for examine</LINE>
<LINE>Their counsels and their cares; disgest things rightly</LINE>
<LINE>Touching the weal a&#8217; th&#8217; common, you shall find</LINE>
<LINE>No public benefit which you receive</LINE>
<LINE>But it proceeds or comes from them to you,</LINE>
<LINE>And no way from yourselves. What do you think,</LINE>
<LINE>You, the great toe of this assembly?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. CIT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I the great toe? Why the great toe?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For that, being one o&#8217; th&#8217; lowest, basest, poorest</LINE>
<LINE>Of this most wise rebellion, thou goest foremost;</LINE>
<LINE>Thou rascal, that art worst in blood to run,</LINE>
<LINE>Lead&#8217;st first to win some vantage.</LINE>
<LINE>But make you ready your stiff bats and clubs,</LINE>
<LINE>Rome and her rats are at the point of battle,</LINE>
<LINE>The one side must have bale.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR> Enter Caius Martius.</STAGEDIR>

<LINE offset="6">Hail, noble Martius!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thanks. What&#8217;s the matter, you dissentious rogues,</LINE>
<LINE>That rubbing the poor itch of your opinion</LINE>
<LINE>Make yourselves scabs?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. CIT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We have ever your good word.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He that will give good words to thee will flatter</LINE>
<LINE>Beneath abhorring. What would you have, you curs,</LINE>
<LINE>That like nor peace nor war? The one affrights you,</LINE>
<LINE>The other makes you proud. He that trusts to you,</LINE>
<LINE>Where he should find you lions, finds you hares;</LINE>
<LINE>Where foxes, geese. You are no surer, no,</LINE>
<LINE>Than is the coal of fire upon the ice,</LINE>
<LINE>Or hailstone in the sun. Your virtue is</LINE>
<LINE>To make him worthy whose offense subdues him,</LINE>
<LINE>And curse that justice did it. Who deserves greatness</LINE>
<LINE>Deserves your hate; and your affections are</LINE>
<LINE>A sick man&#8217;s appetite, who desires most that</LINE>
<LINE>Which would increase his evil. He that depends</LINE>
<LINE>Upon your favors swims with fins of lead,</LINE>
<LINE>And hews down oaks with rushes. Hang ye! Trust ye?</LINE>
<LINE>With every minute you do change a mind,</LINE>
<LINE>And call him noble, that was now your hate;</LINE>
<LINE>Him vild, that was your garland. What&#8217;s the matter,</LINE>
<LINE>That in these several places of the city</LINE>
<LINE>You cry against the noble Senate, who</LINE>
<LINE>(Under the gods) keep you in awe, which else</LINE>
<LINE>Would feed on one another? What&#8217;s their seeking?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For corn at their own rates, whereof they say</LINE>
<LINE>The city is well stor&#8217;d.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Hang &#8217;em! They say?</LINE>
<LINE>They&#8217;ll sit by th&#8217; fire, and presume to know</LINE>
<LINE>What&#8217;s done i&#8217; th&#8217; Capitol; who&#8217;s like to rise,</LINE>
<LINE>Who thrives, and who declines; side factions, and give out</LINE>
<LINE>Conjectural marriages, making parties strong,</LINE>
<LINE>And feebling such as stand not in their liking</LINE>
<LINE>Below their cobbled shoes. They say there&#8217;s grain enough?</LINE>
<LINE>Would the nobility lay aside their ruth</LINE>
<LINE>And let me use my sword, I&#8217;d make a quarry</LINE>
<LINE>With thousands of these quarter&#8217;d slaves, as high</LINE>
<LINE>As I could pick my lance.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, these are almost thoroughly persuaded;</LINE>
<LINE>For though abundantly they lack discretion,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet are they passing cowardly. But I beseech you,</LINE>
<LINE>What says the other troop?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">They are dissolv&#8217;d. Hang &#8217;em!</LINE>
<LINE>They said they were an-hungry; sigh&#8217;d forth proverbs—</LINE>
<LINE>That hunger broke stone walls, that dogs must eat,</LINE>
<LINE>That meat was made for mouths, that the gods sent not</LINE>
<LINE>Corn for the rich men only. With these shreds</LINE>
<LINE>They vented their complainings, which being answer&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>And a petition granted them—a strange one,</LINE>
<LINE>To break the heart of generosity</LINE>
<LINE>And make bold power look pale—they threw their caps</LINE>
<LINE>As they would hang them on the horns a&#8217; th&#8217; moon,</LINE>
<LINE>Shouting their emulation.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">What is granted them?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms,</LINE>
<LINE>Of their own choice. One&#8217;s Junius Brutus,</LINE>
<LINE>Sicinius Velutus, and I know not—&#8217;sdeath,</LINE>
<LINE>The rabble should have first unroof&#8217;d the city</LINE>
<LINE>Ere so prevail&#8217;d with me; it will in time</LINE>
<LINE>Win upon power, and throw forth greater themes</LINE>
<LINE>For insurrection&#8217;s arguing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I pray you, daughter, sing, or express yourself in a more comfortable sort. If my son were my husband, I should freelier rejoice in that absence wherein he won honor than in the embracements of his bed where he would show most love. When yet he was but tender-bodied and the only son of my womb; when youth with comeliness pluck&#8217;d all gaze his way; when for a day of kings&#8217; entreaties a mother should not sell him an hour from her beholding; I, considering how honor would become such a person, that it was no better than picture-like to hang by th&#8217; wall, if renown made it not stir, was pleas&#8217;d to let him seek danger where he was like to find fame. To a cruel war I sent him, from whence he return&#8217;d, his brows bound with oak. I tell thee, daughter, I sprang not more in joy at first hearing he was a man-child than now in first seeing he had prov&#8217;d himself a man.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VIR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But had he died in the business, madam, how then?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then his good report should have been my son; I therein would have found issue. Hear me profess sincerely; had I a dozen sons, each in my love alike, and none less dear than thine and my good Martius, I had rather had eleven die nobly for their country than one voluptuously surfeit out of action.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter a Gentlewoman.</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>Madam, the Lady Valeria is come to visit you.</LINE>

<LINE>Beseech you give me leave to retire myself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Indeed you shall not.</LINE>
<LINE>Methinks I hear hither your husband&#8217;s drum;</LINE>
<LINE>See him pluck Aufidius down by th&#8217; hair;</LINE>
<LINE>As children from a bear, the Volsces shunning him.</LINE>
<LINE>Methinks I see him stamp thus, and call thus:</LINE>
<LINE>&#8220;Come on, you cowards, you were got in fear,</LINE>
<LINE>Though you were born in Rome!&#8221; His bloody brow</LINE>
<LINE>With his mail&#8217;d hand then wiping, forth he goes,</LINE>
<LINE>Like to a harvest-man that&#8217;s task&#8217;d to mow</LINE>
<LINE>Or all or lose his hire.</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Away, you fool! It more becomes a man</LINE>
<LINE>Than gilt his trophy. The breasts of Hecuba,</LINE>

<LINE>How do you both? You are manifest house-keepers. What are you sewing here? A fine spot, in good faith. How does your little son?</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>A&#8217; my word, the father&#8217;s son. I&#8217;ll swear &#8217;tis a very pretty boy. A&#8217; my troth, I look&#8217;d upon him a&#8217; We&#8217;n&#8217;sday half an hour together; h&#8217;as such a confirm&#8217;d countenance. I saw him run after a gilded butterfly, and when he caught it, he let it go again, and after it again, and over and over he comes, and up again; catch&#8217;d it again: or whether his fallen rag&#8217;d him, or how &#8217;twas, he did so set his teeth and tear it. O, I warrant, how he mammock&#8217;d it!</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VIR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will wish her speedy strength, and visit her with my prayers; but I cannot go thither.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, I pray you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VIR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis not to save labor, nor that I want love.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You would be another Penelope: yet they say, all the yarn she spun in Ulysses&#8217; absence did but fill Ithaca full of moths. Come, I would your cambric were sensible as your finger, that you might leave pricking it for pity. Come, you shall go with us.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VIR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, good madam, pardon me, indeed I will not forth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In truth la, go with me, and I&#8217;ll tell you excellent news of your husband.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VIR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, good madam, there can be none yet.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Verily, I do not jest with you; there came news from him last night.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VIR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Indeed, madam?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In earnest, it&#8217;s true; I heard a senator speak it. Thus it is: the Volsces have an army forth; against whom Cominius the general is gone, with one part of our Roman power. Your lord and Titus Lartius are set down before their city Corioles; they nothing doubt prevailing, and to make it brief wars. This is true, on mine honor, and so I pray go with us.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VIR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Give me excuse, good madam, I will obey you in every thing hereafter.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Let her alone, lady; as she is now, she will but disease our better mirth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In troth, I think she would. Fare you well then. Come, good sweet lady. Prithee, Virgilia, turn thy solemnness out a&#8217; door, and go along with us.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VIR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, at a word, madam; indeed I must not.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Menenius with the two Tribunes of the people, Sicinius and Brutus.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The augurer tells me we shall have news tonight.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good or bad?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not according to the prayer of the people, for they love not Martius.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nature teaches beasts to know their friends.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pray you, who does the wolf love?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The lamb.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, to devour him, as the hungry plebeians would the noble Martius.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He&#8217;s a lamb indeed, that baes like a bear.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He&#8217;s a bear indeed, that lives like a lamb. You two are old men: tell me one thing that I shall ask you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BOTH. MEN. AND BRU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In what enormity is Martius poor in, that you two have not in abundance?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He&#8217;s poor in no one fault, but stor&#8217;d with all.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Especially in pride.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And topping all others in boasting.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This is strange now. Do you two know how you are censur&#8217;d here in the city, I mean of us a&#8217; th&#8217; right-hand file? Do you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BOTH. MEN. AND BRU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why? How are we censur&#8217;d?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Because you talk of pride now&#8212;will you not be angry?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BOTH. MEN. AND BRU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, well, sir, well.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, &#8217;tis no great matter; for a very little thief of occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience. Give your dispositions the reins and be angry at your pleasures; at the least, if you take it as a pleasure to you in being so. You blame Martius for being proud?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We do it not alone, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know you can do very little alone, for your helps are many, or else your actions would grow wondrous single; your abilities are too infant-like for doing much alone. You talk of pride: O that you could turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks and make but an interior survey of your good selves! O that you could!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BOTH. MEN. AND BRU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What then, sir?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why then you should discover a brace of unmeriting, proud, violent, testy magistrates (alias fools) as any in Rome.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Menenius, you are known well enough too.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am known to be a humorous patrician, and one that loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying Tiber in&#8217;t; said to be something imperfect in favoring the first complaint, hasty and tinder-like upon too trivial motion; one that converses more with the buttock of the night than with the forehead of the morning. What I think, I utter, and spend my malice in my breath. Meeting two such wealsmen as you are (I cannot call you Lycurguses), if the drink you give me touch my palate adversely, I make a crooked face at it. I cannot say your worships have deliver&#8217;d the matter well, when I find the ass in compound with the major part of your syllables; and though I must be content to bear with those that say you are reverend grave men, yet they lie deadly that tell you have good faces. If you see this in the map of my microcosm, follows it that I am known well enough too? What harm can your beesom conspectuities glean out of this character, if I be known well enough too?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, sir, come, we know you well enough.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You know neither me, yourselves, nor any thing. You are ambitious for poor knaves&#8217; caps and legs. You wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a cause between an orange-wife and a forset-seller, and then rejourn the controversy of threepence to a second day of audience. When you are hearing a matter between party and party, if you chance to be pinch&#8217;d with the colic, you make faces like mummers, set up the bloody flag against all patience, and in roaring for a chamber-pot, dismiss the controversy bleeding, the more entangled by your hearing. All the peace you make in their cause is calling both the parties knaves. You are a pair of strange ones.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, come, you are well understood to be a perfecter giber for the table than a necessary bencher in the Capitol.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Our very priests must become mockers if they shall encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are. When you speak best unto the purpose, it is not worth the wagging of your beards, and your beards deserve not so honorable a grave as to stuff a botcher&#8217;s cushion, or to be entomb&#8217;d in an ass&#8217;s pack-saddle. Yet you must be saying Martius is proud; who, in a cheap estimation, is worth all your predecessors since Deucalion, though peradventure some of the best of &#8217;em were hereditary hangmen. God-den to your worships; more of your conversation would infect my brain, being the herdsmen of the beastly plebeians. I will be bold to take my leave of you.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Brutus and Sicinius go aside.</STAGEDIR>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Volumnia, Virgilia, and Valeria.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>How now, my as fair as noble ladies&#8212;and the moon, were she earthly, no nobler&#8212;whither do you follow your eyes so fast?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Honorable Menenius, my boy Martius approaches. For the love of Juno, let&#8217;s go.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ha? Martius coming home?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, worthy Menenius, and with most prosperous approbation.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Take my cap, Jupiter, <STAGEDIR>Tosses it up</STAGEDIR> and I thank thee. Hoo! Martius coming home?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TWO LADIES (VIR., VAL.)</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, &#8217;tis true.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Look, here&#8217;s a letter from him; the state hath another, his wife another, and, I think, there&#8217;s one at home for you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will make my very house reel tonight. A letter for me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VIR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes certain, there&#8217;s a letter for you, I saw&#8217;t.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A letter for me! It gives me an estate of seven years&#8217; health, in which time I will make a lip at the physician. The most sovereign prescription in Galen is but empiricutic, and, to this preservative, of no better report than a horse-drench. Is he not wounded? He was wont to come home wounded.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VIR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O no, no, no.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, he is wounded, I thank the gods for&#8217;t.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So do I too, if it be not too much. Brings &#8217;a victory in his pocket? The wounds become him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>On &#8217;s brows. Menenius, he comes the third time home with the oaken garland.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Has he disciplin&#8217;d Aufidius soundly?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Titus Lartius writes they fought together, but Aufidius got off.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And &#8217;twas time for him too, I&#8217;ll warrant him that; and he had stay&#8217;d by him, I would not have been so fidius&#8217;d for all the chests in Corioles, and the gold that&#8217;s in them. Is the Senate possess&#8217;d of this?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good ladies, let&#8217;s go.&#8212;Yes, yes, yes; the Senate has letters from the general, wherein he gives my son the whole name of the war. He hath in this action outdone his former deeds doubly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In troth, there&#8217;s wondrous things spoke of him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Wondrous! Ay, I warrant you, and not without his true purchasing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>The gods grant them true!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>True? Pow, waw.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>True? I&#8217;ll be sworn they are true. Where is he wounded? <STAGEDIR>To the Tribunes.</STAGEDIR> God save your good worships! Martius is coming home; he has more cause to be proud.&#8212;Where is he wounded?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I&#8217; th&#8217; shoulder and i&#8217; th&#8217; left arm. There will be large cicatrices to show the people, when he shall stand for his place. He receiv&#8217;d in the repulse of Tarquin seven hurts i&#8217; th&#8217; body.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>One i&#8217; th&#8217; neck, and two i&#8217; th&#8217; thigh&#8212;there&#8217;s nine that I know.</LINE>

<LINE>He had, before this last expedition, twenty-five wounds upon him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now it&#8217;s twenty-seven; every gash was an enemy&#8217;s grave.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>A shout and flourish.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Hark, the trumpets.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>These are the ushers of Martius: before him he carries noise, and behind him he leaves tears:</LINE>
<LINE>Death, that dark spirit, in &#8217;s nervy arm doth lie,</LINE>
<LINE>Which, being advanc&#8217;d, declines, and then men die.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>A sennet. Trumpets sound. Enter Cominius the General, and Titus Lartius; between them, Coriolanus, crown&#8217;d with an oaken garland; with Captains and Soldiers and a Herald.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>All tongues speak of him, and the bleared sights</LINE>

<LINE>While she chats him; the kitchen malkin pins</LINE>
<LINE>Her richest lockram &#8217;bout her reechy neck,</LINE>

<LINE>Are smother&#8217;d up, leads fill&#8217;d, and ridges hors&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>With variable complexions, all agreeing</LINE>
<LINE>In earnestness to see him. Seld-shown flamens</LINE>
<LINE>Do press among the popular throngs, and puff</LINE>

<LINE>Commit the war of white and damask in</LINE>
<LINE>Their nicely gawded cheeks to th&#8217; wanton spoil</LINE>
<LINE>Of Phoebus&#8217; burning kisses&#8212;such a poother</LINE>

<LINE>You are sent for to the Capitol. &#8217;Tis thought</LINE>
<LINE>That Martius shall be consul.</LINE>
<LINE>I have seen the dumb men throng to see him, and</LINE>
<LINE>The blind to hear him speak. Matrons flung gloves,</LINE>
<LINE>Ladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers,</LINE>
<LINE>Upon him as he pass&#8217;d; the nobles bended,</LINE>
<LINE>As to Jove&#8217;s statue, and the commons made</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter two Officers to lay cushions, as it were in the Capitol.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. OFF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, come, they are almost here. How many stand for consulships?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. OFF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Three, they say; but &#8217;tis thought of every one Coriolanus will carry it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. OFF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That&#8217;s a brave fellow; but he&#8217;s vengeance proud, and loves not the common people.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. OFF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Faith, there hath been many great men that have flatter&#8217;d the people, who ne&#8217;er lov&#8217;d them; and there be many that they have lov&#8217;d, they know not wherefore; so that, if they love they know not why, they hate upon no better a ground. Therefore, for Coriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate him manifests the true knowledge he has in their disposition, and out of his noble carelessness lets them plainly see&#8217;t.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. OFF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If he did not care whether he had their love or no, he wav&#8217;d indifferently &#8217;twixt doing them neither good nor harm; but he seeks their hate with greater devotion than they can render it him, and leaves nothing undone that may fully discover him their opposite. Now, to seem to affect the malice and displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he dislikes, to flatter them for their love.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>He hath deserv&#8217;d worthily of his country, and his ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who, having been supple and courteous to the people, bonneted, without any further deed to have them at all into their estimation and report. But he hath so planted his honors in their eyes and his actions in their hearts that for their tongues to be silent and not confess so much were a kind of ingrateful injury; to report otherwise were a malice that, giving itself the lie, would pluck reproof and rebuke from every ear that heard it.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">Masters of the people,</LINE>
<LINE>Your multiplying spawn how can he flatter&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>That&#8217;s thousand to one good one&#8212;when you now see</LINE>
<LINE>He had rather venture all his limbs for honor</LINE>
<LINE>Than one on &#8217;s ears to hear it? Proceed, Cominius.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I shall lack voice: the deeds of Coriolanus</LINE>
<LINE>Should not be utter&#8217;d feebly. It is held</LINE>
<LINE>That valor is the chiefest virtue, and</LINE>
<LINE>Most dignifies the haver; if it be,</LINE>
<LINE>The man I speak of cannot in the world</LINE>
<LINE>Be singly counterpois&#8217;d. At sixteen years,</LINE>
<LINE>When Tarquin made a head for Rome, he fought</LINE>
<LINE>Beyond the mark of others. Our then dictator,</LINE>
<LINE>Whom with all praise I point at, saw him fight,</LINE>
<LINE>When with his Amazonian chin he drove</LINE>
<LINE>The bristled lips before him. He bestrid</LINE>
<LINE>An o&#8217;erpress&#8217;d Roman, and i&#8217; th&#8217; consul&#8217;s view</LINE>
<LINE>Slew three opposers. Tarquin&#8217;s self he met,</LINE>
<LINE>And struck him on his knee. In that day&#8217;s feats,</LINE>
<LINE>When he might act the woman in the scene,</LINE>
<LINE>He prov&#8217;d best man i&#8217; th&#8217; field, and for his meed</LINE>
<LINE>Was brow-bound with the oak. His pupil age</LINE>
<LINE>Man-ent&#8217;red thus, he waxed like a sea,</LINE>
<LINE>And in the brunt of seventeen battles since</LINE>
<LINE>He lurch&#8217;d all swords of the garland. For this last,</LINE>
<LINE>Before and in Corioles, let me say,</LINE>
<LINE>I cannot speak him home. He stopp&#8217;d the fliers,</LINE>
<LINE>And by his rare example made the coward</LINE>
<LINE>Turn terror into sport; as weeds before</LINE>
<LINE>A vessel under sail, so men obey&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>And fell below his stem. His sword, death&#8217;s stamp,</LINE>
<LINE>Where it did mark, it took; from face to foot</LINE>
<LINE>He was a thing of blood, whose every motion</LINE>
<LINE>Was tim&#8217;d with dying cries. Alone he ent&#8217;red</LINE>
<LINE>The mortal gate of th&#8217; city, which he painted</LINE>
<LINE>With shunless destiny; aidless came off,</LINE>
<LINE>And with a sudden reinforcement struck</LINE>
<LINE>Corioles like a planet. Now all&#8217;s his,</LINE>
<LINE>When by and by the din of war &#8217;gan pierce</LINE>
<LINE>His ready sense; then straight his doubled spirit</LINE>
<LINE>Requick&#8217;ned what in flesh was fatigate,</LINE>
<LINE>And to the battle came he, where he did</LINE>
<LINE>Run reeking o&#8217;er the lives of men, as if</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Twere a perpetual spoil; and till we call&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>Both field and city ours, he never stood</LINE>
<LINE>To ease his breast with panting.</LINE>

<SCENEPERSONAE>(Citizens, Coriolanus, Menenius, Brutus, Sicinius, Plebeians)</SCENEPERSONAE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter seven or eight Citizens.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. CIT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Once if he do require our voices, we ought not to deny him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. CIT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We may, sir, if we will.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>3. CIT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We have power in ourselves to do it, but it is a power that we have no power to do; for if he show us his wounds and tell us his deeds, we are to put our tongues into those wounds and speak for them; so, if he tell us his noble deeds, we must also tell him our noble acceptance of them. Ingratitude is monstrous, and for the multitude to be ingrateful were to make a monster of the multitude; of the which we being members, should bring ourselves to be monstrous members.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. CIT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And to make us no better thought of, a little help will serve; for once we stood up about the corn, he himself stuck not to call us the many-headed multitude.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>3. CIT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We have been call&#8217;d so of many, not that our heads are some brown, some black, some abram, some bald, but that our wits are so diversely color&#8217;d; and truly I think if all our wits were to issue out of one skull, they would fly east, west, north, south, and their consent of one direct way should be at once to all the points a&#8217; th&#8217; compass.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. CIT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Think you so? Which way do you judge my wit would fly?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>3. CIT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, your wit will not so soon out as another man&#8217;s will; &#8217;tis strongly wadg&#8217;d up in a block-head; but if it were at liberty, &#8217;twould sure southward.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. CIT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why that way?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>3. CIT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To lose itself in a fog, where being three parts melted away with rotten dews, the fourth would return for conscience&#8217; sake to help to get thee a wife.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>2. CIT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You are never without your tricks; you may, you may.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>3. CIT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Are you all resolv&#8217;d to give your voices? But that&#8217;s no matter, the greater part carries it, I say. If he would incline to the people, there was never a worthier man.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Coriolanus in a gown of humility, with Menenius.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Here he comes, and in the gown of humility, mark his behavior. We are not to stay all together, but to come by him where he stands, by ones, by twos, and by threes. He&#8217;s to make his requests by particulars, wherein every one of us has a single honor, in giving him our own voices with our own tongues; therefore follow me, and I&#8217;ll direct you how you shall go by him.</LINE>

<LINE>I got them in my country&#8217;s service, when</LINE>
<LINE>Some certain of your brethren roar&#8217;d, and ran</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>No, sir, &#8217;twas never my desire yet to trouble the poor with begging.</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You should account me the more virtuous that I have not been common in my love. I will, sir, flatter my sworn brother, the people, to earn a dearer estimation of them; &#8217;tis a condition they account gentle. And since the wisdom of their choice is rather to have my hat than my heart, I will practice the insinuating nod and be off to them most counterfeitly; that is, sir, I will counterfeit the bewitchment of some popular man, and give it bountiful to the desirers. Therefore beseech you I may be consul.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>5. CIT.</SPEAKER>

<LINE>Why in this woolvish toge should I stand here</LINE>
<LINE>To beg of Hob and Dick, that does appear,</LINE>
<LINE>Their needless vouches? Custom calls me to&#8217;t.</LINE>
<LINE>What custom wills, in all things should we do&#8217;t,</LINE>

<LINE>How now, my masters, have you chose this man?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. CIT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He has our voices, sir.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>BRU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We pray the gods he may deserve your loves.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. CIT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Amen, sir. To my poor unworthy notice,</LINE>
<LINE>He mock&#8217;d us when he begg&#8217;d our voices.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>3. CIT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="8">Certainly,</LINE>
<LINE>He flouted us downright.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. CIT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, &#8217;tis his kind of speech, he did not mock us.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. CIT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not one amongst us, save yourself, but says</LINE>
<LINE>He us&#8217;d us scornfully. He should have show&#8217;d us</LINE>
<LINE>His marks of merit, wounds receiv&#8217;d for &#8217;s country.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIC.</SPEAKER>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>3. CIT.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He said he had wounds, which he could show in private;</LINE>
<LINE>And with his hat, thus waving it in scorn,</LINE>
<LINE>&#8220;I would be consul,&#8221; says he; &#8220;aged custom,</LINE>
<LINE>But by your voices, will not so permit me;</LINE>
<LINE>Your voices therefore.&#8221; When we granted that,</LINE>
<LINE>Here was &#8220;I thank you for your voices, thank you,</LINE>
<LINE>Your most sweet voices. Now you have left your voices,</LINE>
<LINE>I have no further with you.&#8221; Was not this mockery?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why either were you ignorant to see&#8217;t,</LINE>
<LINE>Or, seeing it, of such childish friendliness</LINE>
<LINE>To yield your voices?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Could you not have told him</LINE>
<LINE>As you were lesson&#8217;d: when he had no power,</LINE>
<LINE>But was a petty servant to the state,</LINE>
<LINE>He was your enemy, ever spake against</LINE>
<LINE>Your liberties and the charters that you bear</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217; th&#8217; body of the weal; and now, arriving</LINE>
<LINE>A place of potency and sway o&#8217; th&#8217; state,</LINE>
<LINE>If he should still malignantly remain</LINE>
<LINE>Fast foe to th&#8217; plebeii, your voices might</LINE>
<LINE>Be curses to yourselves? You should have said</LINE>
<LINE>That as his worthy deeds did claim no less</LINE>
<LINE>Than what he stood for, so his gracious nature</LINE>
<LINE>Would think upon you for your voices, and</LINE>
<LINE>Translate his malice towards you into love,</LINE>
<LINE>Standing your friendly lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Thus to have said,</LINE>
<LINE>As you were fore-advis&#8217;d, had touch&#8217;d his spirit</LINE>
<LINE>And tried his inclination; from him pluck&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>Either his gracious promise, which you might,</LINE>
<LINE>As cause had call&#8217;d you up, have held him to;</LINE>
<LINE>Or else it would have gall&#8217;d his surly nature,</LINE>
<LINE>Which easily endures not article</LINE>
<LINE>Tying him to aught; so putting him to rage,</LINE>
<LINE>You should have ta&#8217;en th&#8217; advantage of his choler,</LINE>
<LINE>And pass&#8217;d him unelected.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Did you perceive</LINE>
<LINE>He did solicit you in free contempt</LINE>
<LINE>When he did need your loves; and do you think</LINE>
<LINE>That his contempt shall not be bruising to you</LINE>
<LINE>When he hath power to crush? Why, had your bodies</LINE>
<LINE>No heart among you? Or had you tongues to cry</LINE>
<LINE>Against the rectorship of judgment?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">Have you</LINE>
<LINE>Ere now denied the asker; and now again,</LINE>

<LINE>Your su&#8217;d-for tongues?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>He&#8217;s not confirm&#8217;d, we may deny him yet.</LINE>

<LINE>I&#8217;ll have five hundred voices of that sound.</LINE>

<LINE>Get you hence instantly, and tell those friends</LINE>
<LINE>They have chose a consul that will from them take</LINE>

<LINE>As therefore kept to do so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Let them assemble;</LINE>
<LINE>And on a safer judgment all revoke</LINE>
<LINE>Your ignorant election. Enforce his pride,</LINE>
<LINE>And his old hate unto you; besides, forget not</LINE>
<LINE>With what contempt he wore the humble weed,</LINE>
<LINE>How in his suit he scorn&#8217;d you; but your loves,</LINE>
<LINE>Thinking upon his services, took from you</LINE>
<LINE>Th&#8217; apprehension of his present portance,</LINE>
<LINE>Which most gibingly, ungravely, he did fashion</LINE>
<LINE>After the inveterate hate he bears you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="8">Lay</LINE>
<LINE>A fault on us, your tribunes, that we labor&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>(No impediment between) but that you must</LINE>
<LINE>Cast your election on him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Say you chose him</LINE>
<LINE>More after our commandment than as guided</LINE>
<LINE>By your own true affections, and that your minds,</LINE>
<LINE>Preoccupied with what you rather must do</LINE>
<LINE>Than what you should, made you against the grain</LINE>
<LINE>To voice him consul. Lay the fault on us.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, spare us not. Say we read lectures to you,</LINE>
<LINE>How youngly he began to serve his country,</LINE>
<LINE>How long continued, and what stock he springs of&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>The noble house o&#8217; th&#8217; Martians; from whence came</LINE>
<LINE>That Ancus Martius, Numa&#8217;s daughter&#8217;s son,</LINE>
<LINE>Who after great Hostilius here was king;</LINE>
<LINE>Of the same house Publius and Quintus were,</LINE>
<LINE>That our best water brought by conduits hither,</LINE>
<LINE>And Censorinus that was so surnam&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>And nobly named so, twice being censor,</LINE>
<LINE>Was his great ancestor.</LINE>

<LINE offset="5">One thus descended,</LINE>

<LINE>That with his peremptory &#8220;shall,&#8221; being but</LINE>
<LINE>The horn and noise o&#8217; th&#8217; monster&#8217;s, wants not spirit</LINE>
<LINE>To say he&#8217;ll turn your current in a ditch,</LINE>
<LINE>And make your channel his? If he have power,</LINE>
<LINE>Then vail your ignorance; if none, awake</LINE>
<LINE>Your dangerous lenity. If you are learn&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Be not as common fools; if you are not,</LINE>

<LINE>If they be senators; and they are no less,</LINE>

<LINE>His popular &#8216;shall,&#8217; against a graver bench</LINE>

<LINE>Even when the navel of the state was touch&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>They would not thread the gates. This kind of service</LINE>
<LINE>Did not deserve corn gratis. Being i&#8217; th&#8217; war,</LINE>
<LINE>Their mutinies and revolts, wherein they show&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>Most valor, spoke not for them. Th&#8217; accusation</LINE>
<LINE>Which they have often made against the Senate,</LINE>
<LINE>All cause unborn, could never be the native</LINE>
<LINE>Of our so frank donation. Well, what then?</LINE>
<LINE>How shall this bosom multiplied digest</LINE>
<LINE>The Senate&#8217;s courtesy? Let deeds express</LINE>
<LINE>What&#8217;s like to be their words: &#8220;We did request it,</LINE>
<LINE>We are the greater pole, and in true fear</LINE>
<LINE>They gave us our demands.&#8221; Thus we debase</LINE>
<LINE>The nature of our seats and make the rabble</LINE>
<LINE>Call our cares fears; which will in time</LINE>
<LINE>Break ope the locks a&#8217; th&#8217; Senate, and bring in</LINE>
<LINE>The crows to peck the eagles.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My name is Caius Martius, who hath done</LINE>
<LINE>To thee particularly, and to all the Volsces,</LINE>
<LINE>Great hurt and mischief; thereto witness may</LINE>
<LINE>My surname, Coriolanus. The painful service,</LINE>
<LINE>The extreme dangers, and the drops of blood</LINE>
<LINE>Shed for my thankless country are requited</LINE>
<LINE>But with that surname&#8212;a good memory</LINE>
<LINE>And witness of the malice and displeasure</LINE>
<LINE>Which thou shouldst bear me. Only that name remains;</LINE>
<LINE>The cruelty and envy of the people,</LINE>
<LINE>Permitted by our dastard nobles, who</LINE>
<LINE>Have all forsook me, hath devour&#8217;d the rest,</LINE>
<LINE>And suffer&#8217;d me by th&#8217; voice of slaves to be</LINE>
<LINE>Hoop&#8217;d out of Rome. Now this extremity</LINE>
<LINE>Hath brought me to thy hearth; not out of hope</LINE>
<LINE>(Mistake me not) to save my life, for if</LINE>
<LINE>I had fear&#8217;d death, of all the men i&#8217; th&#8217; world</LINE>
<LINE>I would have &#8217;voided thee; but in mere spite,</LINE>
<LINE>To be full quit of those my banishers,</LINE>
<LINE>Stand I before thee here. Then if thou hast</LINE>
<LINE>A heart of wreak in thee, that wilt revenge</LINE>
<LINE>Thine own particular wrongs, and stop those maims</LINE>
<LINE>Of shame seen through thy country, speed thee straight</LINE>
<LINE>And make my misery serve thy turn. So use it</LINE>
<LINE>That my revengeful services may prove</LINE>
<LINE>As benefits to thee; for I will fight</LINE>
<LINE>Against my cank&#8217;red country with the spleen</LINE>
<LINE>Of all the under fiends. But if so be</LINE>
<LINE>Thou dar&#8217;st not this, and that to prove more fortunes</LINE>
<LINE>Th&#8217; art tir&#8217;d, then, in a word, I also am</LINE>
<LINE>Longer to live most weary, and present</LINE>
<LINE>My throat to thee and to thy ancient malice;</LINE>
<LINE>Which not to cut would show thee but a fool,</LINE>
<LINE>Since I have ever followed thee with hate,</LINE>
<LINE>Drawn tuns of blood out of thy country&#8217;s breast,</LINE>
<LINE>And cannot live but to thy shame, unless</LINE>
<LINE>It be to do thee service.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">O Martius, Martius!</LINE>
<LINE>Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart</LINE>
<LINE>A root of ancient envy. If Jupiter</LINE>
<LINE>Should from yond cloud speak divine things,</LINE>
<LINE>And say &#8220;&#8217;Tis true,&#8221; I&#8217;d not believe them more</LINE>
<LINE>Than thee, all-noble Martius. Let me twine</LINE>
<LINE>Mine arms about that body, where against</LINE>
<LINE>My grained ash an hundred times hath broke,</LINE>
<LINE>And scarr&#8217;d the moon with splinters. Here I cleep</LINE>
<LINE>The anvil of my sword, and do contest</LINE>
<LINE>As hotly and as nobly with thy love</LINE>
<LINE>As ever in ambitious strength I did</LINE>
<LINE>Contend against thy valor. Know thou first,</LINE>
<LINE>I lov&#8217;d the maid I married; never man</LINE>
<LINE>Sigh&#8217;d truer breath; but that I see thee here,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou noble thing, more dances my rapt heart</LINE>
<LINE>Than when I first my wedded mistress saw</LINE>
<LINE>Bestride my threshold. Why, thou Mars, I tell thee,</LINE>
<LINE>We have a power on foot; and I had purpose</LINE>
<LINE>Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn,</LINE>
<LINE>Or lose mine arm for&#8217;t. Thou hast beat me out</LINE>
<LINE>Twelve several times, and I have nightly since</LINE>
<LINE>Dreamt of encounters &#8217;twixt thyself and me;</LINE>
<LINE>We have been down together in my sleep,</LINE>
<LINE>Unbuckling helms, fisting each other&#8217;s throat,</LINE>
<LINE>And wak&#8217;d half dead with nothing. Worthy Martius,</LINE>
<LINE>Had we no other quarrel else to Rome but that</LINE>
<LINE>Thou art thence banish&#8217;d, we would muster all</LINE>
<LINE>From twelve to seventy, and pouring war</LINE>
<LINE>Into the bowels of ungrateful Rome,</LINE>
<LINE>Like a bold flood o&#8217;er-beat. O, come, go in,</LINE>
<LINE>And take our friendly senators by th&#8217; hands,</LINE>
<LINE>Who now are here, taking their leaves of me,</LINE>

<SPEAKER>1. SERV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here&#8217;s a strange alteration!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. SERV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By my hand, I had thought to have strooken him with a cudgel, and yet my mind gave me his clothes made a false report of him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. SERV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What an arm he has! He turn&#8217;d me about with his finger and his thumb as one would set up a top.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. SERV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, I knew by his face that there was something in him. He had, sir, a kind of face, me-thought&#8212;I cannot tell how to term it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. SERV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He had so, looking as it were&#8212;Would I were hang&#8217;d but I thought there was more in him than I could think.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. SERV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So did I, I&#8217;ll be sworn. He is simply the rarest man i&#8217; th&#8217; world.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. SERV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I think he is; but a greater soldier than he, you wot one.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. SERV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who, my master?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. SERV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, it&#8217;s no matter for that.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. SERV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Worth six on him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. SERV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, not so neither; but I take him to be the greater soldier.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. SERV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Faith, look you, one cannot tell how to say that. For the defense of a town, our general is excellent.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. SERV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, and for an assault too.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter the Third Servingman.</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>O slaves, I can tell you news&#8212;news, you rascals!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BOTH 1. SERV. AND 2. SERV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, what, what? Let&#8217;s partake.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>3. SERV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would not be a Roman, of all nations; I had as live be a condemn&#8217;d man.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BOTH 1. SERV. AND 2. SERV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Wherefore? Wherefore?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>3. SERV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, here&#8217;s he that was wont to thwack our general, Caius Martius.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. SERV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why do you say &#8220;thwack our general&#8221;?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>3. SERV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do not say &#8220;thwack our general,&#8221; but he was always good enough for him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. SERV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, we are fellows and friends: he was ever too hard for him; I have heard him say so himself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. SERV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He was too hard for him, directly to say the troth on&#8217;t,
before Corioles; he scotch&#8217;d him and notch&#8217;d him like a carbinado.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. SERV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And he had been cannibally given, he might have boil&#8217;d and eaten him too.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. SERV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But more of thy news.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>3. SERV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, he is so made on here within as if he were son and heir to Mars; set at upper end o&#8217; th&#8217; table; no question ask&#8217;d him by any of the senators but they stand bald before him. Our general himself makes a mistress of him, sanctifies himself with &#8217;s hand, and turns up the white o&#8217; th&#8217; eye to his discourse. But the bottom of the news is, our general is cut i&#8217; th&#8217; middle, and but one half of what he was yesterday; for the other has half by the entreaty and grant of the whole table. He&#8217;ll go, he says, and sowl the porter of Rome gates by th&#8217; ears. He will mow all down before him, and leave his passage poll&#8217;d.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. SERV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And he&#8217;s as like to do&#8217;t as any man I can imagine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>3. SERV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do&#8217;t? He will do&#8217;t; for look you, sir, he has as many friends as enemies; which friends, sir, as it were, durst not (look you, sir) show themselves (as we term it) his friends whilest he&#8217;s in directitude.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. SERV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Directitude? What&#8217;s that?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>3. SERV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But when they shall see, sir, his crest up again and the man in blood, they will out of their burrows, like conies after rain, and revel all with him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. SERV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But when goes this forward?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>3. SERV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tomorrow, today, presently; you shall have the drum strook up this afternoon. &#8217;Tis, as it were, a parcel of their feast, and to be executed ere they wipe their lips.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. SERV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why then we shall have a stirring world again. This peace is nothing but to rust iron, increase tailors, and breed ballad-makers.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. SERV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let me have war, say I, it exceeds peace as far as day does night; it&#8217;s sprightly, waking, audible, and full of vent. Peace is a very apoplexy, lethargy, mull&#8217;d, deaf, sleepy, insensible, a getter of more bastard children than war&#8217;s a destroyer of men.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. SERV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis so, and as wars, in some sort, may be said to be a ravisher, so it cannot be denied but peace is a great maker of cuckolds.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. SERV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, and it makes men hate one another.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>3. SERV.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Reason: because they then less need one another. The wars for my money! I hope to see Romans as cheap as Volscians.&#8212;They are rising, they are rising.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>LIEU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do not know what witchcraft&#8217;s in him, but</LINE>
<LINE>Your soldiers use him as the grace &#8217;fore meat,</LINE>
<LINE>Their talk at table, and their thanks at end;</LINE>

<LINE offset="4">I cannot help it now,</LINE>
<LINE>Unless by using means I lame the foot</LINE>
<LINE>Of our design. He bears himself more proudlier,</LINE>

<LINE>When first I did embrace him; yet his nature</LINE>
<LINE>In that&#8217;s no changeling, and I must excuse</LINE>

<SPEAKER>LIEU.</SPEAKER>

<SPEAKER>AUF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I understand thee well, and be thou sure,</LINE>
<LINE>When he shall come to his account, he knows not</LINE>
<LINE>What I can urge against him. Although it seems,</LINE>
<LINE>And so he thinks, and is no less apparent</LINE>
<LINE>To th&#8217; vulgar eye, that he bears all things fairly,</LINE>
<LINE>And shows good husbandry for the Volscian state,</LINE>
<LINE>Fights dragon-like, and does achieve as soon</LINE>
<LINE>As draw his sword; yet he hath left undone</LINE>
<LINE>That which shall break his neck, or hazard mine,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LIEU.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, I beseech you, think you he&#8217;ll carry Rome?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>All places yields to him ere he sits down,</LINE>
<LINE>And the nobility of Rome are his.</LINE>
<LINE>The senators and patricians love him too;</LINE>
<LINE>The tribunes are no soldiers, and their people</LINE>
<LINE>Will be as rash in the repeal, as hasty</LINE>
<LINE>To expel him thence. I think he&#8217;ll be to Rome</LINE>
<LINE>As is the aspray to the fish, who takes it</LINE>
<LINE>By sovereignty of nature. First he was</LINE>
<LINE>A noble servant to them, but he could not</LINE>
<LINE>Carry his honors even. Whether &#8217;twas pride,</LINE>
<LINE>Which out of daily fortune ever taints</LINE>
<LINE>The happy man; whether defect of judgment,</LINE>
<LINE>To fail in the disposing of those chances</LINE>
<LINE>Which he was lord of; or whether nature,</LINE>
<LINE>Not to be other than one thing, not moving</LINE>
<LINE>From th&#8217; casque to th&#8217; cushion, but commanding peace</LINE>
<LINE>Even with the same austerity and garb</LINE>
<LINE>As he controll&#8217;d the war; but one of these</LINE>
<LINE>(As he hath spices of them all, not all,</LINE>
<LINE>For I dare so far free him) made him fear&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>So hated, and so banish&#8217;d; but he has a merit</LINE>
<LINE>To choke it in the utt&#8217;rance. So our virtues</LINE>
<LINE>Lie in th&#8217; interpretation of the time,</LINE>
<LINE>And power, unto itself most commendable,</LINE>
<LINE>Hath not a tomb so evident as a chair</LINE>
<LINE>T&#8217; extol what it hath done.</LINE>
<LINE>One fire drives out one fire; one nail, one nail;</LINE>
<LINE>Rights by rights fouler, strengths by strengths do fail.</LINE>
<LINE>Come, let&#8217;s away. When, Caius, Rome is thine,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou art poor&#8217;st of all; then shortly art thou mine.</LINE>

<LINE>No, I&#8217;ll not go. You hear what he hath said</LINE>

<SPEAKER>COM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yet one time he did call me by my name.</LINE>
<LINE>I urg&#8217;d our old acquaintance, and the drops</LINE>
<LINE>That we have bled together. Coriolanus</LINE>
<LINE>He would not answer to; forbade all names;</LINE>
<LINE>He was a kind of nothing, titleless,</LINE>
<LINE>Till he had forg&#8217;d himself a name a&#8217; th&#8217; fire</LINE>
<LINE>Of burning Rome.</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>I minded him how royal &#8217;twas to pardon</LINE>

<LINE>To one whom they had punish&#8217;d.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">Very well.</LINE>
<LINE>Could he say less?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I offered to awaken his regard</LINE>
<LINE>For &#8217;s private friends. His answer to me was,</LINE>
<LINE>He could not stay to pick them in a pile</LINE>
<LINE>Of noisome musty chaff. He said &#8217;twas folly,</LINE>
<LINE>For one poor grain or two, to leave unburnt</LINE>
<LINE>And still to nose th&#8217; offense.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">For one poor grain or two?</LINE>
<LINE>I am one of those; his mother, wife, his child,</LINE>
<LINE>And this brave fellow too: we are the grains,</LINE>
<LINE>You are the musty chaff, and you are smelt</LINE>
<LINE>Above the moon. We must be burnt for you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIC.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, pray be patient. If you refuse your aid</LINE>
<LINE>In this so never-needed help, yet do not</LINE>
<LINE>Upbraid &#8217;s with our distress. But sure if you</LINE>
<LINE>Would be your country&#8217;s pleader, your good tongue,</LINE>
<LINE>More than the instant army we can make,</LINE>

<LINE>He was not taken well, he had not din&#8217;d:</LINE>
<LINE>The veins unfill&#8217;d, our blood is cold, and then</LINE>
<LINE>We pout upon the morning, are unapt</LINE>

<LINE>Like to a bowl upon a subtle ground,</LINE>

Can you think to blow out the intended fire your city is ready to flame in, with such weak breath as this? No, you are deceiv&#8217;d; therefore back to Rome, and prepare for your execution.

<LINE>Bid them repair to th&#8217; market-place, where I,</LINE>
<LINE>Even in theirs and in the commons&#8217; ears,</LINE>
<LINE>Will vouch the truth of it. Him I accuse</LINE>
<LINE>The city ports by this hath enter&#8217;d, and</LINE>
<LINE>Intends t&#8217; appear before the people, hoping</LINE>
<LINE>To purge himself with words. Dispatch.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt Attendants.</STAGEDIR>
<STAGEDIR>Enter three or four Conspirators of Aufidius&#8217; faction.</STAGEDIR>

<LINE offset="8">Most welcome!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. CONSP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How is it with our general?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">Even so</LINE>
<LINE>As with a man by his own alms empoison&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>And with his charity slain.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. CONSP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Most noble sir,</LINE>
<LINE>If you do hold the same intent wherein</LINE>
<LINE>You wish&#8217;d us parties, we&#8217;ll deliver you</LINE>
<LINE>Of your great danger.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">Sir, I cannot tell,</LINE>
<LINE>We must proceed as we do find the people.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>3. CONSP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The people will remain uncertain whilst</LINE>
<LINE>&#8217;Twixt you there&#8217;s difference; but the fall of either</LINE>
<LINE>Makes the survivor heir of all.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="7">I know it;</LINE>
<LINE>And my pretext to strike at him admits</LINE>
<LINE>A good construction. I rais&#8217;d him, and I pawn&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>Mine honor for his truth; who being so heighten&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>He watered his new plants with dews of flattery,</LINE>
<LINE>Seducing so my friends; and, to this end,</LINE>
<LINE>He bow&#8217;d his nature, never known before</LINE>
<LINE>But to be rough, unswayable, and free.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>3. CONSP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, his stoutness</LINE>
<LINE>When he did stand for consul, which he lost</LINE>
<LINE>By lack of stooping&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">That I would have spoke of:</LINE>
<LINE>Being banish&#8217;d for&#8217;t, he came unto my hearth,</LINE>
<LINE>Presented to my knife his throat. I took him;</LINE>
<LINE>Made him joint-servant with me; gave him way</LINE>
<LINE>In all his own desires; nay, let him choose</LINE>
<LINE>Out of my files, his projects to accomplish,</LINE>
<LINE>My best and freshest men; serv&#8217;d his designments</LINE>
<LINE>In mine own person; holp to reap the fame</LINE>
<LINE>Which he did end all his, and took some pride</LINE>
<LINE>To do myself this wrong; till at the last</LINE>
<LINE>I seem&#8217;d his follower, not partner, and</LINE>
<LINE>He wag&#8217;d me with his countenance as if</LINE>
<LINE>I had been mercenary.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. CONSP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">So he did, my lord.</LINE>
<LINE>The army marvell&#8217;d at it, and in the last,</LINE>
<LINE>When he had carried Rome and that we look&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>For no less spoil than glory&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">There was it;</LINE>
<LINE>For which my sinews shall be stretch&#8217;d upon him:</LINE>
<LINE>At a few drops of women&#8217;s rheum, which are</LINE>
<LINE>As cheap as lies, he sold the blood and labor</LINE>
<LINE>Of our great action; therefore shall he die,</LINE>
<LINE>And I&#8217;ll renew me in his fall. But hark!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Drums and trumpets sounds, with great shouts of the people.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. CONSP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your native town you enter&#8217;d like a post,</LINE>
<LINE>And had no welcomes home, but he returns</LINE>
<LINE>Splitting the air with noise.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>2. CONSP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">And patient fools,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose children he hath slain, their base throats tear</LINE>
<LINE>With giving him glory.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>3. CONSP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">Therefore at your vantage,</LINE>
<LINE>Ere he express himself or move the people</LINE>
<LINE>With what he would say, let him feel your sword,</LINE>
<LINE>Which we will second. When he lies along,</LINE>
<LINE>After your way his tale pronounc&#8217;d shall bury</LINE>
<LINE>His reasons with his body.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUF.</SPEAKER>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALL LORDS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">We have.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>1. LORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="8">And grieve to hear&#8217;t.</LINE>
<LINE>What faults he made before the last, I think</LINE>
<LINE>Might have found easy fines; but there to end</LINE>
<LINE>Where he was to begin, and give away</LINE>
<LINE>The benefit of our levies, answering us</LINE>
<LINE>With our own charge, making a treaty where</LINE>
<LINE>There was a yielding&#8212;this admits no excuse.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AUF.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He approaches, you shall hear him.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Coriolanus marching with Drum and Colors, the Commoners being with him.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COR.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hail, lords! I am return&#8217;d your soldier;</LINE>
<LINE>No more infected with my country&#8217;s love</LINE>

<LINE>Under your great command. You are to know</LINE>
<LINE>That prosperously I have attempted, and</LINE>
<LINE>With bloody passage led your wars even to</LINE>
<LINE>The gates of Rome. Our spoils we have brought home</LINE>
<LINE>Doth more than counterpoise a full third part</LINE>
<LINE>The charges of the action. We have made peace</LINE>
<LINE>With no less honor to the Antiates</LINE>
<LINE>Than shame to th&#8217; Romans; and we here deliver,</LINE>
<LINE>Subscrib&#8217;d by th&#8217; consuls and patricians,</LINE>
<LINE>Together with the seal a&#8217; th&#8217; Senate, what</LINE>
<LINE>We have compounded on.</LINE>

<LINE>You lords and heads a&#8217; th&#8217; state, perfidiously</LINE>
<LINE>He has betray&#8217;d your business, and given up,</LINE>
<LINE>For certain drops of salt, your city Rome,</LINE>
<LINE>I say &#8220;your city,&#8221; to his wife and mother,</LINE>
<LINE>Breaking his oath and resolution like</LINE>
<LINE>A twist of rotten silk, never admitting</LINE>
<LINE>Counsel a&#8217; th&#8217; war; but at his nurse&#8217;s tears</LINE>
<LINE>He whin&#8217;d and roar&#8217;d away your victory,</LINE>

<LINE>Measureless liar, thou hast made my heart</LINE>
<LINE>Too great for what contains it. &#8220;Boy&#8221;? O slave!</LINE>
<LINE>Pardon me, lords, &#8217;tis the first time that ever</LINE>
<LINE>I was forc&#8217;d to scold. Your judgments, my grave lords,</LINE>
