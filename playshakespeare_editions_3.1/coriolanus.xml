<stagedir>Enter a company of mutinous Roman Citizens with staves, clubs, and other weapons.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>1. ROM. CIT.</speaker>
<line>Before we proceed any further, hear me speak.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ALL. ROM. CIT.</speaker>
<line>Speak, speak.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. ROM. CIT.</speaker>
<line>You are all resolv&#8217;d rather to die than to famish?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ALL. ROM. CIT.</speaker>
<line>Resolv&#8217;d, resolv&#8217;d.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. ROM. CIT.</speaker>
<line>First, you know Caius Martius is chief enemy to the people.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ALL. ROM. CIT.</speaker>
<line>We know&#8217;t, we know&#8217;t.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. ROM. CIT.</speaker>
<line>Let us kill him, and we&#8217;ll have corn at our own price. Is&#8217;t a verdict?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ALL. ROM. CIT.</speaker>
<line>No more talking on&#8217;t; let it be done. Away, away!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. ROM. CIT.</speaker>
<line>One word, good citizens.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. ROM. CIT.</speaker>
<line>We are accounted poor citizens, the patricians good. What authority surfeits on would relieve us. If they would yield us but the superfluity while it were wholesome, we might guess they reliev&#8217;d us humanely; but they think we are too dear. The leanness that afflicts us, the object of our misery, is as an inventory to particularize their abundance; our sufferance is a gain to them. Let us revenge this with our pikes, ere we become rakes; for the gods know I speak this in hunger for bread, not in thirst for revenge.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. ROM. CIT.</speaker>
<line>Would you proceed especially against Caius Martius?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. ROM. CIT.</speaker>
<line>Against him first; he&#8217;s a very dog to the commonalty.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. ROM. CIT.</speaker>
<line>Consider you what services he has done for his country?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. ROM. CIT.</speaker>
<line>Very well, and could be content to give him good report for&#8217;t, but that he pays himself with being proud.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. ROM. CIT.</speaker>
<line>Nay, but speak not maliciously.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. ROM. CIT.</speaker>
<line>I say unto you, what he hath done famously, he did it to that end. Though soft-conscienc&#8217;d men can be content to say it was for his country, he did it to please his mother, and to be partly proud, which he is, even to the altitude of his virtue.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. ROM. CIT.</speaker>
<line>What he cannot help in his nature, you account a vice in him. You must in no way say he is covetous.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. ROM. CIT.</speaker>
<line>If I must not, I need not be barren of accusations; he hath faults (with surplus) to tire in repetition.</line>
<stagedir>Shouts within.</stagedir>
<line>What shouts are these? The other side a&#8217; th&#8217; city is risen; why stay we prating here? To th&#8217; Capitol!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ALL. ROM. CIT.</speaker>
<line>Come, come.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. ROM. CIT.</speaker>
<line>Soft, who comes here?</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Menenius Agrippa.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>2. ROM. CIT.</speaker>
<line>Worthy Menenius Agrippa, one that hath always lov&#8217;d the people.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. ROM. CIT.</speaker>
<line>He&#8217;s one honest enough; would all the rest were so!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MEN.</speaker>
<line>What work&#8217;s, my countrymen, in hand? Where go you</line>
<line>With bats and clubs? The matter? Speak, I pray you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. ROM. CIT.</speaker>
<line>Our business is not unknown to th&#8217; Senate; they have had inkling this fortnight what we intend to do, which now we&#8217;ll show &#8217;em in deeds. They say poor suitors have strong breaths; they shall know we have strong arms too.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MEN.</speaker>
<line>Why, masters, my good friends, mine honest neighbors,</line>
<line>Will you undo yourselves?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. ROM. CIT.</speaker>
<line>We cannot, sir, we are undone already.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MEN.</speaker>
<line>I tell you, friends, most charitable care</line>
<line>Have the patricians of you. For your wants,</line>
<line>Your suffering in this dearth, you may as well</line>
<line>Strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them</line>
<line>Against the Roman state, whose course will on</line>
<line>The way it takes, cracking ten thousand curbs</line>
<line>Of more strong link asunder than can ever</line>
<line>Appear in your impediment. For the dearth,</line>
<line>The gods, not the patricians, make it, and</line>
<line>Your knees to them (not arms) must help. Alack,</line>
<line>You are transported by calamity</line>
<line>Thither where more attends you, and you slander</line>
<line>The helms o&#8217; th&#8217; state, who care for you like fathers,</line>
<line>When you curse them as enemies.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. ROM. CIT.</speaker>
<line>Care for us? True indeed! They ne&#8217;er car&#8217;d for us yet. Suffer us to famish, and their store-houses cramm&#8217;d with grain; make edicts for usury, to support usurers; repeal daily any wholesome act establish&#8217;d against the rich, and provide more piercing statutes daily to chain up and restrain the poor. If the wars eat us not up, they will; and there&#8217;s all the love they bear us.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MEN.</speaker>
<line>Either you must</line>
<line>Confess yourselves wondrous malicious,</line>
<line>Or be accus&#8217;d of folly. I shall tell you</line>
<line>A pretty tale. It may be you have heard it,</line>
<line>But, since it serves my purpose, I will venture</line>
<line>To stale &#8217;t a little more.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. ROM. CIT.</speaker>
<line>Well, I&#8217;ll hear it, sir; yet you must not think to fob off our disgrace with a tale. But and&#8217;t please you, deliver.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MEN.</speaker>
<line>There was a time when all the body&#8217;s members</line>
<line>Rebell&#8217;d against the belly; thus accus&#8217;d it:</line>
<line>That only like a gulf it did remain</line>
<line>I&#8217; th&#8217; midst a&#8217; th&#8217; body, idle and unactive,</line>
<line>Still cupboarding the viand, never bearing</line>
<line>Like labor with the rest, where th&#8217; other instruments</line>
<line>Did see and hear, devise, instruct, walk, feel,</line>
<line>And, mutually participate, did minister</line>
<line>Unto the appetite and affection common</line>
<line>Of the whole body. The belly answer&#8217;d—</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. ROM. CIT.</speaker>
<line>Well, sir, what answer made the belly?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MEN.</speaker>
<line>Sir, I shall tell you. With a kind of smile,</line>
<line>Which ne&#8217;er came from the lungs, but even thus—</line>
<line>For, look you, I may make the belly smile</line>
<line>As well as speak—it tauntingly replied</line>
<line>To th&#8217; discontented members, the mutinous parts</line>
<line>That envied his receipt; even so most fitly</line>
<line>As you malign our senators for that</line>
<line>They are not such as you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. ROM. CIT.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Your belly&#8217;s answer—what?</line>
<line>The kingly-crowned head, the vigilant eye,</line>
<line>The counsellor heart, the arm our soldier,</line>
<line>Our steed the leg, the tongue our trumpeter,</line>
<line>With other muniments and petty helps</line>
<line>In this our fabric, if that they—</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MEN.</speaker>
<line offset="7">What then?</line>
<line>&#8217;Fore me, this fellow speaks! What then? What then?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. ROM. CIT.</speaker>
<line>Should by the cormorant belly be restrain&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Who is the sink a&#8217; th&#8217; body—</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MEN.</speaker>
<line offset="6">Well, what then?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. ROM. CIT.</speaker>
<line>The former agents, if they did complain,</line>
<line>What could the belly answer?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MEN.</speaker>
<line offset="6">I will tell you;</line>
<line>If You&#8217;ll bestow a small (of what you have little)</line>
<line>Patience awhile, you&#8217;st hear the belly&#8217;s answer.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. ROM. CIT.</speaker>
<line>Y&#8217; are long about it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MEN.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Note me this, good friend:</line>
<line>Your most grave belly was deliberate,</line>
<line>Not rash like his accusers, and thus answered:</line>
<line>&#8220;True is it, my incorporate friends,&#8221; quoth he,</line>
<line>&#8220;That I receive the general food at first</line>
<line>Which you do live upon; and fit it is,</line>
<line>Because I am the store-house and the shop</line>
<line>Of the whole body. But, if you do remember,</line>
<line>I send it through the rivers of your blood,</line>
<line>Even to the court, the heart, to th&#8217; seat o&#8217; th&#8217; brain,</line>
<line>And, through the cranks and offices of man,</line>
<line>The strongest nerves and small inferior veins</line>
<line>From me receive that natural competency</line>
<line>Whereby they live. And though that all at once&#8221;&#8212;</line>
<line>You, my good friends, this says the belly, mark me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. ROM. CIT.</speaker>
<line>Ay, sir, well, well.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MEN.</speaker>
<line offset="4">&#8220;Though all at once cannot</line>
<line>See what I do deliver out to each,</line>
<line>Yet I can make my audit up, that all</line>
<line>From me do back receive the flour of all,</line>
<line>And leave me but the bran.&#8221; What say you to&#8217;t?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. ROM. CIT.</speaker>
<line>It was an answer. How apply you this?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MEN.</speaker>
<line>The senators of Rome are this good belly,</line>
<line>And you the mutinous members: for examine</line>
<line>Their counsels and their cares; digest things rightly</line>
<line>Touching the weal a&#8217; th&#8217; common, you shall find</line>
<line>No public benefit which you receive</line>
<line>But it proceeds or comes from them to you,</line>
<line>And no way from yourselves. What do you think,</line>
<line>You, the great toe of this assembly?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. ROM. CIT.</speaker>
<line>I the great toe? Why the great toe?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MEN.</speaker>
<line>For that, being one o&#8217; th&#8217; lowest, basest, poorest</line>
<line>Of this most wise rebellion, thou goest foremost;</line>
<line>Thou rascal, that art worst in blood to run,</line>
<line>Lead&#8217;st first to win some vantage.</line>
<line>But make you ready your stiff bats and clubs,</line>
<line>Rome and her rats are at the point of battle,</line>
<line>The one side must have bale.</line>

<stagedir>Enter Caius Martius.</stagedir>

<line offset="6">Hail, noble Martius!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MAR.</speaker>
<line>Thanks. What&#8217;s the matter, you dissentious rogues,</line>
<line>That rubbing the poor itch of your opinion</line>
<line>Make yourselves scabs?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. ROM. CIT.</speaker>
<line>We have ever your good word.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MAR.</speaker>
<line>He that will give good words to thee will flatter</line>
<line>Beneath abhorring. What would you have, you curs,</line>
<line>That like nor peace nor war? The one affrights you,</line>
<line>The other makes you proud. He that trusts to you,</line>
<line>Where he should find you lions, finds you hares;</line>
<line>Where foxes, geese. You are no surer, no,</line>
<line>Than is the coal of fire upon the ice,</line>
<line>Or hailstone in the sun. Your virtue is</line>
<line>To make him worthy whose offense subdues him,</line>
<line>And curse that justice did it. Who deserves greatness</line>
<line>Deserves your hate; and your affections are</line>
<line>A sick man&#8217;s appetite, who desires most that</line>
<line>Which would increase his evil. He that depends</line>
<line>Upon your favors swims with fins of lead,</line>
<line>And hews down oaks with rushes. Hang ye! Trust ye?</line>
<line>With every minute you do change a mind,</line>
<line>And call him noble, that was now your hate;</line>
<line>Him vild, that was your garland. What&#8217;s the matter,</line>
<line>That in these several places of the city</line>
<line>You cry against the noble Senate, who</line>
<line>(Under the gods) keep you in awe, which else</line>
<line>Would feed on one another? What&#8217;s their seeking?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MEN.</speaker>
<line>For corn at their own rates, whereof they say</line>
<line>The city is well stor&#8217;d.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MAR.</speaker>
<line offset="5">Hang &#8217;em! They say?</line>
<line>They&#8217;ll sit by th&#8217; fire, and presume to know</line>
<line>What&#8217;s done i&#8217; th&#8217; Capitol; who&#8217;s like to rise,</line>
<line>Who thrives, and who declines; side factions, and give out</line>
<line>Conjectural marriages, making parties strong,</line>
<line>And feebling such as stand not in their liking</line>
<line>Below their cobbled shoes. They say there&#8217;s grain enough?</line>
<line>Would the nobility lay aside their ruth</line>
<line>And let me use my sword, I&#8217;d make a quarry</line>
<line>With thousands of these quarter&#8217;d slaves, as high</line>
<line>As I could pick my lance.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MEN.</speaker>
<line>Nay, these are almost thoroughly persuaded;</line>
<line>For though abundantly they lack discretion,</line>
<line>Yet are they passing cowardly. But I beseech you,</line>
<line>What says the other troop?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MAR.</speaker>
<line offset="5">They are dissolv&#8217;d. Hang &#8217;em!</line>
<line>They said they were an-hungry; sigh&#8217;d forth proverbs—</line>
<line>That hunger broke stone walls, that dogs must eat,</line>
<line>That meat was made for mouths, that the gods sent not</line>
<line>Corn for the rich men only. With these shreds</line>
<line>They vented their complainings, which being answer&#8217;d,</line>
<line>And a petition granted them—a strange one,</line>
<line>To break the heart of generosity</line>
<line>And make bold power look pale—they threw their caps</line>
<line>As they would hang them on the horns a&#8217; th&#8217; moon,</line>
<line>Shouting their emulation.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MEN.</speaker>
<line offset="5">What is granted them?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MAR.</speaker>
<line>Five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms,</line>
<line>Of their own choice. One&#8217;s Junius Brutus,</line>
<line>Sicinius Velutus, and I know not—&#8217;sdeath,</line>
<line>The rabble should have first unroof&#8217;d the city</line>
<line>Ere so prevail&#8217;d with me; it will in time</line>
<line>Win upon power, and throw forth greater themes</line>
<line>For insurrection&#8217;s arguing.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MEN.</speaker>
<line offset="5">This is strange.</line>
</speech>

<line offset="5">They have a leader,</line>
<line>Tullus Aufidius, that will put you to&#8217;t.</line>

<line offset="5">Such a nature,</line>

<speech>
<speaker>VOL.</speaker>
<line>I pray you, daughter, sing, or express yourself in a more comfortable sort. If my son were my husband, I should freelier rejoice in that absence wherein he won honor than in the embracements of his bed where he would show most love. When yet he was but tender-bodied and the only son of my womb; when youth with comeliness pluck&#8217;d all gaze his way; when for a day of kings&#8217; entreaties a mother should not sell him an hour from her beholding; I, considering how honor would become such a person, that it was no better than picture-like to hang by th&#8217; wall, if renown made it not stir, was pleas&#8217;d to let him seek danger where he was like to find fame. To a cruel war I sent him, from whence he return&#8217;d, his brows bound with oak. I tell thee, daughter, I sprang not more in joy at first hearing he was a man-child than now in first seeing he had prov&#8217;d himself a man.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VIR.</speaker>
<line>But had he died in the business, madam, how then?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VOL.</speaker>
<line>Then his good report should have been my son; I therein would have found issue. Hear me profess sincerely; had I a dozen sons, each in my love alike, and none less dear than thine and my good Martius, I had rather had eleven die nobly for their country than one voluptuously surfeit out of action.</line>

<line>Indeed you shall not.</line>

<line>Methinks I see him stamp thus, and call thus:</line>
<line>&#8220;Come on, you cowards, you were got in fear,</line>
<line>Though you were born in Rome!&#8221; His bloody brow</line>
<line>With his mail&#8217;d hand then wiping, forth he goes,</line>

<line>Sweet madam.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VIR.</speaker>
<line>I am glad to see your ladyship.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>How do you both? You are manifest house-keepers. What are you sewing here? A fine spot, in good faith. How does your little son?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VIR.</speaker>
<line>I thank your ladyship; well, good madam.</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>A&#8217; my word, the father&#8217;s son. I&#8217;ll swear &#8217;tis a very pretty boy. A&#8217; my troth, I look&#8217;d upon him a&#8217; We&#8217;n&#8217;sday half an hour together; h&#8217;as such a confirm&#8217;d countenance. I saw him run after a gilded butterfly, and when he caught it, he let it go again, and after it again, and over and over he comes, and up again; catch&#8217;d it again: or whether his fallen rag&#8217;d him, or how &#8217;twas, he did so set his teeth and tear it. O, I warrant, how he mammock&#8217;d it!</line>

<speech>

<line>One on &#8217;s father&#8217;s moods.</line>

<speech>

<line>A crack, madam.</line>
</speech>

<speech>

<line>Come, lay aside your stitchery, I must have you play the idle huswife with me this afternoon.</line>

<line>You would be another Penelope: yet they say, all the yarn she spun in Ulysses&#8217; absence did but fill Ithaca full of moths. Come, I would your cambric were sensible as your finger, that you might leave pricking it for pity. Come, you shall go with us.</line>

<speech>

<line>No, good madam, pardon me, indeed I will not forth.</line>

<line>In truth la, go with me, and I&#8217;ll tell you excellent news of your husband.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>VIR.</speaker>
<line>O, good madam, there can be none yet.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>Verily, I do not jest with you; there came news from him last night.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VIR.</speaker>
<line>Indeed, madam?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VAL.</speaker>
<line>In earnest, it&#8217;s true; I heard a senator speak it. Thus it is: the Volsces have an army forth; against whom Cominius the general is gone, with one part of our Roman power. Your lord and Titus Lartius are set down before their city Corioles; they nothing doubt prevailing, and to make it brief wars. This is true, on mine honor, and so I pray go with us.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VIR.</speaker>
<line>Give me excuse, good madam, I will obey you in every thing hereafter.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VOL.</speaker>
<line>Let her alone, lady; as she is now, she will but disease our better mirth.</line>

<speech>

<line>In troth, I think she would. Fare you well then. Come, good sweet lady. Prithee, Virgilia, turn thy solemnness out a&#8217; door, and go along with us.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>VIR.</speaker>
<line>No, at a word, madam; indeed I must not.</line>
<line>I wish you much mirth.</line>

<line>All the contagion of the south light on you,</line>

When you are hearing a matter between party and party, if you chance to be pinch&#8217;d with the colic, you make faces like mummers, set up the bloody flag against all patience, and in roaring for a chamber-pot, dismiss the controversy bleeding, the more entangled by your hearing.

When you speak best unto the purpose, it is not worth the wagging of your beards, and your beards deserve not so honorable a grave as to stuff a botcher&#8217;s cushion, or to be entomb&#8217;d in an ass&#8217;s pack-saddle. Yet you must be saying Martius is proud; who, in a cheap estimation, is worth all your predecessors since Deucalion, though peradventure some of the best of &#8217;em were hereditary hangmen. God-den to your worships; more of your conversation would infect my brain, being the herdsmen of the beastly plebeians. I will be bold to take my leave of you.</line>

<line>Come, come, they are almost here. How many stand for consulships?</line>

<speech>
<speaker>2. OFF.</speaker>
<line>Three, they say; but &#8217;tis thought of every one Coriolanus will carry it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. OFF.</speaker>
<line>That&#8217;s a brave fellow; but he&#8217;s vengeance proud, and loves not the common people.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. OFF.</speaker>
<line>Faith, there hath been many great men that have flatter&#8217;d the people, who ne&#8217;er lov&#8217;d them; and there be many that they have lov&#8217;d, they know not wherefore; so that, if they love they know not why, they hate upon no better a ground. Therefore, for Coriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate him manifests the true knowledge he has in their disposition, and out of his noble carelessness lets them plainly see&#8217;t.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. OFF.</speaker>
<line>If he did not care whether he had their love or no, he wav&#8217;d indifferently &#8217;twixt doing them neither good nor harm; but he seeks their hate with greater devotion than they can render it him, and leaves nothing undone that may fully discover him their opposite. Now, to seem to affect the malice and displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he dislikes, to flatter them for their love.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. OFF.</speaker>
<line>He hath deserv&#8217;d worthily of his country, and his ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who, having been supple and courteous to the people, bonneted, without any further deed to have them at all into their estimation and report. But he hath so planted his honors in their eyes and his actions in their hearts that for their tongues to be silent and not confess so much were a kind of ingrateful injury; to report otherwise were a malice that, giving itself the lie, would pluck reproof and rebuke from every ear that heard it.</line>

<speaker>COM.</speaker>
<line>I shall lack voice: the deeds of Coriolanus</line>
<line>Should not be utter&#8217;d feebly. It is held</line>
<line>That valor is the chiefest virtue, and</line>
<line>Most dignifies the haver; if it be,</line>
<line>The man I speak of cannot in the world</line>
<line>Be singly counterpois&#8217;d. At sixteen years,</line>
<line>When Tarquin made a head for Rome, he fought</line>
<line>Beyond the mark of others. Our then dictator,</line>
<line>Whom with all praise I point at, saw him fight,</line>
<line>When with his Amazonian chin he drove</line>
<line>The bristled lips before him. He bestrid</line>
<line>An o&#8217;erpress&#8217;d Roman, and i&#8217; th&#8217; consul&#8217;s view</line>
<line>Slew three opposers. Tarquin&#8217;s self he met,</line>
<line>And struck him on his knee. In that day&#8217;s feats,</line>
<line>When he might act the woman in the scene,</line>
<line>He prov&#8217;d best man i&#8217; th&#8217; field, and for his meed</line>
<line>Was brow-bound with the oak. His pupil age</line>
<line>Man-ent&#8217;red thus, he waxed like a sea,</line>
<line>And in the brunt of seventeen battles since</line>
<line>He lurch&#8217;d all swords of the garland. For this last,</line>
<line>Before and in Corioles, let me say,</line>
<line>I cannot speak him home. He stopp&#8217;d the fliers,</line>
<line>And by his rare example made the coward</line>
<line>Turn terror into sport; as weeds before</line>
<line>A vessel under sail, so men obey&#8217;d</line>
<line>And fell below his stem. His sword, death&#8217;s stamp,</line>
<line>Where it did mark, it took; from face to foot</line>
<line>He was a thing of blood, whose every motion</line>
<line>Was tim&#8217;d with dying cries. Alone he ent&#8217;red</line>

<line>His ready sense; then straight his doubled spirit</line>
<line>Requick&#8217;ned what in flesh was fatigate,</line>
<line>And to the battle came he, where he did</line>
<line>Run reeking o&#8217;er the lives of men, as if</line>

<stagedir>Enter seven or eight Roman Citizens.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>1. ROM. CIT.</speaker>
<line>Once if he do require our voices, we ought not to deny him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. ROM. CIT.</speaker>
<line>We may, sir, if we will.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>3. ROM. CIT.</speaker>
<line>We have power in ourselves to do it, but it is a power that we have no power to do; for if he show us his wounds and tell us his deeds, we are to put our tongues into those wounds and speak for them; so, if he tell us his noble deeds, we must also tell him our noble acceptance of them. Ingratitude is monstrous, and for the multitude to be ingrateful were to make a monster of the multitude; of the which we being members, should bring ourselves to be monstrous members.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. ROM. CIT.</speaker>
<line>And to make us no better thought of, a little help will serve; for once we stood up about the corn, he himself stuck not to call us the many-headed multitude.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>3. ROM. CIT.</speaker>
<line>We have been call&#8217;d so of many, not that our heads are some brown, some black, some abram, some bald, but that our wits are so diversely color&#8217;d; and truly I think if all our wits were to issue out of one skull, they would fly east, west, north, south, and their consent of one direct way should be at once to all the points a&#8217; th&#8217; compass.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. ROM. CIT.</speaker>
<line>Think you so? Which way do you judge my wit would fly?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>3. ROM. CIT.</speaker>
<line>Nay, your wit will not so soon out as another man&#8217;s will; &#8217;tis strongly wadg&#8217;d up in a block-head; but if it were at liberty, &#8217;twould sure southward.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. ROM. CIT.</speaker>
<line>Why that way?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>3. ROM. CIT.</speaker>
<line>To lose itself in a fog, where being three parts melted away with rotten dews, the fourth would return for conscience&#8217; sake to help to get thee a wife.</line>

<line>You are never without your tricks; you may, you may.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>3. ROM. CIT.</speaker>
<line>Are you all resolv&#8217;d to give your voices? But that&#8217;s no matter, the greater part carries it, I say. If he would incline to the people, there was never a worthier man.</line>

<stagedir>Enter Coriolanus in a gown of humility, with Menenius.</stagedir>
<line>Here he comes, and in the gown of humility, mark his behavior. We are not to stay all together, but to come by him where he stands, by ones, by twos, and by threes. He&#8217;s to make his requests by particulars, wherein every one of us has a single honor, in giving him our own voices with our own tongues; therefore follow me, and I&#8217;ll direct you how you shall go by him.</line>

<line>Well then, I pray, your price a&#8217; th&#8217; consulship?</line>

<line>Pray you now, if it may stand with the tune of your voices that I may be consul, I have here the customary gown.</line>

<line>Your enigma?</line>

<line>You should account me the more virtuous that I have not been common in my love. I will, sir, flatter my sworn brother, the people, to earn a dearer estimation of them; &#8217;tis a condition they account gentle. And since the wisdom of their choice is rather to have my hat than my heart, I will practice the insinuating nod and be off to them most counterfeitly; that is, sir, I will counterfeit the bewitchment of some popular man, and give it bountiful to the desirers. Therefore beseech you I may be consul.</line>

<line>Most sweet voices!</line>
<line>Better it is to die, better to starve,</line>

<line>Why in this woolvish toge should I stand here</line>
<line>To beg of Hob and Dick, that does appear,</line>
<line>Their needless vouches? Custom calls me to&#8217;t.</line>
<line>What custom wills, in all things should we do&#8217;t,</line>
<line>The dust on antique time would lie unswept,</line>
<line>And mountainous error be too highly heap&#8217;d</line>

<line>Not one amongst us, save yourself, but says</line>

<line>He was your enemy, ever spake against</line>
<line>Your liberties and the charters that you bear</line>
<line>I&#8217; th&#8217; body of the weal; and now, arriving</line>
<line>A place of potency and sway o&#8217; th&#8217; state,</line>
<line>If he should still malignantly remain</line>
<line>Fast foe to th&#8217; plebeii, your voices might</line>
<line>Be curses to yourselves? You should have said</line>

<line>Either his gracious promise, which you might,</line>

<line>Or else it would have gall&#8217;d his surly nature,</line>
<line>Which easily endures not article</line>
<line>Tying him to aught; so putting him to rage,</line>
<line>You should have ta&#8217;en th&#8217; advantage of his choler,</line>

<line>Th&#8217; apprehension of his present portance,</line>

<line>You had more beard when I last saw you, but your favor is well appear&#8217;d by your tongue. What&#8217;s the news in Rome? I have a note from the Volscian state to find you out there. You have well sav&#8217;d me a day&#8217;s journey.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>NIC.</speaker>
<line>There hath been in Rome strange insurrections; the people against the senators, patricians, and nobles.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ADR.</speaker>
<line>Hath been! Is it ended then? Our state thinks not so; they are in a most warlike preparation, and hope to come upon them in the heat of their division.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NIC.</speaker>
<line>The main blaze of it is past, but a small thing would make it flame again; for the nobles receive so to heart the banishment of that worthy Coriolanus, that they are in a ripe aptness to take all power from the people, and to pluck from them their tribunes forever. This lies glowing, I can tell you, and is almost mature for the violent breaking out.</line>

<line>I shall, between this and supper, tell you most strange things from Rome, all tending to the good of their adversaries. Have you an army ready, say you?</line>

Our general himself makes a mistress of him, sanctifies himself with &#8217;s hand, and turns up the white o&#8217; th&#8217; eye to his discourse. But the bottom of the news is, our general is cut i&#8217; th&#8217; middle, and but one half of what he was yesterday; for the other has half by the entreaty and grant of the whole table. He&#8217;ll go, he says, and sowl the porter of Rome gates by th&#8217; ears. He will mow all down before him, and leave his passage poll&#8217;d.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>2. SERV.</speaker>
<line>And he&#8217;s as like to do&#8217;t as any man I can imagine.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>3. SERV.</speaker>
<line>Do&#8217;t? He will do&#8217;t; for look you, sir, he has as many friends as enemies; which friends, sir, as it were, durst not (look you, sir) show themselves (as we term it) his friends whilest he&#8217;s in directitude.</line>

<line>Directitude? What&#8217;s that?</line>

<speech>
<speaker>3. SERV.</speaker>
<line>But when they shall see, sir, his crest up again and the man in blood, they will out of their burrows, like conies after rain, and revel all with him.</line>

<speaker>1. SERV.</speaker>
<line>But when goes this forward?</line>

<speech>

<line>Tomorrow, today, presently; you shall have the drum strook up this afternoon. &#8217;Tis, as it were, a parcel of their feast, and to be executed ere they wipe their lips.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. SERV.</speaker>
<line>Why then we shall have a stirring world again. This peace is nothing but to rust iron, increase tailors, and breed ballad-makers.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. SERV.</speaker>
<line>Let me have war, say I, it exceeds peace as far as day does night; it&#8217;s sprightly, waking, audible, and full of vent. Peace is a very apoplexy, lethargy, mull&#8217;d, deaf, sleepy, insensible, a getter of more bastard children than war&#8217;s a destroyer of men.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>2. SERV.</speaker>
<line>&#8217;Tis so, and as wars, in some sort, may be said to be a ravisher, so it cannot be denied but peace is a great maker of cuckolds.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. SERV.</speaker>
<line>Ay, and it makes men hate one another.</line>
</speech>

<speech>

<line>The senators and patricians love him too;</line>
<line>The tribunes are no soldiers, and their people</line>

<line>By sovereignty of nature. First he was</line>
<line>A noble servant to them, but he could not</line>

<line>Which out of daily fortune ever taints</line>
<line>The happy man; whether defect of judgment,</line>
<line>To fail in the disposing of those chances</line>
<line>Which he was lord of; or whether nature,</line>
<line>Not to be other than one thing, not moving</line>
<line>From th&#8217; casque to th&#8217; cushion, but commanding peace</line>

<line>So hated, and so banish&#8217;d; but he has a merit</line>
<line>To choke it in the utt&#8217;rance. So our virtues</line>
<line>Lie in th&#8217; interpretation of the time,</line>
<line>And power, unto itself most commendable,</line>
<line>Hath not a tomb so evident as a chair</line>
<line>T&#8217; extol what it hath done.</line>

<line>As poisonous of your honor. No, our suit</line>
<line>Is that you reconcile them: while the Volsces</line>
<line>May say, &#8220;This mercy we have show&#8217;d,&#8221; the Romans,</line>
<line>&#8220;This we receiv&#8217;d&#8221;; and each in either side</line>
<line>Give the all-hail to thee, and cry, &#8220;Be blest</line>
<line>For making up this peace!&#8221; Thou know&#8217;st, great son,</line>
<line>The end of war&#8217;s uncertain; but this certain,</line>
<line>That, if thou conquer Rome, the benefit</line>
<line>Which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name</line>
<line>Whose repetition will be dogg&#8217;d with curses;</line>
<line>Whose chronicle thus writ: &#8220;The man was noble,</line>
<line>But with his last attempt he wip&#8217;d it out,</line>
<line>Destroy&#8217;d his country, and his name remains</line>
<line>To th&#8217; ensuing age abhorr&#8217;d.&#8221; Speak to me, son.</line>
<line>Thou hast affected the fine strains of honor,</line>
<line>To imitate the graces of the gods:</line>
<line>To tear with thunder the wide cheeks a&#8217; th&#8217; air,</line>
<line>And yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt</line>
<line>That should but rive an oak. Why dost not speak?</line>
<line>Think&#8217;st thou it honorable for a noble man</line>
<line>Still to remember wrongs? Daughter, speak you;</line>
<line>He cares not for your weeping. Speak thou, boy;</line>
<line>Perhaps thy childishness will move him more</line>
<line>Than can our reasons. There&#8217;s no man in the world</line>
<line>More bound to &#8217;s mother, yet here he lets me prate</line>
<line>Like one i&#8217; th&#8217; stocks.&#8212;Thou hast never in thy life</line>
<line>Show&#8217;d thy dear mother any courtesy,</line>
<line>When she, poor hen, fond of no second brood,</line>
<line>Has cluck&#8217;d thee to the wars, and safely home</line>
<line>Loaden with honor. Say my request&#8217;s unjust,</line>
<line>And spurn me back; but if it be not so,</line>
<line>Thou art not honest, and the gods will plague thee</line>
<line>That thou restrain&#8217;st from me the duty which</line>
<line>To a mother&#8217;s part belongs.&#8212;He turns away.</line>
<line>Down, ladies; let us shame him with our knees.</line>
<line>To his surname Coriolanus &#8217;longs more pride</line>
<line>Than pity to our prayers. Down! An end,</line>
<line>This is the last. So, we will home to Rome,</line>
<line>And die among our neighbors.&#8212;Nay, behold &#8217;s!</line>
<line>This boy, that cannot tell what he would have,</line>
<line>But kneels and holds up hands for fellowship,</line>
<line>Does reason our petition with more strength</line>
<line>Than thou hast to deny&#8217;t.&#8212;Come, let us go.</line>
<line>This fellow had a Volscian to his mother;</line>
<line>His wife is in Corioles, and his child</line>
<line>Like him by chance.&#8212;Yet give us our dispatch.</line>
