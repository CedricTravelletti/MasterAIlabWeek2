<scenepersonae>(Orlando, Adam, Oliver, Dennis, Charles)</scenepersonae>

<stagedir>Enter Orlando and Adam.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>ORL.</speaker>
<line>As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion bequeath&#8217;d me by will but poor a thousand crowns, and, as thou say&#8217;st, charg&#8217;d my brother, on his blessing, to breed me well; and there begins my sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and report speaks goldenly of his profit. For my part, he keeps me rustically at home, or (to speak more properly) stays me here at home unkept; for call you that keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses are bred better, for besides that they are fair with their feeding, they are taught their manage, and to that end riders dearly hir&#8217;d; but I (his brother) gain nothing under him but growth, for the which his animals on his dunghills are as much bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave me his countenance seems to take from me. He lets me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a brother, and as much as in him lies, mines my gentility with my education. This is it, Adam, that grieves me, and the spirit of my father, which I think is within me, begins to mutiny against this servitude. I will no longer endure it, though yet I know no wise remedy how to avoid it.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Oliver.</stagedir>
 
<speech>
<speaker>ADAM.</speaker>
<line>Yonder comes my master, your brother.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ORL.</speaker>
<line>Go apart, Adam, and thou shalt hear how he will shake me up.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OLI.</speaker>
<line>Now, sir, what make you here?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ORL.</speaker>
<line>Nothing. I am not taught to make any thing.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OLI.</speaker>
<line>What mar you then, sir?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ORL.</speaker>
<line>Marry, sir, I am helping you to mar that which God made, a poor unworthy brother of yours, with idleness.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OLI.</speaker>
<line>Marry, sir, be better employ&#8217;d, and be naught a while.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ORL.</speaker>
<line>Shall I keep your hogs and eat husks with them? What prodigal portion have I spent, that I should come to such penury?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OLI.</speaker>
<line>Know you where you are, sir?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ORL.</speaker>
<line>O, sir, very well; here in your orchard.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OLI.</speaker>
<line>Know you before whom, sir?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ORL.</speaker>
<line>Ay, better than him I am before knows me. I know you are my eldest brother, and in the gentle condition of blood you should so know me. The courtesy of nations allows you my better, in that you are the first born, but the same tradition takes not away my blood, were there twenty brothers betwixt us. I have as much of my father in me as you, albeit I confess your coming before me is nearer to his reverence.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OLI.</speaker>
<line>What, boy!</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Strikes him.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>ORL.</speaker>
<line>Come, come, elder brother, you are too young in this.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Collaring him.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>OLI.</speaker>
<line>Wilt thou lay hands on me, villain?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ORL.</speaker>
<line>I am no villain; I am the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys. He was my father, and he is thrice a villain that says such a father begot villains. Wert thou not my brother, I would not take this hand from thy throat till this other had pull&#8217;d out thy tongue for saying so. Thou hast rail&#8217;d on thyself.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ADAM.</speaker>
<line>Sweet masters, be patient, for your father&#8217;s remembrance, be at accord.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OLI.</speaker>
<line>Let me go, I say.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ORL.</speaker>
<line>I will not till I please. You shall hear me. My father charg&#8217;d you in his will to give me good education. You have train&#8217;d me like a peasant, obscuring and hiding from me all gentleman-like qualities. The spirit of my father grows strong in me, and I will no longer endure it; therefore allow me such exercises as may become a gentleman, or give me the poor allottery my father left me by testament, with that I will go buy my fortunes.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OLI.</speaker>
<line>And what wilt thou do? Beg, when that is spent? Well, sir, get you in. I will not long be troubled with you; you shall have some part of your will. I pray you leave me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ORL.</speaker>
<line>I will no further offend you than becomes me for my good.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OLI.</speaker>
<line>Get you with him, you old dog.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ADAM.</speaker>
<line>Is &#8220;old dog&#8221; my reward? Most true, I have lost my teeth in your service. God be with my old master, he would not have spoke such a word.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exeunt Orlando, Adam.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>OLI.</speaker>
<line>Is it even so? Begin you to grow upon me? I will physic your rankness, and yet give no thousand crowns neither. Holla, Dennis!</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Dennis.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>DEN.</speaker>
<line>Calls your worship?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OLI.</speaker>
<line>Was not Charles, the Duke&#8217;s wrastler, here to speak with me?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DEN.</speaker>
<line>So please you, he is here at the door, and importunes access to you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OLI.</speaker>
<line>Call him in.</line>

<stagedir>Exit Dennis.</stagedir>
<line>&#8217;Twill be a good way; and tomorrow the wrastling is.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Charles.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>CHA.</speaker>
<line>Good morrow to your worship.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OLI.</speaker>
<line>Good Monsieur Charles, what&#8217;s the new news at the new court?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CHA.</speaker>
<line>There&#8217;s no news at the court, sir, but the old news: that is, the old Duke is banish&#8217;d by his younger brother the new Duke, and three or four loving lords have put themselves into voluntary exile with him, whose lands and revenues enrich the new Duke; therefore he gives them good leave to wander.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OLI.</speaker>
<line>Can you tell if Rosalind, the Duke&#8217;s daughter, be banish&#8217;d with her father?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CHA.</speaker>
<line>O no; for the Duke&#8217;s daughter, her cousin, so loves her, being ever from their cradles bred together, that she would have follow&#8217;d her exile, or have died to stay behind her. She is at the court, and no less belov&#8217;d of her uncle than his own daughter, and never two ladies lov&#8217;d as they do.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OLI.</speaker>
<line>Where will the old Duke live?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CHA.</speaker>
<line>They say he is already in the forest of Arden, and a many merry men with him; and there they live like the old Robin Hood of England. They say many young gentlemen flock to him every day, and fleet the time carelessly, as they did in the golden world.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OLI.</speaker>
<line>What, you wrastle tomorrow before the new Duke?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CHA.</speaker>
<line>Marry, do I, sir; and I came to acquaint you with a matter. I am given, sir, secretly to understand that your younger brother, Orlando, hath a disposition to come in disguis&#8217;d against me to try a fall. Tomorrow, sir, I wrastle for my credit, and he that escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him well. Your brother is but young and tender, and for your love I would be loath to foil him, as I must for my own honor if he come in; therefore out of my love to you, I came hither to acquaint you withal, that either you might stay him from his intendment, or brook such disgrace well as he shall run into, in that it is a thing of his own search, and altogether against my will.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>OLI.</speaker>
<line>Charles, I thank thee for thy love to me, which thou shalt find I will most kindly requite. I had myself notice of my brother&#8217;s purpose herein, and have by underhand means labor&#8217;d to dissuade him from it; but he is resolute. I&#8217;ll tell thee, Charles, it is the stubbornest young fellow of France, full of ambition, an envious emulator of every man&#8217;s good parts, a secret and villainous contriver against me his natural brother; therefore use thy discretion&#8212; I had as lief thou didst break his neck as his finger. And thou wert best look to&#8217;t; for if thou dost him any slight disgrace, or if he do not mightily grace himself on thee, he will practice against thee by poison, entrap thee by some treacherous device, and never leave thee till he hath ta&#8217;en thy life by some indirect means or other; for I assure thee (and almost with tears I speak it) there is not one so young and so villainous this day living. I speak but brotherly of him, but should I anatomize him to thee as he is, I must blush and weep, and thou must look pale and wonder.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CHA.</speaker>
<line>I am heartily glad I came hither to you. If he come tomorrow, I&#8217;ll give him his payment. If ever he go alone again, I&#8217;ll never wrastle for prize more. And so God keep your worship!</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>OLI.</speaker>
<line>Farewell, good Charles. Now will I stir this gamester. I hope I shall see an end of him; for my soul (yet I know not why) hates nothing more than he. Yet he&#8217;s gentle, never school&#8217;d and yet learned, full of noble device, of all sorts enchantingly belov&#8217;d, and indeed so much in the heart of the world, and especially of my own people, who best know him, that I am altogether mispris&#8217;d. But it shall not be so long, this wrastler shall clear all. Nothing remains but that I kindle the boy thither, which now I&#8217;ll go about.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit.</stagedir>

<scenelocation>A lawn before the Duke&#8217;s palace.</scenelocation>
<scenepersonae>(Rosalind, Celia, Clown Touchstone, Le Beau, Duke Frederick, Lords, Orlando, Charles, Attendants)</scenepersonae>

<stagedir>Enter Rosalind and Celia.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>CEL.</speaker>
<line>I pray thee, Rosalind, sweet my coz, be merry.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>Dear Celia&#8212;I show more mirth than I am mistress of, and would you yet I were merrier? Unless you could teach me to forget a banish&#8217;d father, you must not learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CEL.</speaker>
<line>Herein I see thou lov&#8217;st me not with the full weight that I love thee. If my uncle, thy banish&#8217;d father, had banish&#8217;d thy uncle, the Duke my father, so thou hadst been still with me, I could have taught my love to take thy father for mine; so wouldst thou, if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously temper&#8217;d as mine is to thee.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>Well, I will forget the condition of my estate, to rejoice in yours.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CEL.</speaker>
<line>You know my father hath no child but I, nor none is like to have; and truly when he dies, thou shalt be his heir; for what he hath taken away from thy father perforce, I will render thee again in affection. By mine honor, I will, and when I break that oath, let me turn monster. Therefore, my sweet Rose, my dear Rose, be merry.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>From henceforth I will, coz, and devise sports. Let me see&#8212;what think you of falling in love?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CEL.</speaker>
<line>Marry, I prithee do, to make sport withal. But love no man in good earnest, nor no further in sport neither, than with safety of a pure blush thou mayst in honor come off again.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>What shall be our sport then?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CEL.</speaker>
<line>Let us sit and mock the good huswife Fortune from her wheel, that her gifts may henceforth be bestow&#8217;d equally.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>I would we could do so; for her benefits are mightily misplac&#8217;d, and the bountiful blind woman doth most mistake in her gifts to women.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CEL.</speaker>
<line>&#8217;Tis true, for those that she makes fair she scarce makes honest, and those that she makes honest she makes very ill-favoredly.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>Nay, now thou goest from Fortune&#8217;s office to Nature&#8217;s. Fortune reigns in gifts of the world, not in the lineaments of Nature.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Clown (Touchstone).</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>CEL.</speaker>
<line>No; when Nature hath made a fair creature, may she not by Fortune fall into the fire? Though Nature hath given us wit to flout at Fortune, hath not Fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>Indeed there is Fortune too hard for Nature, when Fortune makes Nature&#8217;s natural the cutter-off of Nature&#8217;s wit.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CEL.</speaker>
<line>Peradventure this is not Fortune&#8217;s work neither, but Nature&#8217;s, who perceiveth our natural wits too dull to reason of such goddesses, and hath sent this natural for our whetstone; for always the dullness of the fool is the whetstone of the wits. How now, wit, whither wander you?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TOUCH.</speaker>
<line>Mistress, you must come away to your father.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CEL.</speaker>
<line>Were you made the messenger?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TOUCH.</speaker>
<line>No, by mine honor, but I was bid to come for you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>Where learn&#8217;d you that oath, fool?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TOUCH.</speaker>
<line>Of a certain knight, that swore by his honor they were good pancakes, and swore by his honor the mustard was naught. Now I&#8217;ll stand to it, the pancakes were naught, and the mustard was good, and yet was not the knight forsworn.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CEL.</speaker>
<line>How prove you that, in the great heap of your knowledge?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>Ay, marry, now unmuzzle your wisdom.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TOUCH.</speaker>
<line>Stand you both forth now. Stroke your chins, and swear by your beards that I am a knave.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CEL.</speaker>
<line>By our beards (if we had them) thou art.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TOUCH.</speaker>
<line>By my knavery (if I had it) then I were. But if you swear by that that is not, you are not forsworn. No more was this knight, swearing by his honor, for he never had any; or if he had, he had sworn it away before ever he saw those pancakes or that mustard.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CEL.</speaker>
<line>Prithee, who is&#8217;t that thou mean&#8217;st?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TOUCH.</speaker>
<line>One that old Frederick, your father, loves.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CEL.</speaker>
<line>My father&#8217;s love is enough to honor him enough. Speak no more of him, You&#8217;ll be whipt for taxation one of these days.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TOUCH.</speaker>
<line>The more pity that fools may not speak wisely what wise men do foolishly.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CEL.</speaker>
<line>By my troth, thou sayest true; for since the little wit that fools have was silenc&#8217;d, the little foolery that wise men have makes a great show. Here comes Monsieur Le Beau.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Le Beau.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>With his mouth full of news.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CEL.</speaker>
<line>Which he will put on us, as pigeons feed their young.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>Then shall we be news-cramm&#8217;d.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CEL.</speaker>
<line>All the better; we shall be the more marketable. Bon jour, Monsieur Le Beau. What&#8217;s the news?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LE BEAU.</speaker>
<line>Fair princess, you have lost much good sport.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CEL.</speaker>
<line>Sport! Of what color?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LE BEAU.</speaker>
<line>What color, madam? How shall I answer you?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>As wit and fortune will.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TOUCH.</speaker>
<line>Or as the Destinies decrees.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CEL.</speaker>
<line>Well said&#8212;that was laid on with a trowel.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TOUCH.</speaker>
<line>Nay, if I keep not my rank&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>Thou losest thy old smell.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LE BEAU.</speaker>
<line>You amaze me, ladies. I would have told you of good wrastling, which you have lost the sight of.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>Yet tell us the manner of the wrastling.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LE BEAU.</speaker>
<line>I will tell you the beginning; and if it please your ladyships, you may see the end, for the best is yet to do, and here where you are, they are coming to perform it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CEL.</speaker>
<line>Well, the beginning, that is dead and buried.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LE BEAU.</speaker>
<line>There comes an old man and his three sons&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CEL.</speaker>
<line>I could match this beginning with an old tale.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LE BEAU.</speaker>
<line>Three proper young men, of excellent growth and presence.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>With bills on their necks, &#8220;Be it known unto all men by these presents.&#8221;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LE BEAU.</speaker>
<line>The eldest of the three wrastled with Charles, the Duke&#8217;s wrastler, which Charles in a moment threw him, and broke three of his ribs, that there is little hope of life in him. So he serv&#8217;d the second, and so the third. Yonder they lie, the poor old man, their father, making such pitiful dole over them that all the beholders take his part with weeping.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>Alas!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TOUCH.</speaker>
<line>But what is the sport, monsieur, that the ladies have lost?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LE BEAU.</speaker>
<line>Why, this that I speak of.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TOUCH.</speaker>
<line>Thus men may grow wiser every day. It is the first time that ever I heard breaking of ribs was sport for ladies.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CEL.</speaker>
<line>Or I, I promise thee.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>But is there any else longs to see this broken music in his sides? Is there yet another dotes upon rib-breaking? Shall we see this wrastling, cousin?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LE BEAU.</speaker>
<line>You must if you stay here, for here is the place appointed for the wrastling, and they are ready to perform it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CEL.</speaker>
<line>Yonder sure they are coming. Let us now stay and see it.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Flourish. Enter Duke Frederick, Lords, Orlando, Charles, and Attendants.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>DUKE F.</speaker>
<line>Come on. Since the youth will not be entreated, his own peril on his forwardness.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>Is yonder the man?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LE BEAU.</speaker>
<line>Even he, madam.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CEL.</speaker>
<line>Alas, he is too young! Yet he looks successfully.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUKE F.</speaker>
<line>How now, daughter and cousin? Are you crept hither to see the wrastling?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>Ay, my liege, so please you give us leave.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUKE F.</speaker>
<line>You will take little delight in it, I can tell you, there is such odds in the man. In pity of the challenger&#8217;s youth I would fain dissuade him, but he will not be entreated. Speak to him, ladies, see if you can move him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CEL.</speaker>
<line>Call him hither, good Monsieur Le Beau.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUKE F.</speaker>
<line>Do so; I&#8217;ll not be by.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LE BEAU.</speaker>
<line>Monsieur the challenger, the princess calls for you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ORL.</speaker>
<line>I attend them with all respect and duty.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>Young man, have you challeng&#8217;d Charles the wrastler?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ORL.</speaker>
<line>No, fair princess; he is the general challenger. I come but in, as others do, to try with him the strength of my youth.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CEL.</speaker>
<line>Young gentleman, your spirits are too bold for your years. You have seen cruel proof of this man&#8217;s strength. If you saw yourself with your eyes, or knew yourself with your judgment, the fear of your adventure would counsel you to a more equal enterprise. We pray you for your own sake to embrace your own safety, and give over this attempt.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>Do, young sir, your reputation shall not therefore be mispris&#8217;d. We will make it our suit to the Duke that the wrastling might not go forward.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ORL.</speaker>
<line>I beseech you, punish me not with your hard thoughts, wherein I confess me much guilty to deny so fair and excellent ladies any thing. But let your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my trial; wherein if I be foil&#8217;d, there is but one sham&#8217;d that was never gracious; if kill&#8217;d, but one dead that is willing to be so. I shall do my friends no wrong, for I have none to lament me; the world no injury, for in it I have nothing. Only in the world I fill up a place, which may be better supplied when I have made it empty.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>The little strength that I have, I would it were with you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CEL.</speaker>
<line>And mine, to eke out hers.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>Fare you well; pray heaven I be deceiv&#8217;d in you!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CEL.</speaker>
<line>Your heart&#8217;s desires be with you!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CHA.</speaker>
<line>Come, where is this young gallant that is so desirous to lie with his mother earth?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ORL.</speaker>
<line>Ready, sir, but his will hath in it a more modest working.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUKE F.</speaker>
<line>You shall try but one fall.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CHA.</speaker>
<line>No, I warrant your Grace, you shall not entreat him to a second, that have so mightily persuaded him from a first.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ORL.</speaker>
<line>You mean to mock me after; you should not have mock&#8217;d me before. But come your ways.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>Now Hercules be thy speed, young man!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CEL.</speaker>
<line>I would I were invisible, to catch the strong fellow by the leg.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Wrastle.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>O excellent young man!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CEL.</speaker>

<line>I am more proud to be Sir Rowland&#8217;s son,</line>

</speech>

<speech>

<line>My father lov&#8217;d Sir Rowland as his soul,</line>

<speaker>LE BEAU.</speaker>
<line>Good sir, I do in friendship counsel you</line>
<line>To leave this place. Albeit you have deserv&#8217;d</line>
<line>High commendation, true applause, and love,</line>
<line>Yet such is now the Duke&#8217;s condition</line>
<line>That he misconsters all that you have done.</line>
<line>The Duke is humorous&#8212; what he is indeed</line>
<line>More suits you to conceive than I to speak of.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ORL.</speaker>
<line>I thank you, sir; and pray you tell me this:</line>
<line>Which of the two was daughter of the Duke,</line>
<line>That here was at the wrastling?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LE BEAU.</speaker>
<line>Neither his daughter, if we judge by manners,</line>
<line>But yet indeed the smaller is his daughter.</line>
<line>The other is daughter to the banish&#8217;d Duke,</line>
<line>And here detain&#8217;d by her usurping uncle</line>
<line>To keep his daughter company, whose loves</line>
<line>Are dearer than the natural bond of sisters.</line>
<line>But I can tell you that of late this Duke</line>
<line>Hath ta&#8217;en displeasure &#8217;gainst his gentle niece,</line>
<line>Grounded upon no other argument</line>
<line>But that the people praise her for her virtues,</line>
<line>And pity her for her good father&#8217;s sake;</line>
<line>And on my life his malice &#8217;gainst the lady</line>
<line>Will suddenly break forth. Sir, fare you well.</line>
<line>Hereafter, in a better world than this,</line>
<line>I shall desire more love and knowledge of you.</line>

<line>I rest much bounden to you; fare you well.</line>

<line>I did not then entreat to have her stay,</line>

<line>That from the hunter&#8217;s aim had ta&#8217;en a hurt,</line>
<line>Did come to languish; and indeed, my lord,</line>
<line>The wretched animal heav&#8217;d forth such groans</line>
<line>That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat</line>
<line>Almost to bursting, and the big round tears</line>
<line>Cours&#8217;d one another down his innocent nose</line>
<line>In piteous chase; and thus the hairy fool,</line>

<line>As worldlings do, giving thy sum of more</line>
<line>To that which had too much.&#8221; Then being there alone,</line>
<line>Left and abandoned of his velvet friends</line>
<line>&#8220;&#8217;Tis right,&#8221; quoth he, &#8220;thus misery doth part</line>
<line>The flux of company.&#8221; Anon a careless herd,</line>
<line>Full of the pasture, jumps along by him</line>
<line>And never stays to greet him. &#8220;Ay,&#8221; quoth Jaques,</line>
<line>&#8220;Sweep on, you fat and greasy citizens,</line>
<line>&#8217;Tis just the fashion. Wherefore do you look</line>
<line>Upon that poor and broken bankrupt there?&#8221;</line>
<line>Thus most invectively he pierceth through</line>

<line>Yea, and of this our life, swearing that we</line>

<speaker>ADAM.</speaker>
<line offset="5">O unhappy youth,</line>
<line>Come not within these doors! Within this roof</line>
<line>The enemy of all your graces lives.</line>
<line>Your brother&#8212;no, no brother, yet the son</line>
<line>(Yet not the son, I will not call him son)</line>
<line>Of him I was about to call his father&#8212;</line>
<line>Hath heard your praises, and this night he means</line>
<line>To burn the lodging where you use to lie,</line>
<line>And you within it. If he fail of that,</line>
<line>He will have other means to cut you off;</line>
<line>I overheard him, and his practices.</line>
<line>This is no place, this house is but a butchery;</line>
<line>Abhor it, fear it, do not enter it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ORL.</speaker>
<line>Why, whither, Adam, wouldst thou have me go?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ADAM.</speaker>
<line>No matter whither, so you come not here.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ORL.</speaker>
<line>What, wouldst thou have me go and beg my food?</line>
<line>Or with a base and boist&#8217;rous sword enforce</line>
<line>A thievish living on the common road?</line>
<line>This I must do, or know not what to do;</line>
<line>Yet this I will not do, do how I can.</line>
<line>I rather will subject me to the malice</line>
<line>Of a diverted blood and bloody brother.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ADAM.</speaker>
<line>But do not so. I have five hundred crowns,</line>
<line>The thrifty hire I sav&#8217;d under your father,</line>
<line>Which I did store to be my foster-nurse,</line>
<line>When service should in my old limbs lie lame,</line>
<line>And unregarded age in corners thrown.</line>
<line>Take that, and He that doth the ravens feed,</line>
<line>Yea, providently caters for the sparrow,</line>
<line>Be comfort to my age! Here is the gold,</line>
<line>All this I give you, let me be your servant.</line>
<line>Though I look old, yet I am strong and lusty;</line>
<line>For in my youth I never did apply</line>
<line>Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood,</line>
<line>Nor did not with unbashful forehead woo</line>
<line>The means of weakness and debility;</line>
<line>Therefore my age is as a lusty winter,</line>
<line>Frosty, but kindly. Let me go with you,</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll do the service of a younger man</line>
<line>In all your business and necessities.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ORL.</speaker>
<line>O good old man, how well in thee appears</line>
<line>The constant service of the antique world,</line>
<line>When service sweat for duty, not for meed!</line>
<line>Thou art not for the fashion of these times,</line>
<line>Where none will sweat but for promotion,</line>
<line>And having that do choke their service up</line>
<line>Even with the having. It is not so with thee.</line>
<line>But, poor old man, thou prun&#8217;st a rotten tree,</line>
<line>That cannot so much as a blossom yield</line>
<line>In lieu of all thy pains and husbandry.</line>
<line>But come thy ways, we&#8217;ll go along together,</line>
<line>And ere we have thy youthful wages spent,</line>
<line>We&#8217;ll light upon some settled low content.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ADAM.</speaker>
<line>Master, go on, and I will follow thee</line>
<line>To the last gasp, with truth and loyalty.</line>
<line>From seventeen years till now almost fourscore</line>
<line>Here lived I, but now live here no more.</line>
<line>At seventeen years many their fortunes seek,</line>
<line>But at fourscore it is too late a week;</line>
<line>Yet fortune cannot recompense me better</line>
<line>Than to die well, and not my master&#8217;s debtor.</line>

<line>In good set terms, and yet a motley fool.</line>
<line>&#8220;Good morrow, fool,&#8221; quoth I. &#8220;No, sir,&#8221; quoth he,</line>

<line>&#8217;Tis but an hour ago since it was nine,</line>

<line>I almost die for food, and let me have it.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>DUKE S.</speaker>
<line>Sit down and feed, and welcome to our table.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ORL.</speaker>
<line>Speak you so gently? Pardon me, I pray you.</line>
<line>I thought that all things had been savage here,</line>
<line>And therefore put I on the countenance</line>
<line>Of stern command&#8217;ment. Bur what e&#8217;er you are</line>
<line>That in this desert inaccessible,</line>
<line>Under the shade of melancholy boughs,</line>
<line>Lose and neglect the creeping hours of time;</line>
<line>If ever you have look&#8217;d on better days,</line>
<line>If ever been where bells have knoll&#8217;d to church,</line>
<line>If ever sate at any good man&#8217;s feast,</line>
<line>If ever from your eyelids wip&#8217;d a tear,</line>
<line>And know what &#8217;tis to pity, and be pitied,</line>
<line>Let gentleness my strong enforcement be,</line>
<line>In the which hope I blush, and hide my sword.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUKE S.</speaker>
<line>True is it that we have seen better days,</line>
<line>And have with holy bell been knoll&#8217;d to church,</line>
<line>And sat at good men&#8217;s feasts, and wip&#8217;d our eyes</line>
<line>Of drops that sacred pity hath engend&#8217;red;</line>
<line>And therefore sit you down in gentleness,</line>
<line>And take upon command what help we have</line>
<line>That to your wanting may be minist&#8217;red.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ORL.</speaker>
<line>Then but forbear your food a little while,</line>
<line>Whiles, like a doe, I go to find my fawn,</line>
<line>And give it food. There is an old poor man,</line>
<line>Who after me hath many a weary step</line>
<line>Limp&#8217;d in pure love; till he be first suffic&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Oppress&#8217;d with two weak evils, age and hunger,</line>
<line>I will not touch a bit.</line>

<line>Thou seest we are not all alone unhappy:</line>
<line>This wide and universal theatre</line>
<line>Presents more woeful pageants than the scene</line>
<line>Wherein we play in.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JAQ.</speaker>
<line offset="4">All the world&#8217;s a stage,</line>
<line>And all the men and women merely players;</line>
<line>They have their exits and their entrances,</line>
<line>And one man in his time plays many parts,</line>
<line>His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,</line>
<line>Mewling and puking in the nurse&#8217;s arms.</line>
<line>Then the whining schoolboy, with his satchel</line>
<line>And shining morning face, creeping like snail</line>
<line>Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,</line>
<line>Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad</line>
<line>Made to his mistress&#8217; eyebrow. Then a soldier,</line>
<line>Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard,</line>
<line>Jealous in honor, sudden, and quick in quarrel,</line>
<line>Seeking the bubble reputation</line>
<line>Even in the cannon&#8217;s mouth. And then the justice,</line>
<line>In fair round belly with good capon lin&#8217;d,</line>
<line>With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,</line>
<line>Full of wise saws and modern instances;</line>
<line>And so he plays his part. The sixt age shifts</line>
<line>Into the lean and slipper&#8217;d pantaloon,</line>
<line>With spectacles on nose, and pouch on side,</line>
<line>His youthful hose, well sav&#8217;d, a world too wide</line>
<line>For his shrunk shank, and his big manly voice,</line>
<line>Turning again toward childish treble, pipes</line>
<line>And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,</line>
<line>That ends this strange eventful history,</line>
<line>Is second childishness, and mere oblivion,</line>
<line>Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans every thing.</line>

<stagedir>Enter Corin and Clown (Touchstone).</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>COR.</speaker>
<line>And how like you this shepherd&#8217;s life, Master Touchstone?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TOUCH.</speaker>
<line>Truly, shepherd, in respect of itself, it is a good life; but in respect that it is a shepherd&#8217;s life, it is naught. In respect that it is solitary, I like it very well; but in respect that it is private, it is a very vild life. Now in respect it is in the fields, it pleaseth me well; but in respect it is not in the court, it is tedious. As it is a spare life (look you) it fits my humor well; but as there is no more plenty in it, it goes much against my stomach. Hast any philosophy in thee, shepherd?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>COR.</speaker>
<line>No more but that I know the more one sickens the worse at ease he is; and that he that wants money, means, and content is without three good friends; that the property of rain is to wet and fire to burn; that good pasture makes fat sheep; and that a great cause of the night is lack of the sun; that he that hath learn&#8217;d no wit by nature, nor art, may complain of good breeding, or comes of a very dull kindred.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TOUCH.</speaker>
<line>Such a one is a natural philosopher. Wast ever in court, shepherd?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>COR.</speaker>
<line>No, truly.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TOUCH.</speaker>
<line>Then thou art damn&#8217;d.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>COR.</speaker>
<line>Nay, I hope.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TOUCH.</speaker>
<line>Truly, thou art damn&#8217;d, like an ill-roasted egg, all on one side.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>COR.</speaker>
<line>For not being at court? Your reason.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TOUCH.</speaker>
<line>Why, if thou never wast at court, thou never saw&#8217;st good manners; if thou never saw&#8217;st good manners, then thy manners must be wicked, and wickedness is sin, and sin is damnation. Thou art in a parlous state, shepherd.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>COR.</speaker>
<line>Not a whit, Touchstone. Those that are good manners at the court are as ridiculous in the country as the behavior of the country is most mockable at the court. You told me you salute not at the court but you kiss your hands; that courtesy would be uncleanly if courtiers were shepherds.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TOUCH.</speaker>
<line>Instance, briefly; come, instance.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>COR.</speaker>
<line>Why, we are still handling our ewes, and their fells you know are greasy.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TOUCH.</speaker>
<line>Why, do not your courtier&#8217;s hands sweat? And is not the grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of a man? Shallow, shallow. A better instance, I say; come.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>COR.</speaker>
<line>Besides, our hands are hard.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TOUCH.</speaker>
<line>Your lips will feel them the sooner. Shallow again. A more sounder instance, come.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>COR.</speaker>
<line>And they are often tarr&#8217;d over with the surgery of our sheep; and would you have us kiss tar? The courtier&#8217;s hands are perfum&#8217;d with civet.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TOUCH.</speaker>
<line>Most shallow man! Thou worm&#8217;s-meat, in respect of a good piece of flesh indeed! Learn of the wise, and perpend: civet is of a baser birth than tar, the very uncleanly flux of a cat. Mend the instance, shepherd.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>COR.</speaker>
<line>You have too courtly a wit for me, I&#8217;ll rest.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TOUCH.</speaker>
<line>Wilt thou rest damn&#8217;d? God help thee, shallow man! God make incision in thee, thou art raw.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>COR.</speaker>
<line>Sir, I am a true laborer: I earn that I eat, get that I wear, owe no man hate, envy no man&#8217;s happiness, glad of other men&#8217;s good, content with my harm, and the greatest of my pride is to see my ewes graze and my lambs suck.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TOUCH.</speaker>
<line>That is another simple sin in you, to bring the ewes and the rams together, and to offer to get your living by the copulation of cattle; to be bawd to a bell-wether, and to betray a she-lamb of a twelvemonth to a crooked-pated old cuckoldly ram, out of all reasonable match. If thou beest not damn&#8217;d for this, the devil himself will have no shepherds; I cannot see else how thou shouldst scape.</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TOUCH.</speaker>
<line>I&#8217;ll rhyme you so eight years together, dinners and suppers and sleeping-hours excepted. It is the right butter-women&#8217;s rank to market.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>Out, fool!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TOUCH.</speaker>
<line>For a taste:</line>
<line>If a hart do lack a hind,</line>
<line>Let him seek out Rosalind.</line>
<line>If the cat will after kind,</line>
<line>So be sure will Rosalind.</line>
<line>Wint&#8217;red garments must be lin&#8217;d,</line>
<line>So must slender Rosalind.</line>
<line>They that reap must sheaf and bind,</line>
<line>Then to cart with Rosalind.</line>
<line>Sweetest nut hath sourest rind,</line>
<line>Such a nut is Rosalind.</line>
<line>He that sweetest rose will find,</line>
<line>Must find love&#8217;s prick and Rosalind.</line>
<line>This is the very false gallop of verses; why do you infect yourself with them?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>Peace, you dull fool, I found them on a tree.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TOUCH.</speaker>
<line>Truly, the tree yields bad fruit.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>I&#8217;ll graff it with you, and then I shall graff it with a medlar. Then it will be the earliest fruit i&#8217; th&#8217; country; for You&#8217;ll be rotten ere you be half ripe, and that&#8217;s the right virtue of the medlar.</line>
</speech>

<line>You have said; but whether wisely or no, let the forest judge.</line>

<line>Didst thou hear these verses?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>O yes, I heard them all, and more too, for some of them had in them more feet than the verses would bear.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CEL.</speaker>
<line>That&#8217;s no matter; the feet might bear the verses.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>Ay, but the feet were lame, and could not bear themselves without the verse, and therefore stood lamely in the verse.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CEL.</speaker>
<line>But didst thou hear without wondering how thy name should be hang&#8217;d and carv&#8217;d upon these trees?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>I was seven of the nine days out of the wonder before you came; for look here what I found on a palm tree. I was never so berhym&#8217;d since Pythagoras&#8217; time, that I was an Irish rat, which I can hardly remember.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>I prithee who?</line>

<speech>

<line>O Lord, Lord, it is a hard matter for friends to meet; but mountains may be remov&#8217;d with earthquakes, and so encounter.</line>

<line>Nay, but who is it?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CEL.</speaker>
<line>Is it possible?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>Nay, I prithee now, with most petitionary vehemence, tell me who it is.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CEL.</speaker>
<line>O wonderful, wonderful, and most wonderful wonderful! And yet again wonderful, and after that, out of all hooping!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>Good my complexion, dost thou think, though I am caparison&#8217;d like a man, I have a doublet and hose in my disposition? One inch of delay more is a South-sea of discovery. I prithee tell me who is it quickly, and speak apace. I would thou couldst stammer, that thou mightst pour this conceal&#8217;d man out of thy mouth, as wine comes out of a narrow-mouth&#8217;d bottle, either too much at once, or none at all. I prithee take the cork out of thy mouth that I may drink thy tidings.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CEL.</speaker>
<line>So you may put a man in your belly.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>Is he of God&#8217;s making? What manner of man? Is his head worth a hat? Or his chin worth a beard?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CEL.</speaker>
<line>Nay, he hath but a little beard.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>Why, God will send more, if the man will be thankful. Let me stay the growth of his beard, if thou delay me not the knowledge of his chin.</line>

<line>Nay, but the devil take mocking. Speak sad brow and true maid.</line>

Where remains he? How parted he with thee? And when shalt thou see him again? Answer me in one word.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CEL.</speaker>
<line>You must borrow me Gargantua&#8217;s mouth first; &#8217;tis a word too great for any mouth of this age&#8217;s size. To say ay and no to these particulars is more than to answer in a catechism.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>But doth he know that I am in this forest and in man&#8217;s apparel? Looks he as freshly as he did the day he wrastled?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CEL.</speaker>
<line>It is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the propositions of a lover. But take a taste of my finding him, and relish it with good observance. I found him under a tree, like a dropp&#8217;d acorn.</line>

<line>I pray you mar no more trees with writing love-songs in their barks.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>JAQ.</speaker>
<line>Rosalind is your love&#8217;s name?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ORL.</speaker>
<line>Yes, just.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JAQ.</speaker>
<line>I do not like her name.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ORL.</speaker>
<line>There was no thought of pleasing you when she was christen&#8217;d.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JAQ.</speaker>
<line>What stature is she of?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ORL.</speaker>
<line>Just as high as my heart.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JAQ.</speaker>
<line>You are full of pretty answers; have you not been acquainted with goldsmiths&#8217; wives, and conn&#8217;d them out of rings?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ORL.</speaker>
<line>Not so; but I answer you right painted cloth, from whence you have studied your questions.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JAQ.</speaker>
<line>You have a nimble wit; I think &#8217;twas made of Atalanta&#8217;s heels. Will you sit down with me? And we two will rail against our mistress the world, and all our misery.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ORL.</speaker>
<line>I will chide no breather in the world but myself, against whom I know most faults.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JAQ.</speaker>
<line>The worst fault you have is to be in love.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ORL.</speaker>
<line>&#8217;Tis a fault I will not change for your best virtue. I am weary of you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JAQ.</speaker>
<line>By my troth, I was seeking for a fool when I found you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ORL.</speaker>
<line>He is drown&#8217;d in the brook; look but in, and you shall see him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JAQ.</speaker>
<line>There I shall see mine own figure.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ORL.</speaker>
<line>Which I take to be either a fool or a cipher.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>JAQ.</speaker>
<line>I&#8217;ll tarry no longer with you. Farewell, good Signior Love.</line>

<line>I am glad of your departure. <french xml:lang="fr">Adieu</french>, good Monsieur Melancholy.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<stagedir>Aside to Celia.</stagedir>
<line>I will speak to him like a saucy lackey, and under that habit play the knave with him.&#8212;Do you hear, forester?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ORL.</speaker>
<line>Very well. What would you?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>I pray you, what is&#8217;t a&#8217; clock?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ORL.</speaker>
<line>You should ask me what time o&#8217; day; there&#8217;s no clock in the forest.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>Then there is no true lover in the forest, else sighing every minute and groaning every hour would detect the lazy foot of Time as well as a clock.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ORL.</speaker>
<line>And why not the swift foot of Time? Had not that been as proper?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>By no means, sir. Time travels in divers paces with divers persons. I&#8217;ll tell you who Time ambles withal, who Time trots withal, who Time gallops withal, and who he stands still withal.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ORL.</speaker>
<line>I prithee, who doth he trot withal?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>Marry, he trots hard with a young maid between the contract of her marriage and the day it is solemniz&#8217;d. If the interim be but a se&#8217;nnight, Time&#8217;s pace is so hard that it seems the length of seven year.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ORL.</speaker>
<line>Who ambles Time withal?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>With a priest that lacks Latin, and a rich man that hath not the gout; for the one sleeps easily because he cannot study, and the other lives merrily because he feels no pain; the one lacking the burden of lean and wasteful learning, the other knowing no burden of heavy tedious penury. These Time ambles withal.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ORL.</speaker>
<line>Who doth he gallop withal?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>With a thief to the gallows; for though he go as softly as foot can fall, he thinks himself too soon there.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ORL.</speaker>
<line>Who stays it still withal?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>With lawyers in the vacation; for they sleep between term and term, and then they perceive not how Time moves.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ORL.</speaker>
<line>Where dwell you, pretty youth?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>With this shepherdess, my sister; here in the skirts of the forest, like fringe upon a petticoat.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ORL.</speaker>
<line>Are you native of this place?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>As the cony that you see dwell where she is kindled.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ORL.</speaker>
<line>Your accent is something finer than you could purchase in so remov&#8217;d a dwelling.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>I have been told so of many; but indeed an old religious uncle of mine taught me to speak, who was in his youth an inland man, one that knew courtship too well, for there he fell in love. I have heard him read many lectures against it, and I thank God I am not a woman, to be touch&#8217;d with so many giddy offenses as he hath generally tax&#8217;d their whole sex withal.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ORL.</speaker>
<line>Can you remember any of the principal evils that he laid to the charge of women?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>There were none principal, they were all like one another as halfpence are, every one fault seeming monstrous till his fellow-fault came to match it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ORL.</speaker>
<line>I prithee recount some of them.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>No; I will not cast away my physic but on those that are sick. There is a man haunts the forest, that abuses our young plants with carving &#8217;Rosalind&#8217; on their barks; hangs odes upon hawthorns, and elegies on brambles; all, forsooth, deifying the name of Rosalind. If I could meet that fancy-monger, I would give him some good counsel, for he seems to have the quotidian of love upon him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ORL.</speaker>
<line>I am he that is so love-shak&#8217;d, I pray you tell me your remedy.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>There is none of my uncle&#8217;s marks upon you. He taught me how to know a man in love; in which cage of rushes I am sure you are not prisoner.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ORL.</speaker>
<line>What were his marks?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>A lean cheek, which you have not; a blue eye and sunken, which you have not; an unquestionable spirit, which you have not; a beard neglected, which you have not (but I pardon you for that, for simply your having in beard is a younger brother&#8217;s revenue); then your hose should be ungarter&#8217;d, your bonnet unbanded, your sleeve unbutton&#8217;d, your shoe untied, and every thing about you demonstrating a careless desolation. But you are no such man; you are rather point-device in your accoustrements, as loving yourself, than seeming the lover of any other.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ORL.</speaker>
<line>Fair youth, I would I could make thee believe I love.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>Me believe it? You may as soon make her that you love believe it, which I warrant she is apter to do than to confess she does. That is one of the points in the which women still give the lie to their consciences. But in good sooth, are you he that hangs the verses on the trees, wherein Rosalind is so admir&#8217;d?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ORL.</speaker>
<line>I swear to thee, youth, by the white hand of Rosalind, I am that he, that unfortunate he.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ORL.</speaker>
<line>Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>Love is merely a madness, and I tell you, deserves as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do; and the reason why they are not so punish&#8217;d and cur&#8217;d is, that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers are in love too. Yet I profess curing it by counsel.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ORL.</speaker>
<line>Did you ever cure any so?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>Yes, one, and in this manner. He was to imagine me his love, his mistress; and I set him every day to woo me. At which time would I, being but a moonish youth, grieve, be effeminate, changeable, longing and liking, proud, fantastical, apish, shallow, inconstant, full of tears, full of smiles; for every passion something, and for no passion truly any thing, as boys and women are for the most part cattle of this color; would now like him, now loathe him; then entertain him, then forswear him; now weep for him, then spit at him; that I drave my suitor from his mad humor of love to a living humor of madness, which was, to forswear the full stream of the world, and to live in a nook merely monastic. And thus I cur&#8217;d him, and this way will I take upon me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep&#8217;s heart, that there shall not be one spot of love in&#8217;t.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ORL.</speaker>
<line>I would not be cur&#8217;d, youth.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>I would cure you, if you would but call me Rosalind, and come every day to my cote and woo me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ORL.</speaker>
<line>Now, by the faith of my love, I will. Tell me where it is.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>Go with me to it, and I&#8217;ll show it you; and by the way, you shall tell me where in the forest you live. Will you go?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ORL.</speaker>
<line>With all my heart, good youth.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>Nay, you must call me Rosalind. Come, sister, will you go?</line>

<stagedir>Enter Clown (Touchstone), Audrey; and Jaques behind.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>TOUCH.</speaker>
<line>Come apace, good Audrey; I will fetch up your goats, Audrey. And how, Audrey? Am I the man yet? Doth my simple feature content you?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>AUD.</speaker>
<line>Your features, Lord warrant us! What features?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TOUCH.</speaker>
<line>I am here with thee and thy goats as the most capricious poet, honest Ovid, was among the Goths.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JAQ.</speaker>
<stagedir>Aside.</stagedir>
<line>O knowledge ill-inhabited, worse than Jove in a thatch&#8217;d house!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TOUCH.</speaker>
<line>When a man&#8217;s verses cannot be understood, nor a man&#8217;s good wit seconded with the forward child, understanding, it strikes a man more dead than a great reckoning in a little room. Truly, I would the gods had made thee poetical.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>AUD.</speaker>
<line>I do not know what &#8216;poetical&#8217; is. Is it honest in deed and word? Is it a true thing?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TOUCH.</speaker>
<line>No, truly; for the truest poetry is the most feigning, and lovers are given to poetry; and what they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>AUD.</speaker>
<line>Do you wish then that the gods had made me poetical?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TOUCH.</speaker>
<line>I do, truly; for thou swear&#8217;st to me thou art honest. Now if thou wert a poet, I might have some hope thou didst feign.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>AUD.</speaker>
<line>Would you not have me honest?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TOUCH.</speaker>
<line>No, truly, unless thou wert hard-favor&#8217;d; for honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JAQ.</speaker>
<stagedir>Aside.</stagedir>
<line>A material fool!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>AUD.</speaker>
<line>Well, I am not fair, and therefore I pray the gods make me honest.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TOUCH.</speaker>
<line>Truly, and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut were to put good meat into an unclean dish.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>AUD.</speaker>
<line>I am not a slut, though I thank the gods I am foul.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TOUCH.</speaker>
<line>Well, prais&#8217;d be the gods for thy foulness! Sluttishness may come hereafter. But be it as it may be, I will marry thee; and to that end I have been with Sir Oliver Martext, the vicar of the next village, who hath promis&#8217;d to meet me in this place of the forest and to couple us.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JAQ.</speaker><stagedir>Aside.</stagedir>
<line>I would fain see this meeting.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>AUD.</speaker>
<line>Well, the gods give us joy!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TOUCH.</speaker>
<line>Amen. A man may, if he were of a fearful heart, stagger in this attempt; for here we have no temple but the wood, no assembly but horn-beasts. But what though? Courage! As horns are odious, they are necessary. It is said, &#8220;Many a man knows no end of his goods.&#8221; Right! Many a man has good horns, and knows no end of them. Well, that is the dowry of his wife, &#8217;tis none of his own getting. Horns? Even so. Poor men alone? No, no, the noblest deer hath them as huge as the rascal. Is the single man therefore bless&#8217;d? No, as a wall&#8217;d town is more worthier than a village, so is the forehead of a married man more honorable than the bare brow of a bachelor; and by how much defense is better than no skill, by so much is a horn more precious than to want.</line>

<stagedir>Enter Sir Oliver Martext.</stagedir>
<line>Here comes Sir Oliver. Sir Oliver Martext, you are well met. Will you dispatch us here under this tree, or shall we go with you to your chapel?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR OLI.</speaker>
<line>Is there none here to give the woman?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TOUCH.</speaker>
<line>I will not take her on gift of any man.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIR OLI.</speaker>
<line>Truly, she must be given, or the marriage is not lawful.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JAQ.</speaker>
<stagedir>Discovering himself.</stagedir>

<line>Proceed, proceed. I&#8217;ll give her.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TOUCH.</speaker>
<line>Good even, good Master What-ye-call&#8217;t; how do you, sir? You are very well met. God &#8217;ild you for your last company. I am very glad to see you. Even a toy in hand here, sir. Nay, pray be cover&#8217;d.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JAQ.</speaker>
<line>Will you be married, motley?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TOUCH.</speaker>
<line>As the ox hath his bow, sir, the horse his curb, and the falcon her bells, so man hath his desires; and as pigeons bill, so wedlock would be nibbling.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JAQ.</speaker>
<line>And will you (being a man of your breeding) be married under a bush like a beggar? Get you to church, and have a good priest that can tell you what marriage is. This fellow will but join you together as they join wainscot; then one of you will prove a shrunk panel, and like green timber warp, warp.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TOUCH.</speaker>
<stagedir>Aside.</stagedir> 
<line>I am not in the mind but I were better to be married of him than of another, for he is not like to marry me well; and not being well married, it will be a good excuse for me hereafter to leave my wife.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JAQ.</speaker>
<line>Go thou with me, and let me counsel thee.</line>
</speech>

<speech>

<line>Come, sweet Audrey,</line>
<line>We must be married, or we must live in bawdry.</line>

<line>Never talk to me, I will weep.</line>

<speaker>CEL.</speaker>
<line>Do, I prithee, but yet have the grace to consider that tears do not become a man.</line>

<speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CEL.</speaker>
<line>As good cause as one would desire, therefore weep.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>His very hair is of the dissembling color.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CEL.</speaker>
<line>Something browner than Judas&#8217;s. Marry, his kisses are Judas&#8217;s own children.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>I&#8217; faith, his hair is of a good color.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CEL.</speaker>
<line>An excellent color. Your chestnut was ever the only color.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>And his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch of holy bread.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CEL.</speaker>
<line>He hath bought a pair of cast lips of Diana. A nun of winter&#8217;s sisterhood kisses not more religiously, the very ice of chastity is in them.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>But why did he swear he would come this morning, and comes not?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CEL.</speaker>
<line>Nay certainly there is no truth in him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>Do you think so?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CEL.</speaker>
<line>Yes, I think he is not a pick-purse nor a horse-stealer, but for his verity in love, I do think him as concave as a cover&#8217;d goblet or a worm-eaten nut.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>Not true in love?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CEL.</speaker>
<line>Yes, when he is in&#8212;but I think he is not in.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>You have heard him swear downright he was.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CEL.</speaker>
<line>&#8220;Was&#8221; is not &#8220;is.&#8221; Besides, the oath of a lover is no stronger than the word of a tapster; they are both the confirmer of false reckonings. He attends here in the forest on the Duke your father.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>I met the Duke yesterday, and had much question with him. He ask&#8217;d me of what parentage I was. I told him of as good as he, so he laugh&#8217;d and let me go. But what talk we of fathers, when there is such a man as Orlando?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CEL.</speaker>
<line>O, that&#8217;s a brave man! He writes brave verses, speaks brave words, swears brave oaths, and breaks them bravely, quite traverse, athwart the heart of his lover, as a puisne tilter, that spurs his horse but on one side, breaks his staff like a noble goose. But all&#8217;s brave that youth mounts and folly guides. Who comes here?</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Corin.</stagedir>

<line>Mistress and master, you have oft inquired</line>

<line>If you will see a pageant truly play&#8217;d</line>

<speaker>PHE.</speaker>
<line>I would not be thy executioner;</line>
<line>I fly thee for I would not injure thee.</line>
<line>Thou tell&#8217;st me there is murder in mine eye:</line>
<line>&#8217;Tis pretty, sure, and very probable,</line>
<line>That eyes, that are the frail&#8217;st and softest things,</line>
<line>Who shut their coward gates on atomies,</line>
<line>Should be called tyrants, butchers, murderers!</line>
<line>Now I do frown on thee with all my heart,</line>
<line>And if mine eyes can wound, now let them kill thee.</line>
<line>Now counterfeit to swound; why, now fall down,</line>
<line>Or if thou canst not, O, for shame, for shame,</line>
<line>Lie not, to say mine eyes are murderers!</line>
<line>Now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee;</line>
<line>Scratch thee but with a pin, and there remains</line>
<line>Some scar of it; lean upon a rush,</line>
<line>The cicatrice and capable impressure</line>
<line>Thy palm some moment keeps; but now mine eyes,</line>
<line>Which I have darted at thee, hurt thee not,</line>
<line>Nor I am sure there is no force in eyes</line>
<line>That can do hurt.</line>

<line offset="4">O dear Phebe,</line>
<line>If ever (as that ever may be near)</line>
<line>You meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy,</line>
<line>Then shall you know the wounds invisible</line>
<line>That love&#8217;s keen arrows make.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PHE.</speaker>
<line offset="6">But till that time</line>
<line>Come not thou near me; and when that time comes,</line>

<line>And why, I pray you? Who might be your mother,</line>
<line>That you insult, exult, and all at once,</line>
<line>Over the wretched? What though you have no beauty&#8212;</line>
<line>As, by my faith, I see no more in you</line>
<line>Than without candle may go dark to bed&#8212;</line>
<line>Must you be therefore proud and pitiless?</line>
<line>Why, what means this? Why do you look on me?</line>
<line>I see no more in you than in the ordinary</line>
<line>Of nature&#8217;s sale-work. &#8217;Od&#8217;s my little life,</line>
<line>I think she means to tangle my eyes too!</line>
<line>No, faith, proud mistress, hope not after it.</line>
<line>&#8217;Tis not your inky brows, your black silk hair,</line>
<line>Your bugle eyeballs, nor your cheek of cream</line>
<line>That can entame my spirits to your worship.</line>
<line>You foolish shepherd, wherefore do you follow her,</line>
<line>Like foggy south, puffing with wind and rain?</line>
<line>You are a thousand times a properer man</line>
<line>Than she a woman. &#8217;Tis such fools as you</line>
<line>That makes the world full of ill-favor&#8217;d children.</line>
<line>&#8217;Tis not her glass, but you that flatters her,</line>
<line>And out of you she sees herself more proper</line>
<line>Than any of her lineaments can show her.</line>
<line>But, mistress, know yourself, down on your knees,</line>
<line>And thank heaven, fasting, for a good man&#8217;s love;</line>
<line>For I must tell you friendly in your ear,</line>
<line>Sell when you can, you are not for all markets.</line>
<line>Cry the man mercy, love him, take his offer;</line>
<line>Foul is most foul, being foul to be a scoffer.</line>
<line>So take her to thee, shepherd. Fare you well.</line>

<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>He&#8217;s fall&#8217;n in love with your foulness&#8212; and she&#8217;ll fall in love with my anger. If it be so, as fast as she answers thee with frowning looks, I&#8217;ll sauce her with bitter words.&#8212;Why look you so upon me?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PHE.</speaker>
<line>For no ill will I bear you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>I pray you do not fall in love with me,</line>

<line>Besides, I like you not. If you will know my house,</line>
<line>&#8217;Tis at the tuft of olives here hard by.</line>
<line>Will you go, sister? Shepherd, ply her hard.</line>
<line>Come, sister. Shepherdess, look on him better,</line>
<line>And be not proud; though all the world could see,</line>
<line>None could be so abus&#8217;d in sight as he.</line>
<line>Come, to our flock.</line>

<line>Why, I am sorry for thee, gentle Silvius.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>SIL.</speaker>
<line>Where ever sorrow is, relief would be.</line>
<line>If you do sorrow at my grief in love,</line>
<line>By giving love, your sorrow and my grief</line>
<line>Were both extermin&#8217;d.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PHE.</speaker>
<line>Thou hast my love; is not that neighborly?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIL.</speaker>
<line>I would have you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PHE.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Why, that were covetousness.</line>
<line>Silvius, the time was that I hated thee;</line>
<line>And yet it is not that I bear thee love,</line>
<line>But since that thou canst talk of love so well,</line>
<line>Thy company, which erst was irksome to me,</line>
<line>I will endure; and I&#8217;ll employ thee too.</line>
<line>But do not look for further recompense</line>
<line>Than thine own gladness that thou art employ&#8217;d.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIL.</speaker>
<line>So holy and so perfect is my love,</line>
<line>And I in such a poverty of grace,</line>
<line>That I shall think it a most plenteous crop</line>
<line>To glean the broken ears after the man</line>
<line>That the main harvest reaps. Loose now and then</line>
<line>A scatt&#8217;red smile, and that I&#8217;ll live upon.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PHE.</speaker>
<line>Know&#8217;st thou the youth that spoke to me yerwhile?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIL.</speaker>
<line>Not very well, but I have met him oft,</line>
<line>And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds</line>
<line>That the old carlot once was master of.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PHE.</speaker>
<line>Think not I love him, though I ask for him;</line>
<line>&#8217;Tis but a peevish boy&#8212;yet he talks well&#8212;</line>
<line>But what care I for words? Yet words do well</line>
<line>When he that speaks them pleases those that hear.</line>
<line>It is a pretty youth&#8212;not very pretty&#8212;</line>
<line>But sure he&#8217;s proud&#8212;and yet his pride becomes him.</line>
<line>He&#8217;ll make a proper man. The best thing in him</line>
<line>Is his complexion; and faster than his tongue</line>
<line>Did make offense, his eye did heal it up.</line>
<line>He is not very tall&#8212;yet for his years he&#8217;s tall;</line>
<line>His leg is but so so&#8212;and yet &#8217;tis well;</line>
<line>There was a pretty redness in his lip,</line>
<line>A little riper and more lusty red</line>
<line>Than that mix&#8217;d in his cheek; &#8217;twas just the difference</line>
<line>Betwixt the constant red and mingled damask.</line>
<line>There be some women, Silvius, had they mark&#8217;d him</line>
<line>In parcels as I did, would have gone near</line>
<line>To fall in love with him; but for my part</line>
<line>I love him not, nor hate him not; and yet</line>
<line>Have more cause to hate him than to love him,</line>
<line>For what had he to do to chide at me?</line>
<line>He said mine eyes were black and my hair black,</line>
<line>And, now I am rememb&#8217;red, scorn&#8217;d at me.</line>
<line>I marvel why I answer&#8217;d not again.</line>
<line>But that&#8217;s all one; omittance is no quittance.</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll write to him a very taunting letter,</line>
<line>And thou shalt bear it; wilt thou, Silvius?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIL.</speaker>
<line>Phebe, with all my heart.</line>
</speech>

<speaker>PHE.</speaker>
<line offset="5">I&#8217;ll write it straight;</line>

<speech>
<speaker>JAQ.</speaker>
<line>I prithee, pretty youth, let me be better acquainted with thee.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>They say you are a melancholy fellow.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JAQ.</speaker>
<line>I am so; I do love it better than laughing.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>Those that are in extremity of either are abominable fellows, and betray themselves to every modern censure worse than drunkards.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JAQ.</speaker>
<line>Why, &#8217;tis good to be sad and say nothing.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>Why then &#8217;tis good to be a post.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JAQ.</speaker>
<line>I have neither the scholar&#8217;s melancholy, which is emulation; nor the musician&#8217;s, which is fantastical; nor the courtier&#8217;s, which is proud; nor the soldier&#8217;s, which is ambitious; nor the lawyer&#8217;s, which is politic; nor the lady&#8217;s, which is nice; nor the lover&#8217;s, which is all these: but it is a melancholy of mine own, compounded of many simples, extracted from many objects, and indeed the sundry contemplation of my travels, in which my often rumination wraps me in a most humorous sadness.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>A traveller! By my faith, you have great reason to be sad. I fear you have sold your own lands to see other men&#8217;s; then to have seen much, and to have nothing, is to have rich eyes and poor hands.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JAQ.</speaker>
<line>Yes, I have gain&#8217;d my experience.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Orlando.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>And your experience makes you sad. I had rather have a fool to make me merry than experience to make me sad&#8212;and to travel for it too!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ORL.</speaker>
<line>Good day and happiness, dear Rosalind!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JAQ.</speaker>
<line>Nay then God buy you, and you talk in blank verse.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>Farewell, Monsieur Traveller: look you lisp and wear strange suits; disable all the benefits of your own country; be out of love with your nativity, and almost chide God for making you that countenance you are; or I will scarce think you have swam in a gundello.</line>
<stagedir>Exit Jaques.</stagedir>
<line>Why, how now, Orlando, where have you been all this while? You a lover! And you serve me such another trick, never come in my sight more.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ORL.</speaker>
<line>My fair Rosalind, I come within an hour of my promise.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>Break an hour&#8217;s promise in love! He that will divide a minute into a thousand parts, and break but a part of the thousand part of a minute in the affairs of love, it may be said of him that Cupid hath clapp&#8217;d him o&#8217; th&#8217; shoulder, but I&#8217;ll warrant him heart-whole.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ORL.</speaker>
<line>Pardon me, dear Rosalind.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>Nay, and you be so tardy, come no more in my sight. I had as lief be woo&#8217;d of a snail.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ORL.</speaker>
<line>Of a snail?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>Ay, of a snail; for though he comes slowly, he carries his house on his head; a better jointure I think than you make a woman. Besides, he brings his destiny with him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ORL.</speaker>
<line>What&#8217;s that?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>Why, horns! Which such as you are fain to be beholding to your wives for. But he comes arm&#8217;d in his fortune, and prevents the slander of his wife.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ORL.</speaker>
<line>Virtue is no horn-maker; and my Rosalind is virtuous.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>And I am your Rosalind.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CEL.</speaker>
<line>It pleases him to call you so; but he hath a Rosalind of a better leer than you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>Come, woo me, woo me; for now I am in a holiday humor, and like enough to consent. What would you say to me now, and I were your very very Rosalind?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ORL.</speaker>
<line>I would kiss before I spoke.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>Nay, you were better speak first, and when you were gravell&#8217;d for lack of matter, you might take occasion to kiss. Very good orators when they are out, they will spit, and for lovers lacking (God warn us!) matter, the cleanliest shift is to kiss.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ORL.</speaker>
<line>How if the kiss be denied?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>Then she puts you to entreaty, and there begins new matter.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ORL.</speaker>
<line>Who could be out, being before his belov&#8217;d mistress?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>Marry, that should you if I were your mistress, or I should think my honesty ranker than my wit.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ORL.</speaker>
<line>What, of my suit?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>Not out of your apparel, and yet out of your suit. Am not I your Rosalind?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ORL.</speaker>
<line>I take some joy to say you are, because I would be talking of her.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>Well, in her person, I say I will not have you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ORL.</speaker>
<line>Then in mine own person, I die.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>No, faith, die by attorney. The poor world is almost six thousand years old, and in all this time there was not any man died in his own person, videlicet, in a love-cause. Troilus had his brains dash&#8217;d out with a Grecian club, yet he did what he could to die before, and he is one of the patterns of love. Leander, he would have liv&#8217;d many a fair year though Hero had turn&#8217;d nun, if it had not been for a hot midsummer night; for, good youth, he went but forth to wash him in the Hellespont, and being taken with the cramp was drown&#8217;d; and the foolish chroniclers of that age found it was&#8212;Hero of Sestos. But these are all lies: men have died from time to time, and worms have eaten them, but not for love.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ORL.</speaker>
<line>I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind, for I protest her frown might kill me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>By this hand, it will not kill a fly. But come, now I will be your Rosalind in a more coming-on disposition; and ask me what you will, I will grant it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ORL.</speaker>
<line>Then love me, Rosalind.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>Yes, faith, will I, Fridays and Saturdays and all.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ORL.</speaker>
<line>And wilt thou have me?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>Ay, and twenty such.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ORL.</speaker>
<line>What sayest thou?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>Are you not good?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ORL.</speaker>
<line>I hope so.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>Why then, can one desire too much of a good thing? Come, sister, you shall be the priest, and marry us. Give me your hand, Orlando. What do you say, sister?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ORL.</speaker>
<line>Pray thee marry us.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CEL.</speaker>
<line>I cannot say the words.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>You must begin, &#8220;Will you, Orlando&#8221;&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CEL.</speaker>
<line>Go to! Will you, Orlando, have to wife this Rosalind?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ORL.</speaker>
<line>I will.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>Ay, but when?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ORL.</speaker>
<line>Why, now, as fast as she can marry us.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>Then you must say, &#8220;I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.&#8221;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ORL.</speaker>
<line>I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>I might ask you for your commission, but I do take thee, Orlando, for my husband. There&#8217;s a girl goes before the priest, and certainly a woman&#8217;s thought runs before her actions.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ORL.</speaker>
<line>So do all thoughts, they are wing&#8217;d.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>Now tell me how long you would have her after you have possess&#8217;d her.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ORL.</speaker>
<line>Forever and a day.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>Say &#8220;a day,&#8221; without the &#8220;ever.&#8221; No, no, Orlando, men are April when they woo, December when they wed; maids are May when they are maids, but the sky changes when they are wives. I will be more jealous of thee than a Barbary cock-pigeon over his hen, more clamorous than a parrot against rain, more new-fangled than an ape, more giddy in my desires than a monkey. I will weep for nothing, like Diana in the fountain, and I will do that when you are dispos&#8217;d to be merry. I will laugh like a hyen, and that when thou art inclin&#8217;d to sleep.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ORL.</speaker>
<line>But will my Rosalind do so?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>By my life, she will do as I do.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ORL.</speaker>
<line>O, but she is wise.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>Or else she could not have the wit to do this; the wiser, the waywarder. Make the doors upon a woman&#8217;s wit, and it will out at the casement; shut that, and &#8217;twill out at the key-hole; stop that, &#8217;twill fly with the smoke out at the chimney.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ORL.</speaker>
<line>A man that had a wife with such a wit, he might say, &#8220;Wit, whither wilt?&#8221;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>Nay, you might keep that check for it, till you met your wive&#8217;s wit going to your neighbor&#8217;s bed.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ORL.</speaker>
<line>And what wit could wit have to excuse that?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>Marry, to say she came to seek you there. You shall never take her without her answer, unless you take her without her tongue. O, that woman that cannot make her fault her husband&#8217;s occasion, let her never nurse her child herself, for she will breed it like a fool!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ORL.</speaker>
<line>For these two hours, Rosalind, I will leave thee.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>Alas, dear love, I cannot lack thee two hours!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ORL.</speaker>
<line>I must attend the Duke at dinner. By two a&#8217; clock I will be with thee again.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>Ay, go your ways, go your ways; I knew what you would prove; my friends told me as much, and I thought no less. That flattering tongue of yours won me. &#8217;Tis but one cast away, and so come death! Two a&#8217; clock is your hour?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ORL.</speaker>
<line>Ay, sweet Rosalind.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>By my troth, and in good earnest, and so God mend me, and by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous, if you break one jot of your promise, or come one minute behind your hour, I will think you the most pathetical break-promise, and the most hollow lover, and the most unworthy of her you call Rosalind, that may be chosen out of the gross band of the unfaithful; therefore beware my censure, and keep your promise.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ORL.</speaker>
<line>With no less religion than if thou wert indeed my Rosalind; so <french xml:lang="fr">adieu</french>.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>Well, Time is the old justice that examines all such offenders, and let Time try. <french xml:lang="fr">Adieu</french>.</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>O coz, coz, coz, my pretty little coz, that thou didst know how many fathom deep I am in love! But it cannot be sounded; my affection hath an unknown bottom, like the bay of Portugal.</line>

<line>No, that same wicked bastard of Venus that was begot of thought, conceiv&#8217;d of spleen, and born of madness, that blind rascally boy that abuses every one&#8217;s eyes because his own are out, let him be judge how deep I am in love. I&#8217;ll tell thee, Aliena, I cannot be out of the sight of Orlando. I&#8217;ll go find a shadow, and sigh till he come.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>SIL.</speaker>
<line>My errand is to you, fair youth,</line>
<line>My gentle Phebe did bid me give you this.</line>

<stagedir>Gives a letter.</stagedir>
<line>I know not the contents, but as I guess</line>
<line>By the stern brow and waspish action</line>
<line>Which she did use as she was writing of it,</line>
<line>It bears an angry tenure. Pardon me,</line>
<line>I am but as a guiltless messenger.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>Patience herself would startle at this letter,</line>

<line>She says I am not fair, that I lack manners;</line>
<line>She calls me proud, and that she could not love me</line>
<line>Were man as rare as phoenix. &#8217;Od&#8217;s my will,</line>
<line>Her love is not the hare that I do hunt;</line>
<line>Why writes she so to me? Well, shepherd, well,</line>
<line>This is a letter of your own device.</line>

<line>He left a promise to return again</line>
<line>Within an hour, and pacing through the forest,</line>
<line>Chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy,</line>
<line>Lo what befell! He threw his eye aside,</line>
<line>And mark what object did present itself</line>
<line>Under an old oak, whose boughs were moss&#8217;d with age</line>
<line>And high top bald with dry antiquity:</line>
<line>A wretched ragged man, o&#8217;ergrown with hair,</line>
<line>Lay sleeping on his back; about his neck</line>
<line>A green and gilded snake had wreath&#8217;d itself,</line>
<line>Who with her head nimble in threats approach&#8217;d</line>
<line>The opening of his mouth; but suddenly</line>
<line>Seeing Orlando, it unlink&#8217;d itself,</line>
<line>And with indented glides did slip away</line>
<line>Into a bush, under which bush&#8217;s shade</line>
<line>A lioness, with udders all drawn dry,</line>
<line>Lay couching, head on ground, with cat-like watch</line>
<line>When that the sleeping man should stir; for &#8217;tis</line>
<line>The royal disposition of that beast</line>
<line>To prey on nothing that doth seem as dead.</line>
<line>This seen, Orlando did approach the man,</line>
<line>And found it was his brother, his elder brother.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CEL.</speaker>
<line>O, I have heard him speak of that same brother,</line>

<speech>
<speaker>OLI.</speaker>
<line>Twice did he turn his back, and purpos&#8217;d so;</line>
<line>But kindness, nobler ever than revenge,</line>
<line>And nature, stronger than his just occasion,</line>
<line>Made him give battle to the lioness,</line>
<line>Who quickly fell before him, in which hurtling</line>

<line>Brief, I recover&#8217;d him, bound up his wound,</line>

<line>He sent me hither, stranger as I am,</line>
<line>To tell this story, that you might excuse</line>
<line>His broken promise, and to give this napkin,</line>
<line>Dy&#8217;d in his blood, unto the shepherd youth</line>

<line>O, I know where you are. Nay, &#8217;tis true. There was never any thing so sudden but the fight of two rams, and Caesar&#8217;s thrasonical brag of &#8220;I came, saw, and overcame.&#8221; For your brother and my sister no sooner met but they look&#8217;d; no sooner look&#8217;d but they lov&#8217;d; no sooner lov&#8217;d but they sigh&#8217;d; no sooner sigh&#8217;d but they ask&#8217;d one another the reason; no sooner knew the reason but they sought the remedy: and in these degrees have they made a pair of stairs to marriage, which they will climb incontinent, or else be incontinent before marriage. They are in the very wrath of love, and they will together. Clubs cannot part them.</line>

<line>I can live no longer by thinking.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROS.</speaker>
<line>I will weary you then no longer with idle talking. Know of me then (for now I speak to some purpose) that I know you are a gentleman of good conceit. I speak not this that you should bear a good opinion of my knowledge, insomuch I say I know you are; neither do I labor for a greater esteem than may in some little measure draw a belief from you, to do yourself good, and not to grace me. Believe then, if you please, that I can do strange things. I have, since I was three year old, convers&#8217;d with a magician, most profound in his art, and yet not damnable. If you do love Rosalind so near the heart as your gesture cries it out, when your brother marries Aliena, shall you marry her. I know into what straits of fortune she is driven, and it is not impossible to me, if it appear not inconvenient to you, to set her before your eyes tomorrow, human as she is, and without any danger.</line>

<line>Patience once more, whiles our compact is urg&#8217;d:</line>

<speech>

<line>My lord, the first time that I ever saw him</line>
<line>Methought he was a brother to your daughter.</line>
<line>But, my good lord, this boy is forest-born,</line>
<line>And hath been tutor&#8217;d in the rudiments</line>
<line>Of many desperate studies by his uncle,</line>
<line>Whom he reports to be a great magician,</line>
<line>Obscured in the circle of this forest.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>JAQ.</speaker>
<line>There is sure another flood toward, and these couples are coming to the ark. Here comes a pair of very strange beasts, which in all tongues are call&#8217;d fools.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>TOUCH.</speaker>
<line>Salutation and greeting to you all!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JAQ.</speaker>
<line>Good my lord, bid him welcome. This is the motley-minded gentleman that I have so often met in the forest. He hath been a courtier, he swears.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TOUCH.</speaker>
<line>If any man doubt that, let him put me to my purgation. I have trod a measure, I have flatt&#8217;red a lady, I have been politic with my friend, smooth with mine enemy, I have undone three tailors, I have had four quarrels, and like to have fought one.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JAQ.</speaker>
<line>And how was that ta&#8217;en up?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TOUCH.</speaker>
<line>Faith, we met, and found the quarrel was upon the seventh cause.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JAQ.</speaker>
<line>How seventh cause? Good my lord, like this fellow.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUKE S.</speaker>
<line>I like him very well.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TOUCH.</speaker>
<line>God &#8217;ild you, sir, I desire you of the like. I press in here, sir, amongst the rest of the country copulatives, to swear and to forswear, according as marriage binds and blood breaks. A poor virgin, sir, an ill-favor&#8217;d thing, sir, but mine own; a poor humor of mine, sir, to take that that no man else will. Rich honesty dwells like a miser, sir, in a poor house, as your pearl in your foul oyster.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUKE S.</speaker>
<line>By my faith, he is very swift and sententious.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TOUCH.</speaker>
<line>According to the fool&#8217;s bolt, sir, and such dulcet diseases.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JAQ.</speaker>
<line>But for the seventh cause&#8212;how did you find the quarrel on the seventh cause?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TOUCH.</speaker>
<line>Upon a lie seven times remov&#8217;d (bear your body more seeming, Audrey), as thus, sir. I did dislike the cut of a certain courtier&#8217;s beard. He sent me word, if I said his beard was not cut well, he was in the mind it was: this is call&#8217;d the Retort Courteous. If I sent him word again, it was not well cut, he would send me word he cut it to please himself: this is call&#8217;d the Quip Modest. If again, it was not well cut, he disabled my judgment: this is call&#8217;d the Reply Churlish. If again, it was not well cut, he would answer I spake not true: this is call&#8217;d the Reproof Valiant. If again, it was not well cut, he would say I lie: this is call&#8217;d the Countercheck Quarrelsome; and so to Lie Circumstantial and the Lie Direct.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JAQ.</speaker>
<line>And how oft did you say his beard was not well cut?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TOUCH.</speaker>
<line>I durst go no further than the Lie Circumstantial, nor he durst not give me the Lie Direct; and so we measur&#8217;d swords and parted.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JAQ.</speaker>
<line>Can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TOUCH.</speaker>
<line>O sir, we quarrel in print, by the book&#8212;as you have books for good manners. I will name you the degrees. The first, the Retort Courteous; the second, the Quip Modest; the third, the Reply Churlish; the fourth, the Reproof Valiant; the fift, the Countercheck Quarrelsome; the sixt, the Lie with Circumstance; the seventh, the Lie Direct. All these you may avoid but the Lie Direct; and you may avoid that too, with an If. I knew when seven justices could not take up a quarrel, but when the parties were met themselves, one of them thought but of an If, as, &#8220;If you said so, then I said so&#8221;; and they shook hands and swore brothers. Your If is the only peacemaker; much virtue in If.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JAQ.</speaker>
<line>Is not this a rare fellow, my lord? He&#8217;s as good at any thing, and yet a fool.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>DUKE S.</speaker>
<line>He uses his folly like a stalking-horse, and under the presentation of that he shoots his wit.</line>

<line>Men of great worth resorted to this forest,</line>
<line>Address&#8217;d a mighty power, which were on foot</line>
<line>In his own conduct, purposely to take</line>
<line>His brother here, and put him to the sword;</line>
<line>And to the skirts of this wild wood he came;</line>
<line>Where, meeting with an old religious man,</line>
<line>After some question with him, was converted</line>
<line>Both from his enterprise and from the world,</line>
<line>His crown bequeathing to his banish&#8217;d brother,</line>
<line>And all their lands restor&#8217;d to them again</line>

<line>Welcome, young man;</line>
<line>Thou offer&#8217;st fairly to thy brothers&#8217; wedding:</line>

<line>A land itself at large, a potent dukedom.</line>
<line>First, in this forest let us do those ends</line>
<line>That here were well begun and well begot;</line>
<line>And after, every of this happy number,</line>
<line>That have endur&#8217;d shrewd days and nights with us,</line>

<line>It is not the fashion to see the lady the epilogue; but it is no more unhandsome than to see the lord the prologue. If it be true that good wine needs no bush, &#8217;tis true that a good play needs no epilogue. Yet to good wine they do use good bushes; and good plays prove the better by the help of good epilogues. What a case am I in then, that am neither a good epilogue, nor cannot insinuate with you in the behalf of a good play! I am not furnish&#8217;d like a beggar, therefore to beg will not become me. My way is to conjure you, and I&#8217;ll begin with the women. I charge you, O women, for the love you bear to men, to like as much of this play as please you; and I charge you, O men, for the love you bear to women (as I perceive by your simp&#8217;ring, none of you hates them), that between you and the women the play may please. If I were a woman I would kiss as many of you as had beards that pleas&#8217;d me, complexions that lik&#8217;d me, and breaths that I defied not; and I am sure, as many as have good beards, or good faces, or sweet breaths, will for my kind offer, when I make curtsy, bid me farewell.</line>
