<sonnets>

<sonnet>
<sonnetnum>1</sonnetnum>
<quatrain>
<line>From fairest creatures we desire increase,</line>
<line>That thereby beauty&#8217;s rose might never die,</line>
<line>But as the riper should by time decease,</line>
<line>His tender heir might bear his memory:</line>
</quatrain>
<quatrain>
<line>But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes,</line>
<line>Feed&#8217;st thy light&#8217;s flame with self-substantial fuel,</line>
<line>Making a famine where abundance lies,</line>
<line>Thyself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel.</line>
</quatrain>
<quatrain>
<line>Thou that art now the world&#8217;s fresh ornament,</line>
<line>And only herald to the gaudy spring,</line>
<line>Within thine own bud buriest thy content,</line>
<line>And, tender chorl, mak&#8217;st waste in niggarding:</line>
</quatrain>
<couplet>
<line>Pity the world, or else this glutton be,</line>
<line>To eat the world&#8217;s due, by the grave and thee.</line>
</couplet>
</sonnet>

<sonnet>
<sonnetnum>2</sonnetnum>
<quatrain>
<line>When forty winters shall besiege thy brow,</line>
<line>And dig deep trenches in thy beauty&#8217;s field,</line>
<line>Thy youth&#8217;s proud livery, so gaz&#8217;d on now,</line>
<line>Will be a totter&#8217;d weed of small worth held:</line>
</quatrain>
<quatrain>
<line>Then being ask&#8217;d, where all thy beauty lies,</line>
<line>Where all the treasure of thy lusty days,</line>
<line>To say within thine own deep-sunken eyes</line>
<line>Were an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise.</line>
</quatrain>
<quatrain>
<line>How much more praise deserv&#8217;d thy beauty&#8217;s use,</line>
<line>If thou couldst answer,  &#8220;This fair child of mine</line>
<line>Shall sum my count, and make my old excuse,&#8221;</line>
<line>Proving his beauty by succession thine.</line>
</quatrain>
<couplet>
<line>This were to be new made when thou art old,</line>
<line>And see thy blood warm when thou feel&#8217;st it cold.</line>
</couplet>
</sonnet>

<sonnet>
<sonnetnum>3</sonnetnum>
<quatrain>
<line>Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest,</line>
<line>Now is the time that face should form another,</line>
<line>Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,</line>
<line>Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.</line>
</quatrain>
<quatrain>
<line>For where is she so fair whose unear&#8217;d womb</line>
<line>Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?</line>
<line>Or who is he so fond will be the tomb,</line>
<line>Of his self-love, to stop posterity?</line>
</quatrain>
<quatrain>
<line>Thou art thy mother&#8217;s glass, and she in thee</line>
<line>Calls back the lovely April of her prime,</line>
<line>So thou through windows of thine age shalt see,</line>
<line>Despite of wrinkles, this thy golden time.</line>
</quatrain>
<couplet>
<line>But if thou live rememb&#8217;red not to be,</line>
<line>Die single, and thine image dies with thee.</line>
</couplet>
</sonnet>

<sonnet>
<sonnetnum>4</sonnetnum>
<quatrain>
<line>Unthrifty loveliness, why dost thou spend</line>
<line>Upon thyself thy beauty&#8217;s legacy?</line>
<line>Nature&#8217;s bequest gives nothing, but doth lend,</line>
<line>And being frank she lends to those are free:</line>
</quatrain>
<quatrain>
<line>Then, beauteous niggard, why dost thou abuse</line>
<line>The bounteous largess given thee to give?</line>
<line>Profitless usurer, why dost thou use</line>
<line>So great a sum of sums, yet canst not live?</line>
</quatrain>
<quatrain>
<line>For having traffic with thyself alone,</line>
<line>Thou of thyself thy sweet self dost deceive,</line>
<line>Then how when Nature calls thee to be gone,</line>
<line>What acceptable audit canst thou leave?</line>
</quatrain>
<couplet>
<line>Thy unus&#8217;d beauty must be tomb&#8217;d with thee,</line>
<line>Which used lives th&#8217; executor to be.</line>
</couplet>
</sonnet>

<sonnet>
<sonnetnum>5</sonnetnum>
<quatrain>
<line>Those hours that with gentle work did frame</line>
<line>The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell</line>
<line>Will play the tyrants to the very same,</line>
<line>And that unfair which fairly doth excel:</line>
</quatrain>
<quatrain>
<line>For never-resting time leads summer on</line>
<line>To hideous winter and confounds him there,</line>
<line>Sap check&#8217;d with frost and lusty leaves quite gone,</line>
<line>Beauty o&#8217;ersnow&#8217;d and bareness every where:</line>
</quatrain>
<quatrain>
<line>Then were not summer&#8217;s distillation left</line>
<line>A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,</line>
<line>Beauty&#8217;s effect with beauty were bereft,</line>
<line>Nor it nor no remembrance what it was.</line>
</quatrain>
<couplet>
<line>But flowers distill&#8217;d, though they with winter meet,</line>
<line>Leese but their show, their substance still lives sweet.</line>
</couplet>
</sonnet>

<sonnet>
<sonnetnum>6</sonnetnum>
<quatrain>
<line>Then let not winter&#8217;s ragged hand deface</line>
<line>In thee thy summer ere thou be distill&#8217;d:</line>
<line>Make sweet some vial; treasure thou some place</line>
<line>With beauty&#8217;s treasure ere it be self-kill&#8217;d.</line>
</quatrain>
<quatrain>
<line>That use is not forbidden usury,</line>
<line>Which happies those that pay the willing loan;</line>
<line>That&#8217;s for thyself to breed another thee,</line>
<line>Or ten times happier be it ten for one;</line>
</quatrain>
<quatrain>
<line>Ten times thyself were happier than thou art,</line>
<line>If ten of thine ten times refigur&#8217;d thee,</line>
<line>Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart,</line>
<line>Leaving thee living in posterity?</line>
</quatrain>
<couplet>
<line>Be not self-will&#8217;d, for thou art much too fair</line>
<line>To be death&#8217;s conquest and make worms thine heir.</line>
</couplet>
</sonnet>

<sonnet>
<sonnetnum>7</sonnetnum>
<quatrain>
<line>Lo in the orient when the gracious light</line>
<line>Lifts up his burning head, each under eye</line>
<line>Doth homage to his new-appearing sight,</line>
<line>Serving with looks his sacred majesty,</line>
</quatrain>
<quatrain>
<line>And having climb&#8217;d the steep-up heavenly hill,</line>
<line>Resembling strong youth in his middle age,</line>
<line>Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still,</line>
<line>Attending on his golden pilgrimage:</line>
</quatrain>
<quatrain>
<line>But when from highmost pitch, with weary car,</line>
<line>Like feeble age he reeleth from the day,</line>
<line>The eyes (&#8217;fore duteous) now converted are</line>
<line>From his low tract and look another way:</line>
</quatrain>
<couplet>
<line>So thou, thyself outgoing in thy noon,</line>
<line>Unlook&#8217;d on diest unless thou get a son.</line>
</couplet>
</sonnet>

<sonnet>
<sonnetnum>8</sonnetnum>
<quatrain>
<line>Music to hear, why hear&#8217;st thou music sadly?</line>
<line>Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy.</line>
<line>Why lov&#8217;st thou that which thou receiv&#8217;st not gladly,</line>
<line>Or else receiv&#8217;st with pleasure thine annoy?</line>
</quatrain>
<quatrain>
<line>If the true concord of well-tuned sounds,</line>
<line>By unions married, do offend thine ear,</line>
<line>They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds</line>
<line>In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear.</line>
</quatrain>
<quatrain>
<line>Mark how one string, sweet husband to another,</line>
<line>Strikes each in each by mutual ordering;</line>
<line>Resembling sire, and child, and happy mother,</line>
<line>Who all in one, one pleasing note do sing:</line>
</quatrain>
<couplet>
<line>Whose speechless song, being many, seeming one,</line>
<line>Sings this to thee,  &#8220;Thou single wilt prove none.&#8221;</line>
</couplet>
</sonnet>

<sonnet>
<sonnetnum>9</sonnetnum>
<quatrain>
<line>Is it for fear to wet a widow&#8217;s eye</line>
<line>That thou consum&#8217;st thyself in single life?</line>
<line>Ah! If thou issueless shalt hap to die,</line>
<line>The world will wail thee like a makeless wife,</line>
</quatrain>
<quatrain>
<line>The world will be thy widow and still weep,</line>
<line>That thou no form of thee hast left behind,</line>
<line>When every private widow well may keep,</line>
<line>By children&#8217;s eyes, her husband&#8217;s shape in mind.</line>
</quatrain>
<quatrain>
<line>Look what an unthrift in the world doth spend</line>
<line>Shifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it,</line>
<line>But beauty&#8217;s waste hath in the world an end,</line>
<line>And kept unus&#8217;d, the user so destroys it:</line>
</quatrain>
<couplet>
<line>No love toward others in that bosom sits</line>
<line>That on himself such murd&#8217;rous shame commits.</line>
</couplet>
</sonnet>

<sonnet>
<sonnetnum>10</sonnetnum>
<quatrain>
<line>For shame deny that thou bear&#8217;st love to any,</line>
<line>Who for thyself art so unprovident.</line>
<line>Grant, if thou wilt, thou art belov&#8217;d of many,</line>
<line>But that thou none lov&#8217;st is most evident;</line>
</quatrain>
<quatrain>
<line>For thou art so possess&#8217;d with murd&#8217;rous hate,</line>
<line>That &#8217;gainst thyself thou stick&#8217;st not to conspire,</line>
<line>Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate</line>
<line>Which to repair should be thy chief desire.</line>
</quatrain>
<quatrain>
<line>O, change thy thought, that I may change my mind!</line>
<line>Shall hate be fairer lodg&#8217;d than gentle love?</line>
<line>Be as thy presence is gracious and kind,</line>
<line>Or to thyself at least kind-hearted prove:</line>
</quatrain>
<couplet>
<line>Make thee another self for love of me,</line>
<line>That beauty still may live in thine or thee.</line>
</couplet>
</sonnet>

<sonnet>
<sonnetnum>11</sonnetnum>
<quatrain>
<line>As fast as thou shalt wane, so fast thou grow&#8217;st,</line>
<line>In one of thine, from that which thou departest,</line>
<line>And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow&#8217;st</line>
<line>Thou mayst call thine, when thou from youth convertest.</line>
</quatrain>
<quatrain>
<line>Herein lives wisdom, beauty, and increase,</line>
<line>Without this, folly, age, and cold decay.</line>
<line>If all were minded so, the times should cease,</line>
<line>And threescore year would make the world away.</line>
</quatrain>
<quatrain>
<line>Let those whom nature hath not made for store,</line>
<line>Harsh, featureless, and rude, barrenly perish:</line>
<line>Look whom she best endow&#8217;d she gave the more;</line>
<line>Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish.</line>
</quatrain>
<couplet>
<line>She carv&#8217;d thee for her seal, and meant thereby,</line>
<line>Thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die.</line>
</couplet>
</sonnet>

<sonnet>
<sonnetnum>12</sonnetnum>
<quatrain>
<line>When I do count the clock that tells the time,</line>
<line>And see the brave day sunk in hideous night;</line>
<line>When I behold the violet past prime,</line>
<line>And sable curls all silver&#8217;d o&#8217;er with white;</line>
</quatrain>
<quatrain>
<line>When lofty trees I see barren of leaves,</line>
<line>Which erst from heat did canopy the herd,</line>
<line>And summer&#8217;s green all girded up in sheaves</line>
<line>Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard:</line>
</quatrain>
<quatrain>
<line>Then of thy beauty do I question make</line>
<line>That thou among the wastes of time must go,</line>
<line>Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake,</line>
<line>And die as fast as they see others grow,</line>
</quatrain>
<couplet>
<line>And nothing &#8217;gainst Time&#8217;s scythe can make defense</line>
<line>Save breed, to brave him when he takes thee hence.</line>
</couplet>
</sonnet>

<sonnet>
<sonnetnum>13</sonnetnum>
<quatrain>
<line>O that you were yourself! But, love, you are</line>
<line>No longer yours than you yourself here live:</line>
<line>Against this coming end you should prepare,</line>
<line>And your sweet semblance to some other give.</line>
</quatrain>
<quatrain>
<line>So should that beauty which you hold in lease</line>
<line>Find no determination; then you were</line>
<line>Yourself again after yourself&#8217;s decease,</line>
<line>When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear.</line>
</quatrain>
<quatrain>
<line>Who lets so fair a house fall to decay,</line>
<line>Which husbandry in honor might uphold</line>
<line>Against the stormy gusts of winter&#8217;s day</line>
<line>And barren rage of death&#8217;s eternal cold?</line>
</quatrain>
<couplet>
<line>O, none but unthrifts: dear my love, you know</line>
<line>You had a father, let your son say so.</line>
</couplet>
</sonnet>

<sonnet>
<sonnetnum>14</sonnetnum>
<quatrain>
<line>Not from the stars do I my judgment pluck,</line>
<line>And yet methinks I have astronomy,</line>
<line>But not to tell of good or evil luck,</line>
<line>Of plagues, of dearths, or seasons&#8217; quality;</line>
</quatrain>
<quatrain>
<line>Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell,</line>
<line>&#8217;Pointing to each his thunder, rain, and wind,</line>
<line>Or say with princes if it shall go well</line>
<line>By oft predict that I in heaven find.</line>
</quatrain>
<quatrain>
<line>But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,</line>
<line>And, constant stars, in them I read such art</line>
<line>As truth and beauty shall together thrive</line>
<line>If from thyself to store thou wouldst convert;</line>
</quatrain>
<couplet>
<line>Or else of thee this I prognosticate,</line>
<line>Thy end is truth&#8217;s and beauty&#8217;s doom and date.</line>
</couplet>
</sonnet>

<sonnet>
<sonnetnum>15</sonnetnum>
<quatrain>
<line>When I consider every thing that grows</line>
<line>Holds in perfection but a little moment;</line>
<line>That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows</line>
<line>Whereon the stars in secret influence comment;</line>
</quatrain>
<quatrain>
<line>When I perceive that men as plants increase,</line>
<line>Cheered and check&#8217;d even by the self-same sky,</line>
<line>Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,</line>
<line>And wear their brave state out of memory:</line>
</quatrain>
<quatrain>
<line>Then the conceit of this inconstant stay</line>
<line>Sets you most rich in youth before my sight,</line>
<line>Where wasteful Time debateth with Decay</line>
<line>To change your day of youth to sullied night,</line>
</quatrain>
<couplet>
<line>And all in war with Time for love of you,</line>
<line>As he takes from you, I ingraft you new.</line>
</couplet>
</sonnet>

<sonnet>
<sonnetnum>16</sonnetnum>
<quatrain>
<line>But wherefore do not you a mightier way</line>
<line>Make war upon this bloody tyrant Time?</line>
<line>And fortify yourself in your decay</line>
<line>With means more blessed than my barren rhyme?</line>
</quatrain>
<quatrain>
<line>Now stand you on the top of happy hours,</line>
<line>And many maiden gardens, yet unset,</line>
<line>With virtuous wish would bear your living flowers,</line>
<line>Much liker than your painted counterfeit:</line>
</quatrain>
<quatrain>
<line>So should the lines of life that life repair</line>
<line>Which this time&#8217;s pencil, or my pupil pen,</line>
<line>Neither in inward worth nor outward fair</line>
<line>Can make you live yourself in eyes of men.</line>
</quatrain>
<couplet>
<line>To give away yourself keeps yourself still,</line>
<line>And you must live drawn by your own sweet skill.</line>
</couplet>
</sonnet>

<sonnet>
<sonnetnum>17</sonnetnum>
<quatrain>
<line>Who will believe my verse in time to come</line>
<line>If it were fill&#8217;d with your most high deserts?</line>
<line>Though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb</line>
<line>Which hides your life, and shows not half your parts.</line>
</quatrain>
<quatrain>
<line>If I could write the beauty of your eyes,</line>
<line>And in fresh numbers number all your graces,</line>
<line>The age to come would say, &#8220;This poet lies,</line>
<line>Such heavenly touches ne&#8217;er touch&#8217;d earthly faces.&#8221;</line>
</quatrain>
<quatrain>
<line>So should my papers (yellowed with their age)</line>
<line>Be scorn&#8217;d, like old men of less truth than tongue,</line>
<line>And your true rights be term&#8217;d a poet&#8217;s rage,</line>
<line>And stretched metre of an antique song:</line>
</quatrain>
<couplet>
<line>But were some child of yours alive that time,</line>
<line>You should live twice, in it and in my rhyme.</line>
</couplet>
</sonnet>

<sonnet>
<sonnetnum>18</sonnetnum>
<quatrain>
<line>Shall I compare thee to a summer&#8217;s day?</line>
<line>Thou art more lovely and more temperate:</line>
<line>Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,</line>
<line>And summer&#8217;s lease hath all too short a date;</line>
</quatrain>
<quatrain>
<line>Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,</line>
<line>And often is his gold complexion dimm&#8217;d,</line>
<line>And every fair from fair sometime declines,</line>
<line>By chance or nature&#8217;s changing course untrimm&#8217;d:</line>
</quatrain>
<quatrain>
<line>But thy eternal summer shall not fade,</line>
<line>Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow&#8217;st,</line>
<line>Nor shall Death brag thou wand&#8217;rest in his shade,</line>
<line>When in eternal lines to time thou grow&#8217;st.</line>
</quatrain>
<couplet>
<line>So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,</line>
<line>So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.</line>
</couplet>
</sonnet>

<sonnet>
<sonnetnum>19</sonnetnum>
<quatrain>
<line>Devouring Time, blunt thou the lion&#8217;s paws,</line>
<line>And make the earth devour her own sweet brood;</line>
<line>Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger&#8217;s jaws,</line>
<line>And burn the long-liv&#8217;d phoenix in her blood;</line>
</quatrain>
<quatrain>
<line>Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleet&#8217;st,</line>
<line>And do what e&#8217;er thou wilt, swift-footed Time,</line>
<line>To the wide world and all her fading sweets:</line>
<line>But I forbid thee one most heinous crime,</line>
</quatrain>
<quatrain>
<line>O, carve not with thy hours my love&#8217;s fair brow,</line>
<line>Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen;</line>
<line>Him in thy course untainted do allow,</line>
<line>For beauty&#8217;s pattern to succeeding men.</line>
</quatrain>
<couplet>
<line>Yet do thy worst, old Time: despite thy wrong,</line>
<line>My love shall in my verse ever live young.</line>
</couplet>
</sonnet>

<sonnet>
<sonnetnum>20</sonnetnum>
<quatrain>
<line>A woman&#8217;s face with Nature&#8217;s own hand painted</line>
<line>Hast thou, the master mistress of my passion;</line>
<line>A woman&#8217;s gentle heart but not acquainted</line>
<line>With shifting change as is false women&#8217;s fashion;</line>
</quatrain>
<quatrain>
<line>An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling,</line>
<line>Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth;</line>
<line>A man in hue all hues in his controlling,</line>
<line>Which steals men&#8217;s eyes and women&#8217;s souls amazeth.</line>
</quatrain>
<quatrain>
<line>And for a woman wert thou first created,</line>
<line>Till Nature as she wrought thee fell a-doting,</line>
<line>And by addition me of thee defeated,</line>
<line>By adding one thing to my purpose nothing.</line>
</quatrain>
<couplet>
<line>But since she prick&#8217;d thee out for women&#8217;s pleasure,</line>
<line>Mine be thy love, and thy love&#8217;s use their treasure.</line>
</couplet>
</sonnet>



<sonnet>
<sonnetnum>21</sonnetnum>
<quatrain>
<line>So is it not with me as with that Muse</line>
<line>Stirr&#8217;d by a painted beauty to his verse,</line>
<line>Who heaven itself for ornament doth use,</line>
<line>And every fair with his fair doth rehearse,</line>
</quatrain>
<quatrain>
<line>Making a couplement of proud compare</line>
<line>With sun and moon, with earth and sea&#8217;s rich gems,</line>
<line>With April&#8217;s first-born flowers, and all things rare</line>
<line>That heaven&#8217;s air in this huge rondure hems.</line>
</quatrain>
<quatrain>
<line>O, let me, true in love, but truly write,</line>
<line>And then believe me, my love is as fair</line>
<line>As any mother&#8217;s child, though not so bright</line>
<line>As those gold candles fix&#8217;d in heaven&#8217;s air:</line>
</quatrain>
<couplet>
<line>Let them say more that like of hearsay well,</line>
<line>I will not praise that purpose not to sell.</line>
</couplet>
</sonnet>

<sonnet>
<sonnetnum>22</sonnetnum>
<quatrain>
<line>My glass shall not persuade me I am old,</line>
<line>So long as youth and thou are of one date,</line>
<line>But when in thee time&#8217;s furrows I behold,</line>
<line>Then look I death my days should expiate.</line>
</quatrain>
<quatrain>
<line>For all that beauty that doth cover thee</line>
<line>Is but the seemly raiment of my heart,</line>
<line>Which in thy breast doth live, as thine in me:</line>
<line>How can I then be elder than thou art?</line>
</quatrain>
<quatrain>
<line>O, therefore, love, be of thyself so wary</line>
<line>As I, not for myself, but for thee will,</line>
<line>Bearing thy heart, which I will keep so chary</line>
<line>As tender nurse her babe from faring ill.</line>
</quatrain>
<couplet>
<line>Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain,</line>
<line>Thou gav&#8217;st me thine not to give back again.</line>
</couplet>
</sonnet>

<sonnet>
<sonnetnum>23</sonnetnum>
<quatrain>
<line>As an unperfect actor on the stage,</line>
<line>Who with his fear is put besides his part,</line>
<line>Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,</line>
<line>Whose strength&#8217;s abundance weakens his own heart,</line>
</quatrain>
<quatrain>
<line>So I, for fear of trust, forget to say</line>
<line>The perfect ceremony of love&#8217;s rite,</line>
<line>And in mine own love&#8217;s strength seem to decay,</line>
<line>O&#8217;ercharg&#8217;d with burden of mine own love&#8217;s might.</line>
</quatrain>
<quatrain>
<line>O, let my books be then the eloquence</line>
<line>And dumb presagers of my speaking breast,</line>
<line>Who plead for love, and look for recompense,</line>
<line>More than that tongue that more hath more express&#8217;d.</line>
</quatrain>
<couplet>
<line>O, learn to read what silent love hath writ:</line>
<line>To hear with eyes belongs to love&#8217;s fine wit.</line>
</couplet>
</sonnet>

<sonnet>
<sonnetnum>24</sonnetnum>
<quatrain>

</quatrain>
<quatrain>
<line>To win me soon to hell, my female evil</line>
<line>Tempteth my better angel from my side,</line>
<line>And would corrupt my saint to be a devil,</line>
<line>Wooing his purity with her foul pride.</line>
</quatrain>
<quatrain>
<line>And whether that my angel be turn&#8217;d fiend</line>
<line>Suspect I may, yet not directly tell,</line>
<line>But being both from me, both to each friend,</line>
<line>I guess one angel in another&#8217;s hell.</line>
</quatrain>
<couplet>
<line>Yet this shall I ne&#8217;er know, but live in doubt,</line>
<line>Till my bad angel fire my good one out.</line>

<line>Those lips that Love&#8217;s own hand did make</line>
<line>Breath&#8217;d forth the sound that said  &#8220;I hate&#8221;</line>
<line>To me that languish&#8217;d for her sake;</line>
<line>But when she saw my woeful state,</line>
</quatrain>
<quatrain>
<line>Straight in her heart did mercy come,</line>
<line>Chiding that tongue that, ever sweet,</line>
<line>Was us&#8217;d in giving gentle doom,</line>
<line>And taught it thus anew to greet:</line>
</quatrain>
<quatrain>
<line>&#8220;I hate&#8221; she alter&#8217;d with an end</line>
<line>That follow&#8217;d it as gentle day</line>
<line>Doth follow night, who like a fiend</line>
<line>From heaven to hell is flown away:</line>
</quatrain>
<couplet>
<line>&#8217;I hate&#8217; from hate away she threw,</line>
<line>And sav&#8217;d my life, saying &#8220;not you.&#8221;</line>

<line>Poor soul, the centre of my sinful earth,</line>
<line>Feeding these rebel pow&#8217;rs that thee array,</line>
<line>Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth,</line>
<line>Painting thy outward walls so costly gay?</line>
</quatrain>
<quatrain>
<line>Why so large cost, having so short a lease,</line>
<line>Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend?</line>
<line>Shall worms, inheritors of this excess,</line>
<line>Eat up thy charge? Is this thy body&#8217;s end?</line>
</quatrain>
<quatrain>
<line>Then, soul, live thou upon thy servant&#8217;s loss,</line>
<line>And let that pine to aggravate thy store;</line>
<line>Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross;</line>
<line>Within be fed, without be rich no more:</line>
</quatrain>
<couplet>
<line>So shalt thou feed on Death, that feeds on men,</line>
<line>And Death once dead, there&#8217;s no more dying then.</line>
</couplet>

<sonnet>
<sonnetnum>147</sonnetnum>
<quatrain>
<line>My love is as a fever, longing still</line>
<line>For that which longer nurseth the disease,</line>
<line>Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill,</line>
<line>Th&#8217; uncertain sickly appetite to please.</line>
</quatrain>
<quatrain>
<line>My reason, the physician to my love,</line>
<line>Angry that his prescriptions are not kept,</line>
<line>Hath left me, and I desperate now approve</line>
<line>Desire is death, which physic did except.</line>
</quatrain>
<quatrain>
<line>Past cure I am, now reason is past care,</line>
<line>And frantic mad with evermore unrest;</line>
<line>My thoughts and my discourse as madmen&#8217;s are,</line>
<line>At randon from the truth vainly express&#8217;d;</line>
</quatrain>
<couplet>
<line>For I have sworn thee fair, and thought thee bright,</line>
<line>Who art as black as hell, as dark as night.</line>

<sonnetnum>148</sonnetnum>
<quatrain>
<line>O me! What eyes hath Love put in my head,</line>
<line>Which have no correspondence with true sight,</line>
<line>Or if they have, where is my judgment fled,</line>
<line>That censures falsely what they see aright?</line>
</quatrain>
<quatrain>
<line>If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote,</line>
<line>What means the world to say it is not so?</line>
<line>If it be not, then love doth well denote</line>
<line>Love&#8217;s eye is not so true as all men&#8217;s: no,</line>
</quatrain>
<quatrain>
<line>How can it? O, how can Love&#8217;s eye be true,</line>
<line>That is so vex&#8217;d with watching and with tears?</line>
<line>No marvel then though I mistake my view,</line>
<line>The sun itself sees not till heaven clears.</line>
</quatrain>
<couplet>
<line>O cunning Love, with tears thou keep&#8217;st me blind,</line>
<line>Lest eyes well seeing thy foul faults should find.</line>
</couplet>
</sonnet>

<sonnet>
<sonnetnum>149</sonnetnum>
<quatrain>
<line>Canst thou, O cruel, say I love thee not,</line>
<line>When I against myself with thee partake?</line>
<line>Do I not think on thee when I forgot</line>
<line>Am of myself, all tyrant for thy sake?</line>
</quatrain>
<quatrain>
<line>Who hateth thee that I do call my friend?</line>
<line>On whom frown&#8217;st thou that I do fawn upon?</line>
<line>Nay, if thou low&#8217;r&#8217;st on me, do I not spend</line>
<line>Revenge upon myself with present moan?</line>
</quatrain>
<quatrain>
<line>What merit do I in myself respect,</line>
<line>That is so proud thy service to despise,</line>
<line>When all my best doth worship thy defect,</line>
<line>Commanded by the motion of thine eyes?</line>
</quatrain>
<couplet>
<line>But, love, hate on, for now I know thy mind:</line>
<line>Those that can see thou lov&#8217;st, and I am blind.</line>
</couplet>
</sonnet>

<sonnet>
<sonnetnum>150</sonnetnum>
<quatrain>
<line>O, from what pow&#8217;r hast thou this pow&#8217;rful might</line>
<line>With insufficiency my heart to sway,</line>
<line>To make me give the lie to my true sight,</line>
<line>And swear that brightness doth not grace the day?</line>
</quatrain>
<quatrain>
<line>Whence hast thou this becoming of things ill,</line>
<line>That in the very refuse of thy deeds</line>
<line>There is such strength and warrantise of skill</line>
<line>That in my mind thy worst all best exceeds?</line>
</quatrain>
<quatrain>
<line>Who taught thee how to make me love thee more,</line>
<line>The more I hear and see just cause of hate?</line>
<line>O, though I love what others do abhor,</line>
<line>With others thou shouldst not abhor my state.</line>
</quatrain>
<couplet>
<line>If thy unworthiness rais&#8217;d love in me,</line>
<line>More worthy I to be belov&#8217;d of thee.</line>

<sonnet>
<sonnetnum>151</sonnetnum>
<quatrain>
<line>Love is too young to know what conscience is,</line>
<line>Yet who knows not conscience is born of love?</line>
<line>Then, gentle cheater, urge not my amiss,</line>
<line>Lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove:</line>
</quatrain>
<quatrain>
<line>For thou betraying me, I do betray</line>
<line>My nobler part to my gross body&#8217;s treason;</line>
<line>My soul doth tell my body that he may</line>
<line>Triumph in love; flesh stays no farther reason,</line>
</quatrain>
<quatrain>
<line>But rising at thy name doth point out thee</line>
<line>As his triumphant prize. Proud of this pride,</line>
<line>He is contented thy poor drudge to be,</line>
<line>To stand in thy affairs, fall by thy side.</line>
</quatrain>
<couplet>
<line>No want of conscience hold it that I call</line>
<line>Her &#8220;love&#8221; for whose dear love I rise and fall.</line>
</couplet>
</sonnet>

<sonnet>
<sonnetnum>152</sonnetnum>
<quatrain>
<line>In loving thee thou know&#8217;st I am forsworn,</line>
<line>But thou art twice forsworn, to me love swearing;</line>
<line>In act thy bed-vow broke, and new faith torn</line>
<line>In vowing new hate after new love bearing.</line>
</quatrain>
<quatrain>
<line>But why of two oaths&#8217; breach do I accuse thee,</line>
<line>When I break twenty? I am perjur&#8217;d most,</line>
<line>For all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee,</line>
<line>And all my honest faith in thee is lost;</line>
</quatrain>
<quatrain>
<line>For I have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness,</line>
<line>Oaths of thy love, thy truth, thy constancy,</line>
<line>And to enlighten thee gave eyes to blindness,</line>
<line>Or made them swear against the thing they see;</line>
</quatrain>
<couplet>
<line>For I have sworn thee fair: more perjur&#8217;d eye,</line>
<line>To swear against the truth so foul a lie!</line>

<sonnetnum>153</sonnetnum>
<quatrain>
<line>Cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep;</line>
<line>A maid of Dian&#8217;s this advantage found,</line>
<line>And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep</line>
<line>In a cold valley-fountain of that ground;</line>
</quatrain>
<quatrain>
<line>Which borrow&#8217;d from this holy fire of Love</line>
<line>A dateless lively heat, still to endure,</line>
<line>And grew a seething bath, which yet men prove</line>
<line>Against strange maladies a sovereign cure.</line>
</quatrain>
<quatrain>
<line>But at my mistress&#8217; eye Love&#8217;s brand new fired,</line>
<line>The boy for trial needs would touch my breast;</line>
<line>I sick withal the help of bath desired,</line>
<line>And thither hied, a sad distemper&#8217;d guest;</line>
</quatrain>
<couplet>
<line>But found no cure: the bath for my help lies</line>
<line>Where Cupid got new fire&#8212;my mistress&#8217; eyes.</line>
</couplet>
</sonnet>

<sonnet>
<sonnetnum>154</sonnetnum>
<quatrain>
<line>The little Love-god, lying once asleep,</line>
<line>Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,</line>
<line>Whilst many nymphs that vow&#8217;d chaste life to keep</line>
<line>Came tripping by, but in her maiden hand</line>
</quatrain>
<quatrain>
<line>The fairest votary took up that fire,</line>
<line>Which many legions of true hearts had warm&#8217;d,</line>
<line>And so the general of hot desire</line>
<line>Was sleeping by a virgin hand disarm&#8217;d.</line>
</quatrain>
<quatrain>
<line>This brand she quenched in a cool well by,</line>
<line>Which from Love&#8217;s fire took heat perpetual,</line>
<line>Growing a bath and healthful remedy</line>
<line>For men diseas&#8217;d, but I, my mistress&#8217; thrall,</line>
</quatrain>
<couplet>
<line>Came there for cure, and this by that I prove:</line>
<line>Love&#8217;s fire heats water, water cools not love.</line>
</couplet>
