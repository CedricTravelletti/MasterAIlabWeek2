<sonnets>

<sonnet>
<sonnetnum>1</sonnetnum>
<line>From fairest creatures we desire increase,</line>
<line>That thereby beauty&#8217;s rose might never die,</line>
<line>But as the riper should by time decease,</line>
<line>His tender heir might bear his memory:</line>
<line>But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes,</line>
<line>Feed&#8217;st thy light&#8217;s flame with self-substantial fuel,</line>
<line>Making a famine where abundance lies,</line>
<line>Thyself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel.</line>
<line>Thou that art now the world&#8217;s fresh ornament,</line>
<line>And only herald to the gaudy spring,</line>
<line>Within thine own bud buriest thy content,</line>
<line>And, tender chorl, mak&#8217;st waste in niggarding:</line>
<couplet>Pity the world, or else this glutton be,</couplet>
<couplet>To eat the world&#8217;s due, by the grave and thee.</couplet>
</sonnet>

<sonnet>
<sonnetnum>2</sonnetnum>
<line>When forty winters shall besiege thy brow,</line>
<line>And dig deep trenches in thy beauty&#8217;s field,</line>
<line>Thy youth&#8217;s proud livery, so gaz&#8217;d on now,</line>
<line>Will be a totter&#8217;d weed of small worth held:</line>
<line>Then being ask&#8217;d, where all thy beauty lies,</line>
<line>Where all the treasure of thy lusty days,</line>
<line>To say within thine own deep-sunken eyes</line>
<line>Were an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise.</line>
<line>How much more praise deserv&#8217;d thy beauty&#8217;s use,</line>
<line>If thou couldst answer,  &#8220;This fair child of mine</line>
<line>Shall sum my count, and make my old excuse,&#8221;</line>
<line>Proving his beauty by succession thine.</line>
<couplet>This were to be new made when thou art old,</couplet>
<couplet>And see thy blood warm when thou feel&#8217;st it cold.</couplet>
</sonnet>

<sonnet>
<sonnetnum>3</sonnetnum>
<line>Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest,</line>
<line>Now is the time that face should form another,</line>
<line>Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,</line>
<line>Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.</line>
<line>For where is she so fair whose unear&#8217;d womb</line>
<line>Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?</line>
<line>Or who is he so fond will be the tomb,</line>
<line>Of his self-love, to stop posterity?</line>
<line>Thou art thy mother&#8217;s glass, and she in thee</line>
<line>Calls back the lovely April of her prime,</line>
<line>So thou through windows of thine age shalt see,</line>
<line>Despite of wrinkles, this thy golden time.</line>
<couplet>But if thou live rememb&#8217;red not to be,</couplet>
<couplet>Die single, and thine image dies with thee.</couplet>
</sonnet>

<sonnet>
<sonnetnum>4</sonnetnum>
<line>Unthrifty loveliness, why dost thou spend</line>
<line>Upon thyself thy beauty&#8217;s legacy?</line>
<line>Nature&#8217;s bequest gives nothing, but doth lend,</line>
<line>And being frank she lends to those are free:</line>
<line>Then, beauteous niggard, why dost thou abuse</line>
<line>The bounteous largess given thee to give?</line>
<line>Profitless usurer, why dost thou use</line>
<line>So great a sum of sums, yet canst not live?</line>
<line>For having traffic with thyself alone,</line>
<line>Thou of thyself thy sweet self dost deceive,</line>
<line>Then how when Nature calls thee to be gone,</line>
<line>What acceptable audit canst thou leave?</line>
<couplet>Thy unus&#8217;d beauty must be tomb&#8217;d with thee,</couplet>
<couplet>Which used lives th&#8217; executor to be.</couplet>
</sonnet>

<sonnet>
<sonnetnum>5</sonnetnum>
<line>Those hours that with gentle work did frame</line>
<line>The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell</line>
<line>Will play the tyrants to the very same,</line>
<line>And that unfair which fairly doth excel:</line>
<line>For never-resting time leads summer on</line>
<line>To hideous winter and confounds him there,</line>
<line>Sap check&#8217;d with frost and lusty leaves quite gone,</line>
<line>Beauty o&#8217;ersnow&#8217;d and bareness every where:</line>
<line>Then were not summer&#8217;s distillation left</line>
<line>A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,</line>
<line>Beauty&#8217;s effect with beauty were bereft,</line>
<line>Nor it nor no remembrance what it was.</line>
<couplet>But flowers distill&#8217;d, though they with winter meet,</couplet>
<couplet>Leese but their show, their substance still lives sweet.</couplet>
</sonnet>

<sonnet>
<sonnetnum>6</sonnetnum>
<line>Then let not winter&#8217;s ragged hand deface</line>
<line>In thee thy summer ere thou be distill&#8217;d:</line>
<line>Make sweet some vial; treasure thou some place</line>
<line>With beauty&#8217;s treasure ere it be self-kill&#8217;d.</line>
<line>That use is not forbidden usury,</line>
<line>Which happies those that pay the willing loan;</line>
<line>That&#8217;s for thyself to breed another thee,</line>
<line>Or ten times happier be it ten for one;</line>
<line>Ten times thyself were happier than thou art,</line>
<line>If ten of thine ten times refigur&#8217;d thee,</line>
<line>Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart,</line>
<line>Leaving thee living in posterity?</line>
<couplet>Be not self-will&#8217;d, for thou art much too fair</couplet>
<couplet>To be death&#8217;s conquest and make worms thine heir.</couplet>
</sonnet>

<sonnet>
<sonnetnum>7</sonnetnum>
<line>Lo in the orient when the gracious light</line>
<line>Lifts up his burning head, each under eye</line>
<line>Doth homage to his new-appearing sight,</line>
<line>Serving with looks his sacred majesty,</line>
<line>And having climb&#8217;d the steep-up heavenly hill,</line>
<line>Resembling strong youth in his middle age,</line>
<line>Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still,</line>
<line>Attending on his golden pilgrimage:</line>
<line>But when from highmost pitch, with weary car,</line>
<line>Like feeble age he reeleth from the day,</line>
<line>The eyes (&#8217;fore duteous) now converted are</line>
<line>From his low tract and look another way:</line>
<couplet>So thou, thyself outgoing in thy noon,</couplet>
<couplet>Unlook&#8217;d on diest unless thou get a son.</couplet>
</sonnet>

<sonnet>
<sonnetnum>8</sonnetnum>
<line>Music to hear, why hear&#8217;st thou music sadly?</line>
<line>Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy.</line>
<line>Why lov&#8217;st thou that which thou receiv&#8217;st not gladly,</line>
<line>Or else receiv&#8217;st with pleasure thine annoy?</line>
<line>If the true concord of well-tuned sounds,</line>
<line>By unions married, do offend thine ear,</line>
<line>They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds</line>
<line>In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear.</line>
<line>Mark how one string, sweet husband to another,</line>
<line>Strikes each in each by mutual ordering;</line>
<line>Resembling sire, and child, and happy mother,</line>
<line>Who all in one, one pleasing note do sing:</line>
<couplet>Whose speechless song, being many, seeming one,</couplet>
<couplet>Sings this to thee,  &#8220;Thou single wilt prove none.&#8221;</couplet>
</sonnet>

<sonnet>
<sonnetnum>9</sonnetnum>
<line>Is it for fear to wet a widow&#8217;s eye</line>
<line>That thou consum&#8217;st thyself in single life?</line>
<line>Ah! If thou issueless shalt hap to die,</line>
<line>The world will wail thee like a makeless wife,</line>
<line>The world will be thy widow and still weep,</line>
<line>That thou no form of thee hast left behind,</line>
<line>When every private widow well may keep,</line>
<line>By children&#8217;s eyes, her husband&#8217;s shape in mind.</line>
<line>Look what an unthrift in the world doth spend</line>
<line>Shifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it,</line>
<line>But beauty&#8217;s waste hath in the world an end,</line>
<line>And kept unus&#8217;d, the user so destroys it:</line>
<couplet>No love toward others in that bosom sits</couplet>
<couplet>That on himself such murd&#8217;rous shame commits.</couplet>
</sonnet>

<sonnet>
<sonnetnum>10</sonnetnum>
<line>For shame deny that thou bear&#8217;st love to any,</line>
<line>Who for thyself art so unprovident.</line>
<line>Grant, if thou wilt, thou art belov&#8217;d of many,</line>
<line>But that thou none lov&#8217;st is most evident;</line>
<line>For thou art so possess&#8217;d with murd&#8217;rous hate,</line>
<line>That &#8217;gainst thyself thou stick&#8217;st not to conspire,</line>
<line>Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate</line>
<line>Which to repair should be thy chief desire.</line>
<line>O, change thy thought, that I may change my mind!</line>
<line>Shall hate be fairer lodg&#8217;d than gentle love?</line>
<line>Be as thy presence is gracious and kind,</line>
<line>Or to thyself at least kind-hearted prove:</line>
<couplet>Make thee another self for love of me,</couplet>
<couplet>That beauty still may live in thine or thee.</couplet>
</sonnet>

<sonnet>
<sonnetnum>11</sonnetnum>
<line>As fast as thou shalt wane, so fast thou grow&#8217;st,</line>
<line>In one of thine, from that which thou departest,</line>
<line>And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow&#8217;st</line>
<line>Thou mayst call thine, when thou from youth convertest.</line>
<line>Herein lives wisdom, beauty, and increase,</line>
<line>Without this, folly, age, and cold decay.</line>
<line>If all were minded so, the times should cease,</line>
<line>And threescore year would make the world away.</line>
<line>Let those whom nature hath not made for store,</line>
<line>Harsh, featureless, and rude, barrenly perish:</line>
<line>Look whom she best endow&#8217;d she gave the more;</line>
<line>Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish.</line>
<couplet>She carv&#8217;d thee for her seal, and meant thereby,</couplet>
<couplet>Thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die.</couplet>
</sonnet>

<sonnet>
<sonnetnum>12</sonnetnum>
<line>When I do count the clock that tells the time,</line>
<line>And see the brave day sunk in hideous night;</line>
<line>When I behold the violet past prime,</line>
<line>And sable curls all silver&#8217;d o&#8217;er with white;</line>
<line>When lofty trees I see barren of leaves,</line>
<line>Which erst from heat did canopy the herd,</line>
<line>And summer&#8217;s green all girded up in sheaves</line>
<line>Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard:</line>
<line>Then of thy beauty do I question make</line>
<line>That thou among the wastes of time must go,</line>
<line>Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake,</line>
<line>And die as fast as they see others grow,</line>
<couplet>And nothing &#8217;gainst Time&#8217;s scythe can make defense</couplet>
<couplet>Save breed, to brave him when he takes thee hence.</couplet>
</sonnet>

<sonnet>
<sonnetnum>13</sonnetnum>
<line>O that you were yourself! But, love, you are</line>
<line>No longer yours than you yourself here live:</line>
<line>Against this coming end you should prepare,</line>
<line>And your sweet semblance to some other give.</line>
<line>So should that beauty which you hold in lease</line>
<line>Find no determination; then you were</line>
<line>Yourself again after yourself&#8217;s decease,</line>
<line>When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear.</line>
<line>Who lets so fair a house fall to decay,</line>
<line>Which husbandry in honor might uphold</line>
<line>Against the stormy gusts of winter&#8217;s day</line>
<line>And barren rage of death&#8217;s eternal cold?</line>
<couplet>O, none but unthrifts: dear my love, you know</couplet>
<couplet>You had a father, let your son say so.</couplet>
</sonnet>

<sonnet>
<sonnetnum>14</sonnetnum>
<line>Not from the stars do I my judgment pluck,</line>
<line>And yet methinks I have astronomy,</line>
<line>But not to tell of good or evil luck,</line>
<line>Of plagues, of dearths, or seasons&#8217; quality;</line>
<line>Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell,</line>
<line>&#8217;Pointing to each his thunder, rain, and wind,</line>
<line>Or say with princes if it shall go well</line>
<line>By oft predict that I in heaven find.</line>
<line>But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,</line>
<line>And, constant stars, in them I read such art</line>
<line>As truth and beauty shall together thrive</line>
<line>If from thyself to store thou wouldst convert;</line>
<couplet>Or else of thee this I prognosticate,</couplet>
<couplet>Thy end is truth&#8217;s and beauty&#8217;s doom and date.</couplet>
</sonnet>

<sonnet>
<sonnetnum>15</sonnetnum>
<line>When I consider every thing that grows</line>
<line>Holds in perfection but a little moment;</line>
<line>That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows</line>
<line>Whereon the stars in secret influence comment;</line>
<line>When I perceive that men as plants increase,</line>
<line>Cheered and check&#8217;d even by the self-same sky,</line>
<line>Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,</line>
<line>And wear their brave state out of memory:</line>
<line>Then the conceit of this inconstant stay</line>
<line>Sets you most rich in youth before my sight,</line>
<line>Where wasteful Time debateth with Decay</line>
<line>To change your day of youth to sullied night,</line>
<couplet>And all in war with Time for love of you,</couplet>
<couplet>As he takes from you, I ingraft you new.</couplet>
</sonnet>

<sonnet>
<sonnetnum>16</sonnetnum>
<line>But wherefore do not you a mightier way</line>
<line>Make war upon this bloody tyrant Time?</line>
<line>And fortify yourself in your decay</line>
<line>With means more blessed than my barren rhyme?</line>
<line>Now stand you on the top of happy hours,</line>
<line>And many maiden gardens, yet unset,</line>
<line>With virtuous wish would bear your living flowers,</line>
<line>Much liker than your painted counterfeit:</line>
<line>So should the lines of life that life repair</line>
<line>Which this time&#8217;s pencil, or my pupil pen,</line>
<line>Neither in inward worth nor outward fair</line>
<line>Can make you live yourself in eyes of men.</line>
<couplet>To give away yourself keeps yourself still,</couplet>
<couplet>And you must live drawn by your own sweet skill.</couplet>
</sonnet>

<sonnet>
<sonnetnum>17</sonnetnum>
<line>Who will believe my verse in time to come</line>
<line>If it were fill&#8217;d with your most high deserts?</line>
<line>Though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb</line>
<line>Which hides your life, and shows not half your parts.</line>
<line>If I could write the beauty of your eyes,</line>
<line>And in fresh numbers number all your graces,</line>
<line>The age to come would say, &#8220;This poet lies,</line>
<line>Such heavenly touches ne&#8217;er touch&#8217;d earthly faces.&#8221;</line>
<line>So should my papers (yellowed with their age)</line>
<line>Be scorn&#8217;d, like old men of less truth than tongue,</line>
<line>And your true rights be term&#8217;d a poet&#8217;s rage,</line>
<line>And stretched metre of an antique song:</line>
<couplet>But were some child of yours alive that time,</couplet>
<couplet>You should live twice, in it and in my rhyme.</couplet>
</sonnet>

<sonnet>
<sonnetnum>18</sonnetnum>
<line>Shall I compare thee to a summer&#8217;s day?</line>
<line>Thou art more lovely and more temperate:</line>
<line>Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,</line>
<line>And summer&#8217;s lease hath all too short a date;</line>
<line>Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,</line>
<line>And often is his gold complexion dimm&#8217;d,</line>
<line>And every fair from fair sometime declines,</line>
<line>By chance or nature&#8217;s changing course untrimm&#8217;d:</line>
<line>But thy eternal summer shall not fade,</line>
<line>Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow&#8217;st,</line>
<line>Nor shall Death brag thou wand&#8217;rest in his shade,</line>
<line>When in eternal lines to time thou grow&#8217;st.</line>
<couplet>So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,</couplet>
<couplet>So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.</couplet>
</sonnet>

<sonnet>
<sonnetnum>19</sonnetnum>
<line>Devouring Time, blunt thou the lion&#8217;s paws,</line>
<line>And make the earth devour her own sweet brood;</line>
<line>Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger&#8217;s jaws,</line>
<line>And burn the long-liv&#8217;d phoenix in her blood;</line>
<line>Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleet&#8217;st,</line>
<line>And do what e&#8217;er thou wilt, swift-footed Time,</line>
<line>To the wide world and all her fading sweets:</line>
<line>But I forbid thee one most heinous crime,</line>
<line>O, carve not with thy hours my love&#8217;s fair brow,</line>
<line>Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen;</line>
<line>Him in thy course untainted do allow,</line>
<line>For beauty&#8217;s pattern to succeeding men.</line>
<couplet>Yet do thy worst, old Time: despite thy wrong,</couplet>
<couplet>My love shall in my verse ever live young.</couplet>
</sonnet>

<sonnet>
<sonnetnum>20</sonnetnum>
<line>A woman&#8217;s face with Nature&#8217;s own hand painted</line>
<line>Hast thou, the master mistress of my passion;</line>
<line>A woman&#8217;s gentle heart but not acquainted</line>
<line>With shifting change as is false women&#8217;s fashion;</line>
<line>An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling,</line>
<line>Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth;</line>
<line>A man in hue all hues in his controlling,</line>
<line>Which steals men&#8217;s eyes and women&#8217;s souls amazeth.</line>
<line>And for a woman wert thou first created,</line>
<line>Till Nature as she wrought thee fell a-doting,</line>
<line>And by addition me of thee defeated,</line>
<line>By adding one thing to my purpose nothing.</line>
<couplet>But since she prick&#8217;d thee out for women&#8217;s pleasure,</couplet>
<couplet>Mine be thy love, and thy love&#8217;s use their treasure.</couplet>
</sonnet>



<sonnet>
<sonnetnum>21</sonnetnum>
<line>So is it not with me as with that Muse</line>
<line>Stirr&#8217;d by a painted beauty to his verse,</line>
<line>Who heaven itself for ornament doth use,</line>
<line>And every fair with his fair doth rehearse,</line>
<line>Making a couplement of proud compare</line>
<line>With sun and moon, with earth and sea&#8217;s rich gems,</line>
<line>With April&#8217;s first-born flowers, and all things rare</line>
<line>That heaven&#8217;s air in this huge rondure hems.</line>
<line>O, let me, true in love, but truly write,</line>
<line>And then believe me, my love is as fair</line>
<line>As any mother&#8217;s child, though not so bright</line>
<line>As those gold candles fix&#8217;d in heaven&#8217;s air:</line>
<couplet>Let them say more that like of hearsay well,</couplet>
<couplet>I will not praise that purpose not to sell.</couplet>
</sonnet>

<sonnet>
<sonnetnum>22</sonnetnum>
<line>My glass shall not persuade me I am old,</line>
<line>So long as youth and thou are of one date,</line>
<line>But when in thee time&#8217;s furrows I behold,</line>
<line>Then look I death my days should expiate.</line>
<line>For all that beauty that doth cover thee</line>
<line>Is but the seemly raiment of my heart,</line>
<line>Which in thy breast doth live, as thine in me:</line>
<line>How can I then be elder than thou art?</line>
<line>O, therefore, love, be of thyself so wary</line>
<line>As I, not for myself, but for thee will,</line>
<line>Bearing thy heart, which I will keep so chary</line>
<line>As tender nurse her babe from faring ill.</line>
<couplet>Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain,</couplet>
<couplet>Thou gav&#8217;st me thine not to give back again.</couplet>
</sonnet>

<sonnet>
<sonnetnum>23</sonnetnum>
<line>As an unperfect actor on the stage,</line>
<line>Who with his fear is put besides his part,</line>
<line>Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,</line>
<line>Whose strength&#8217;s abundance weakens his own heart,</line>
<line>So I, for fear of trust, forget to say</line>
<line>The perfect ceremony of love&#8217;s rite,</line>
<line>And in mine own love&#8217;s strength seem to decay,</line>
<line>O&#8217;ercharg&#8217;d with burden of mine own love&#8217;s might.</line>
<line>O, let my books be then the eloquence</line>
<line>And dumb presagers of my speaking breast,</line>
<line>Who plead for love, and look for recompense,</line>
<line>More than that tongue that more hath more express&#8217;d.</line>
<couplet>O, learn to read what silent love hath writ:</couplet>
<couplet>To hear with eyes belongs to love&#8217;s fine wit.</couplet>
</sonnet>

<sonnet>
<sonnetnum>24</sonnetnum>
<line>Mine eye hath play&#8217;d the painter and hath stell&#8217;d</line>
<line>Thy beauty&#8217;s form in table of my heart;</line>
<line>My body is the frame wherein &#8217;tis held,</line>
<line>And perspective it is best painter&#8217;s art.</line>
<line>For through the painter must you see his skill,</line>
<line>To find where your true image pictur&#8217;d lies,</line>
<line>Which in my bosom&#8217;s shop is hanging still,</line>
<line>That hath his windows glazed with thine eyes.</line>
<line>Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done:</line>
<line>Mine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for me</line>
<line>Are windows to my breast, wherethrough the sun</line>
<line>Delights to peep, to gaze therein on thee.</line>
<couplet>Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art,</couplet>
<couplet>They draw but what they see, know not the heart.</couplet>
</sonnet>

<sonnet>
<sonnetnum>25</sonnetnum>
<line>Let those who are in favor with their stars</line>
<line>Of public honor and proud titles boast,</line>
<line>Whilst I whom fortune of such triumph bars</line>
<line>Unlook&#8217;d for joy in that I honor most.</line>
<line>Great princes&#8217; favorites their fair leaves spread</line>
<line>But as the marigold at the sun&#8217;s eye,</line>
<line>And in themselves their pride lies buried,</line>
<line>For at a frown they in their glory die.</line>
<line>The painful warrior famoused for fight,</line>
<line>After a thousand victories once foil&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Is from the book of honor rased quite,</line>
<line>And all the rest forgot for which he toil&#8217;d.</line>
<couplet>Then happy I that love and am beloved</couplet>
<couplet>Where I may not remove, nor be removed.</couplet>
</sonnet>

<sonnet>
<sonnetnum>26</sonnetnum>
<line>Lord of my love, to whom in vassalage</line>
<line>Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit,</line>
<line>To thee I send this written ambassage</line>
<line>To witness duty, not to show my wit;</line>
<line>Duty so great, which wit so poor as mine</line>
<line>May make seem bare, in wanting words to show it,</line>
<line>But that I hope some good conceit of thine</line>
<line>In thy soul&#8217;s thought (all naked) will bestow it;</line>
<line>Till whatsoever star that guides my moving</line>
<line>Points on me graciously with fair aspect,</line>
<line>And puts apparel on my tattered loving,</line>
<line>To show me worthy of thy sweet respect:</line>
<couplet>Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee,</couplet>
<couplet>Till then, not show my head where thou mayst prove me.</couplet>
</sonnet>

<sonnet>
<sonnetnum>27</sonnetnum>
<line>Weary with toil, I haste me to my bed,</line>

<line>My heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie</line>
<line>(A closet never pierc&#8217;d with crystal eyes),</line>
<line>But the defendant doth that plea deny,</line>
<line>And says in him thy fair appearance lies.</line>
<line>To &#8217;cide this title is impanelled</line>
<line>A quest of thoughts, all tenants to the heart,</line>
<line>And by their verdict is determined</line>
<line>The clear eye&#8217;s moiety and the dear heart&#8217;s part—</line>

<line>With my love&#8217;s picture then my eye doth feast,</line>
<line>And to the painted banquet bids my heart;</line>
<line>Another time mine eye is my heart&#8217;s guest,</line>
<line>And in his thoughts of love doth share a part.</line>
<line>So either by thy picture or my love,</line>
<line>Thyself away are present still with me,</line>
<line>For thou not farther than my thoughts canst move,</line>
<line>And I am still with them, and they with thee;</line>

<line>The bloody spur cannot provoke him on,</line>
<line>That sometimes anger thrusts into his hide,</line>
<line>Which heavily he answers with a groan,</line>

<line>Thus can my love excuse the slow offense</line>

<line>Till I return, of posting is no need.</line>
<line>O, what excuse will my poor beast then find,</line>
<line>When swift extremity can seem but slow?</line>
<line>Then should I spur though mounted on the wind,</line>
<line>In winged speed no motion shall I know.</line>
<line>Then can no horse with my desire keep pace;</line>
<line>Therefore desire (of perfect&#8217;st love being made)</line>
<line>Shall neigh (no dull flesh) in his fiery race,</line>
<line>But love, for love, thus shall excuse my jade:</line>

<line>He robs thee of, and pays it thee again.</line>
<line>He lends thee virtue, and he stole that word</line>

<line>I found (or thought I found) you did exceed</line>
<line>The barren tender of a poet&#8217;s debt;</line>
<line>And therefore have I slept in your report,</line>
<line>That you yourself, being extant, well might show</line>
<line>How far a modern quill doth come too short,</line>
<line>Speaking of worth, what worth in you doth grow.</line>
<line>This silence for my sin you did impute,</line>
<line>Which shall be most my glory being dumb,</line>
<line>For I impair not beauty being mute,</line>
<line>When others would give life and bring a tomb.</line>
<couplet>There lives more life in one of your fair eyes</couplet>
<couplet>Than both your poets can in praise devise.</couplet>

<sonnet>
<sonnetnum>84</sonnetnum>
<line>Who is it that says most, which can say more</line>
<line>Than this rich praise, that you alone are you,</line>
<line>In whose confine immured is the store</line>
<line>Which should example where your equal grew?</line>
<line>Lean penury within that pen doth dwell</line>
<line>That to his subject lends not some small glory,</line>
<line>But he that writes of you, if he can tell</line>
<line>That you are you, so dignifies his story.</line>
<line>Let him but copy what in you is writ,</line>
<line>Not making worse what nature made so clear,</line>
<line>And such a counterpart shall fame his wit,</line>
<line>Making his style admired every where.</line>
<couplet>You to your beauteous blessings add a curse,</couplet>
<couplet>Being fond on praise, which makes your praises worse.</couplet>

<sonnet>
<sonnetnum>85</sonnetnum>
<line>My tongue-tied Muse in manners holds her still,</line>
<line>While comments of your praise, richly compil&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Reserve their character with golden quill</line>
<line>And precious phrase by all the Muses fil&#8217;d.</line>
<line>I think good thoughts whilst other write good words,</line>
<line>And like unlettered clerk still cry  &#8220;Amen&#8221;</line>
<line>To every hymn that able spirit affords</line>
<line>In polish&#8217;d form of well-refined pen.</line>
<line>Hearing you prais&#8217;d, I say, &#8220;&#8217;Tis so, &#8217;tis true,&#8221;</line>
<line>And to the most of praise add something more,</line>
<line>But that is in my thought, whose love to you</line>
<line>(Though words come hindmost) holds his rank before.</line>
<couplet>Then others for the breath of words respect,</couplet>
<couplet>Me for my dumb thoughts, speaking in effect.</couplet>

<line>Was it the proud full sail of his great verse,</line>
<line>Bound for the prize of all-too-precious you,</line>
<line>That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse,</line>
<line>Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew?</line>
<line>Was it his spirit, by spirits taught to write</line>
<line>Above a mortal pitch, that struck me dead?</line>
<line>No, neither he, nor his compeers by night</line>
<line>Giving him aid, my verse astonished.</line>
<line>He, nor that affable familiar ghost</line>
<line>Which nightly gulls him with intelligence,</line>
<line>As victors of my silence cannot boast;</line>
<line>I was not sick of any fear from thence:</line>
<couplet>But when your countenance fill&#8217;d up his line,</couplet>

<line>Farewell, thou art too dear for my possessing,</line>
<line>And like enough thou know&#8217;st thy estimate;</line>
<line>The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing;</line>
<line>My bonds in thee are all determinate.</line>
<line>For how do I hold thee but by thy granting,</line>
<line>And for that riches where is my deserving?</line>
<line>The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting,</line>
<line>And so my patent back again is swerving.</line>
<line>Thyself thou gav&#8217;st, thy own worth then not knowing,</line>
<line>Or me, to whom thou gav&#8217;st it, else mistaking,</line>
<line>So thy great gift, upon misprision growing,</line>
<line>Comes home again, on better judgment making.</line>
<couplet>Thus have I had thee as a dream doth flatter:</couplet>
<couplet>In sleep a king, but waking no such matter.</couplet>

<line>When thou shalt be dispos&#8217;d to set me light,</line>

<line>Upon thy side against myself I&#8217;ll fight,</line>
<line>And prove thee virtuous, though thou art forsworn.</line>
<line>With mine own weakness being best acquainted,</line>
<line>Upon thy part I can set down a story</line>
<line>Of faults conceal&#8217;d, wherein I am attainted,</line>
<line>That thou in losing me shall win much glory.</line>
<line>And I by this will be a gainer too,</line>
<line>For bending all my loving thoughts on thee,</line>
<line>The injuries that to myself I do,</line>
<line>Doing thee vantage, double-vantage me.</line>
<couplet>Such is my love, to thee I so belong,</couplet>
<couplet>That for thy right myself will bear all wrong.</couplet>

<sonnet>
<sonnetnum>89</sonnetnum>
<line>Say that thou didst forsake me for some fault,</line>
<line>And I will comment upon that offense;</line>
<line>Speak of my lameness, and I straight will halt,</line>
<line>Against thy reasons making no defense.</line>
<line>Thou canst not, love, disgrace me half so ill,</line>
<line>To set a form upon desired change,</line>
<line>As I&#8217;ll myself disgrace, knowing thy will:</line>
<line>I will acquaintance strangle and look strange,</line>
<line>Be absent from thy walks, and in my tongue</line>
<line>Thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell,</line>
<line>Lest I (too much profane) should do it wrong,</line>
<line>And haply of our old acquaintance tell.</line>
<couplet>For thee, against myself I&#8217;ll vow debate,</couplet>
<couplet>For I must ne&#8217;er love him whom thou dost hate.</couplet>

<sonnet>
<sonnetnum>90</sonnetnum>
<line>Then hate me when thou wilt, if ever, now,</line>
<line>Now while the world is bent my deeds to cross,</line>
<line>Join with the spite of fortune, make me bow,</line>
<line>And do not drop in for an after-loss.</line>
<line>Ah, do not, when my heart hath scap&#8217;d this sorrow,</line>
<line>Come in the rearward of a conquer&#8217;d woe;</line>
<line>Give not a windy night a rainy morrow,</line>
<line>To linger out a purpos&#8217;d overthrow.</line>
<line>If thou wilt leave me, do not leave me last,</line>
<line>When other petty griefs have done their spite,</line>
<line>But in the onset come, so shall I taste</line>
<line>At first the very worst of fortune&#8217;s might;</line>
<couplet>And other strains of woe, which now seem woe,</couplet>
<couplet>Compar&#8217;d with loss of thee will not seem so.</couplet>

<line>And every humor hath his adjunct pleasure,</line>
<line>Wherein it finds a joy above the rest,</line>
<line>But these particulars are not my measure,</line>
<line>All these I better in one general best.</line>
<line>Thy love is better than high birth to me,</line>
<line>Richer than wealth, prouder than garments&#8217; cost,</line>
<line>Of more delight than hawks or horses be;</line>

<line>Then need I not to fear the worst of wrongs,</line>
<line>When in the least of them my life hath end;</line>
<line>I see a better state to me belongs</line>
<line>Than that which on thy humor doth depend.</line>
<line>Thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind,</line>
<line>Since that my life on thy revolt doth lie;</line>
<line>O, what a happy title do I find,</line>
<line>Happy to have thy love, happy to die!</line>
<couplet>But what&#8217;s so blessed-fair that fears no blot?</couplet>
<couplet>Thou mayst be false, and yet I know it not.</couplet>

<line>So shall I live, supposing thou art true,</line>

<line>May still seem love to me, though alter&#8217;d new:</line>
<line>Thy looks with me, thy heart in other place.</line>

<line>In many&#8217;s looks the false heart&#8217;s history</line>
<line>Is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange;</line>
<line>But heaven in thy creation did decree</line>
<line>That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell;</line>
<line>What e&#8217;er thy thoughts or thy heart&#8217;s workings be,</line>
<line>Thy looks should nothing thence but sweetness tell.</line>
<couplet>How like Eve&#8217;s apple doth thy beauty grow,</couplet>

<line>That tongue that tells the story of thy days</line>

<line>Yet nor the lays of birds, nor the sweet smell</line>

<line>Could make me any summer&#8217;s story tell,</line>
<line>Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew;</line>
<line>Nor did I wonder at the lily&#8217;s white,</line>
<line>Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose,</line>
<line>They were but sweet, but figures of delight,</line>
<line>Drawn after you, you pattern of all those.</line>
<couplet>Yet seem&#8217;d it winter still, and, you away,</couplet>

<line>The forward violet thus did I chide:</line>
<line>Sweet thief, whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells,</line>

<line>Which on thy soft cheek for complexion dwells</line>
<line>In my love&#8217;s veins thou hast too grossly dy&#8217;d.</line>
<line>The lily I condemned for thy hand,</line>
<line>And buds of marjerom had stol&#8217;n thy hair;</line>
<line>The roses fearfully on thorns did stand,</line>
<line>One blushing shame, another white despair;</line>
<line>A third, nor red nor white, had stol&#8217;n of both,</line>
<line>And to his robb&#8217;ry had annex&#8217;d thy breath,</line>
<line>But for his theft in pride of all his growth</line>
<line>A vengeful canker eat him up to death.</line>
<couplet>More flowers I noted, yet I none could see</couplet>

<line>Dark&#8217;ning thy pow&#8217;r to lend base subjects light?</line>
<line>Return, forgetful Muse, and straight redeem</line>
<line>In gentle numbers time so idly spent;</line>

<line>Rise, resty Muse, my love&#8217;s sweet face survey,</line>

<line>O truant Muse, what shall be thy amends</line>
<line>For thy neglect of truth in beauty dy&#8217;d?</line>
<line>Both truth and beauty on my love depends;</line>
<line>So dost thou too, and therein dignified.</line>
<line>Make answer, Muse, wilt thou not haply say,</line>
<line>&#8220;Truth needs no color with his color fix&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Beauty no pencil, beauty&#8217;s truth to lay;</line>
<line>But best is best, if never intermix&#8217;d&#8221;?</line>
<line>Because he needs no praise, wilt thou be dumb?</line>
<line>Excuse not silence so, for&#8217;t lies in thee</line>
<line>To make him much outlive a gilded tomb,</line>
<line>And to be prais&#8217;d of ages yet to be.</line>
<couplet>Then do thy office, Muse; I teach thee how</couplet>
<couplet>To make him seem long hence, as he shows now.</couplet>

<sonnetnum>102</sonnetnum>
<line>My love is strength&#8217;ned, though more weak in seeming,</line>
<line>I love not less, though less the show appear;</line>
<line>That love is merchandiz&#8217;d whose rich esteeming</line>
<line>The owner&#8217;s tongue doth publish every where.</line>
<line>Our love was new, and then but in the spring,</line>
<line>When I was wont to greet it with my lays,</line>
<line>As Philomel in summer&#8217;s front doth sing,</line>
<line>And stops her pipe in growth of riper days:</line>
<line>Not that the summer is less pleasant now</line>
<line>Than when her mournful hymns did hush the night,</line>
<line>But that wild music burdens every bough,</line>
<line>And sweets grown common lose their dear delight.</line>
<couplet>Therefore like her, I sometime hold my tongue,</couplet>
<couplet>Because I would not dull you with my song.</couplet>

<line>Alack, what poverty my Muse brings forth,</line>
<line>That having such a scope to show her pride,</line>

<line>O, blame me not if I no more can write!</line>
<line>Look in your glass, and there appears a face</line>
<line>That overgoes my blunt invention quite,</line>
<line>Dulling my lines, and doing me disgrace.</line>
<line>Were it not sinful then, striving to mend,</line>
<line>To mar the subject that before was well?</line>
<line>For to no other pass my verses tend</line>
<line>Than of your graces and your gifts to tell;</line>
<couplet>And more, much more than in my verse can sit,</couplet>
<couplet>Your own glass shows you, when you look in it.</couplet>

<line>To me, fair friend, you never can be old,</line>
<line>For as you were when first your eye I ey&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Such seems your beauty still. Three winters cold</line>
<line>Have from the forests shook three summers&#8217; pride,</line>
<line>Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turn&#8217;d</line>
<line>In process of the seasons have I seen,</line>
<line>Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burn&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Since first I saw you fresh, which yet are green.</line>
<line>Ah, yet doth beauty, like a dial hand,</line>
<line>Steal from his figure, and no pace perceiv&#8217;d,</line>
<line>So your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand,</line>
<line>Hath motion, and mine eye may be deceiv&#8217;d;</line>
<couplet>For fear of which, hear this, thou age unbred:</couplet>
<couplet>Ere you were born was beauty&#8217;s summer dead.</couplet>

<sonnetnum>105</sonnetnum>
<line>Let not my love be call&#8217;d idolatry,</line>
<line>Nor my beloved as an idol show,</line>
<line>Since all alike my songs and praises be</line>
<line>To one, of one, still such, and ever so.</line>
<line>Kind is my love to-day, to-morrow kind,</line>
<line>Still constant in a wondrous excellence,</line>
<line>Therefore my verse, to constancy confin&#8217;d,</line>
<line>One thing expressing, leaves out difference.</line>
<line>&#8220;Fair,&#8221; &#8220;kind,&#8221; and &#8220;true&#8221; is all my argument,</line>
<line>&#8220;Fair,&#8221; &#8220;kind,&#8221; and &#8220;true&#8221; varying to other words,</line>
<line>And in this change is my invention spent,</line>
<line>Three themes in one, which wondrous scope affords.</line>
<couplet>&#8220;Fair,&#8221; &#8220;kind,&#8221; and &#8220;true&#8221; have often liv&#8217;d alone,</couplet>

<line>When in the chronicle of wasted time</line>
<line>I see descriptions of the fairest wights,</line>
<line>And beauty making beautiful old rhyme</line>
<line>In praise of ladies dead and lovely knights,</line>
<line>Then in the blazon of sweet beauty&#8217;s best,</line>
<line>Of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow,</line>
<line>I see their antique pen would have express&#8217;d</line>
<line>Even such a beauty as you master now.</line>
<line>So all their praises are but prophecies</line>
<line>Of this our time, all you prefiguring,</line>
<line>And for they look&#8217;d but with divining eyes,</line>
<line>They had not still enough your worth to sing:</line>
<couplet>For we which now behold these present days</couplet>
<couplet>Have eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to praise.</couplet>

<sonnet>
<sonnetnum>107</sonnetnum>
<line>Not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul</line>
<line>Of the wide world, dreaming on things to come,</line>
<line>Can yet the lease of my true love control,</line>
<line>Suppos&#8217;d as forfeit to a confin&#8217;d doom.</line>
<line>The mortal moon hath her eclipse endur&#8217;d,</line>
<line>And the sad augurs mock their own presage,</line>
<line>Incertainties now crown themselves assur&#8217;d,</line>
<line>And peace proclaims olives of endless age.</line>
<line>Now with the drops of this most balmy time</line>
<line>My love looks fresh, and Death to me subscribes,</line>
<line>Since spite of him I&#8217;ll live in this poor rhyme,</line>
<line>While he insults o&#8217;er dull and speechless tribes;</line>
<couplet>And thou in this shalt find thy monument,</couplet>
<couplet>When tyrants&#8217; crests and tombs of brass are spent.</couplet>

<line>What&#8217;s in the brain that ink may character</line>

<line>What&#8217;s new to speak, what now to register,</line>
<line>That may express my love, or thy dear merit?</line>
<line>Nothing, sweet boy, but yet like prayers divine,</line>
<line>I must each day say o&#8217;er the very same,</line>
<line>Counting no old thing old, thou mine, I thine,</line>
<line>Even as when first I hallowed thy fair name.</line>
<line>So that eternal love in love&#8217;s fresh case</line>
<line>Weighs not the dust and injury of age,</line>
<line>Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place,</line>
<line>But makes antiquity for aye his page,</line>
<couplet>Finding the first conceit of love there bred,</couplet>
<couplet>Where time and outward form would show it dead.</couplet>

<line>Alas, &#8217;tis true, I have gone here and there,</line>
<line>And made myself a motley to the view,</line>
<line>Gor&#8217;d mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear,</line>
<line>Made old offenses of affections new;</line>
<line>Most true it is that I have look&#8217;d on truth</line>
<line>Askaunce and strangely: but by all above,</line>
<line>These blenches gave my heart another youth,</line>
<line>And worse essays prov&#8217;d thee my best of love.</line>
<line>Now all is done, have what shall have no end,</line>
<line>Mine appetite I never more will grind</line>
<line>On newer proof, to try an older friend,</line>
<line>A god in love, to whom I am confin&#8217;d.</line>

<line>O, for my sake do you with Fortune chide,</line>
<line>The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds,</line>
<line>That did not better for my life provide</line>
<line>Than public means which public manners breeds.</line>
<line>Thence comes it that my name receives a brand,</line>
<line>And almost thence my nature is subdu&#8217;d</line>
<line>To what it works in, like the dyer&#8217;s hand.</line>
<line>Pity me then, and wish I were renew&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Whilst like a willing patient I will drink</line>
<line>Potions of eisel &#8217;gainst my strong infection,</line>
<line>No bitterness that I will bitter think,</line>
<line>Nor double penance, to correct correction.</line>
<couplet>Pity me then, dear friend, and I assure ye,</couplet>

<line>Your love and pity doth th&#8217; impression fill</line>

<line>So you o&#8217;er-green my bad, my good allow?</line>
<line>You are my all the world, and I must strive</line>
<line>To know my shames and praises from your tongue;</line>
<line>None else to me, nor I to none alive,</line>
<line>That my steel&#8217;d sense or changes right or wrong.</line>
<line>In so profound abysm I throw all care</line>
<line>Of others&#8217; voices, that my adder&#8217;s sense</line>

<line>Since I left you, mine eye is in my mind,</line>
<line>And that which governs me to go about</line>
<line>Doth part his function, and is partly blind,</line>
<line>Seems seeing, but effectually is out;</line>
<line>For it no form delivers to the heart</line>
<line>Of bird, of flow&#8217;r, or shape which it doth latch,</line>
<line>Of his quick objects hath the mind no part,</line>
<line>Nor his own vision holds what it doth catch;</line>
<line>For if it see the rud&#8217;st or gentlest sight,</line>
<line>The most sweet favor or deformed&#8217;st creature,</line>
<line>The mountain or the sea, the day or night,</line>
<line>The crow or dove, it shapes them to your feature.</line>
<couplet>Incapable of more, replete with you,</couplet>
<couplet>My most true mind thus maketh mine untrue.</couplet>

<line>To make of monsters and things indigest</line>
<line>Such cherubins as your sweet self resemble,</line>
<line>Creating every bad a perfect best</line>
<line>As fast as objects to his beams assemble?</line>
<line>O, &#8217;tis the first, &#8217;tis flatt&#8217;ry in my seeing,</line>
<line>And my great mind most kingly drinks it up;</line>
<line>Mine eye well knows what with his gust is &#8217;greeing,</line>
<line>And to his palate doth prepare the cup.</line>
<couplet>If it be poison&#8217;d, &#8217;tis the lesser sin</couplet>

<line>My most full flame should afterwards burn clearer.</line>
<line>But reckoning Time, whose million&#8217;d accidents</line>
<line>Creep in &#8217;twixt vows, and change decrees of kings,</line>
<line>Tan sacred beauty, blunt the sharp&#8217;st intents,</line>
<line>Divert strong minds to th&#8217; course of alt&#8217;ring things:</line>
<line>Alas, why, fearing of Time&#8217;s tyranny,</line>
<line>Might I not then say, &#8220;Now I love you best,&#8221;</line>
<line>When I was certain o&#8217;er incertainty,</line>
<line>Crowning the present, doubting of the rest?</line>
<couplet>Love is a babe, then might I not say so,</couplet>

<line>Let me not to the marriage of true minds</line>

<line>Which alters when it alteration finds,</line>
<line>Or bends with the remover to remove.</line>
<line>O no, it is an ever-fixed mark</line>
<line>That looks on tempests and is never shaken;</line>
<line>It is the star to every wand&#8217;ring bark,</line>
<line>Whose worth&#8217;s unknown, although his highth be taken.</line>
<line>Love&#8217;s not Time&#8217;s fool, though rosy lips and cheeks</line>
<line>Within his bending sickle&#8217;s compass come,</line>
<line>Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,</line>
<line>But bears it out even to the edge of doom.</line>
<couplet>If this be error and upon me proved,</couplet>

<line>Accuse me thus: that I have scanted all</line>
<line>Wherein I should your great deserts repay,</line>
<line>Forgot upon your dearest love to call,</line>
<line>Whereto all bonds do tie me day by day;</line>
<line>That I have frequent been with unknown minds,</line>
<line>And given to time your own dear-purchas&#8217;d right;</line>
<line>That I have hoisted sail to all the winds</line>
<line>Which should transport me farthest from your sight.</line>
<line>Book both my willfulness and errors down,</line>
<line>And on just proof surmise accumulate;</line>
<line>Bring me within the level of your frown,</line>
<line>But shoot not at me in your wakened hate:</line>
<couplet>Since my appeal says I did strive to prove</couplet>
<couplet>The constancy and virtue of your love.</couplet>

<line>Like as to make our appetites more keen,</line>
<line>With eager compounds we our palate urge,</line>
<line>As to prevent our maladies unseen,</line>
<line>We sicken to shun sickness when we purge;</line>
<line>Even so being full of your ne&#8217;er-cloying sweetness,</line>
<line>To bitter sauces did I frame my feeding,</line>
<line>And sick of welfare, found a kind of meetness</line>
<line>To be diseas&#8217;d ere that there was true needing.</line>
<line>Thus policy in love, t&#8217; anticipate</line>
<line>The ills that were not, grew to faults assured,</line>
<line>And brought to medicine a healthful state</line>
<line>Which, rank of goodness, would by ill be cured.</line>
<couplet>But thence I learn, and find the lesson true,</couplet>
<couplet>Drugs poison him that so fell sick of you.</couplet>

<line>What potions have I drunk of Siren tears</line>

<line>What wretched errors hath my heart committed,</line>
<line>Whilst it hath thought itself so blessed never!</line>
<line>How have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted</line>
<line>In the distraction of this madding fever!</line>
<line>O benefit of ill, now I find true</line>
<line>That better is by evil still made better,</line>
<line>And ruin&#8217;d love when it is built anew</line>
<line>Grows fairer than at first, more strong, far greater.</line>

<line>For why should others&#8217; false adulterate eyes</line>
<line>Give salutation to my sportive blood?</line>
<line>Or on my frailties why are frailer spies,</line>
<line>Which in their wills count bad what I think good?</line>
<line>No, I am that I am, and they that level</line>

<line>They are but dressings of a former sight.</line>
<line>Our dates are brief, and therefore we admire</line>
<line>What thou dost foist upon us that is old,</line>

<line>Than think that we before have heard them told.</line>
<line>Thy registers and thee I both defy,</line>
<line>Not wond&#8217;ring at the present, nor the past,</line>

<line>Sweet beauty hath no name, no holy bow&#8217;r,</line>

<line>Why of eyes&#8217; falsehood hast thou forged hooks,</line>
<line>Whereto the judgment of my heart is tied?</line>
<line>Why should my heart think that a several plot,</line>
<line>Which my heart knows the wide world&#8217;s common place?</line>
<line>Or mine eyes seeing this, say this is not,</line>
<line>To put fair truth upon so foul a face?</line>
<couplet>In things right true my heart and eyes have erred,</couplet>
<couplet>And to this false plague are they now transferred.</couplet>
</sonnet>

<sonnet>
<sonnetnum>138</sonnetnum>
<line>When my love swears that she is made of truth,</line>
<line>I do believe her, though I know she lies,</line>
<line>That she might think me some untutor&#8217;d youth,</line>
<line>Unlearned in the world&#8217;s false subtilties.</line>
<line>Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young,</line>
<line>Although she knows my days are past the best,</line>
<line>Simply I credit her false-speaking tongue;</line>
<line>On both sides thus is simple truth suppress&#8217;d.</line>
<line>But wherefore says she not she is unjust?</line>
<line>And wherefore say not I that I am old?</line>
<line>O, love&#8217;s best habit is in seeming trust,</line>
<line>And age in love loves not t&#8217; have years told.</line>
<couplet>Therefore I lie with her, and she with me,</couplet>
<couplet>And in our faults by lies we flattered be.</couplet>
</sonnet>

<sonnet>
<sonnetnum>139</sonnetnum>
<line>O, call not me to justify the wrong</line>
<line>That thy unkindness lays upon my heart,</line>
<line>Wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue,</line>
<line>Use power with power, and slay me not by art.</line>
<line>Tell me thou lov&#8217;st elsewhere, but in my sight,</line>
<line>Dear heart, forbear to glance thine eye aside;</line>
<line>What need&#8217;st thou wound with cunning when thy might</line>
<line>Is more than my o&#8217;erpress&#8217;d defense can bide?</line>
<line>Let me excuse thee: ah, my love well knows</line>
<line>Her pretty looks have been mine enemies,</line>
<line>And therefore from my face she turns my foes,</line>
<line>That they elsewhere might dart their injuries:</line>
<couplet>Yet do not so, but since I am near slain,</couplet>
<couplet>Kill me outright with looks, and rid my pain.</couplet>
</sonnet>

<sonnet>
<sonnetnum>140</sonnetnum>
<line>Be wise as thou art cruel, do not press</line>
<line>My tongue-tied patience with too much disdain,</line>
<line>Lest sorrow lend me words, and words express</line>
<line>The manner of my pity-wanting pain.</line>
<line>If I might teach thee wit, better it were,</line>
<line>Though not to love, yet, love, to tell me so,</line>
<line>As testy sick men, when their deaths be near,</line>
<line>No news but health from their physicians know;</line>
<line>For if I should despair, I should grow mad,</line>
<line>And in my madness might speak ill of thee;</line>
<line>Now this ill-wresting world is grown so bad,</line>
<line>Mad slanderers by mad ears believed be.</line>
<couplet>That I may not be so, nor thou belied,</couplet>
<couplet>Bear thine eyes straight, though thy proud heart go wide.</couplet>
</sonnet>

<sonnet>
<sonnetnum>141</sonnetnum>
<line>In faith, I do not love thee with mine eyes,</line>
<line>For they in thee a thousand errors note,</line>
<line>But &#8217;tis my heart that loves what they despise,</line>
<line>Who in despite of view is pleas&#8217;d to dote;</line>
<line>Nor are mine ears with thy tongue&#8217;s tune delighted,</line>
<line>Nor tender feeling to base touches prone,</line>
<line>Nor taste, nor smell, desire to be invited</line>
<line>To any sensual feast with thee alone;</line>
<line>But my five wits nor my five senses can</line>
<line>Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee,</line>
<line>Who leaves unsway&#8217;d the likeness of a man,</line>
<line>Thy proud heart&#8217;s slave and vassal wretch to be:</line>
<couplet>Only my plague thus far I count my gain,</couplet>
<couplet>That she that makes me sin awards me pain.</couplet>
</sonnet>

<sonnet>
<sonnetnum>142</sonnetnum>
<line>Love is my sin, and thy dear virtue hate,</line>
<line>Hate of my sin, grounded on sinful loving:</line>
<line>O, but with mine compare thou thine own state,</line>
<line>And thou shalt find it merits not reproving,</line>
<line>Or if it do, not from those lips of thine,</line>
<line>That have profan&#8217;d their scarlet ornaments,</line>
<line>And seal&#8217;d false bonds of love as oft as mine,</line>
<line>Robb&#8217;d others&#8217; beds&#8217; revenues of their rents.</line>
<line>Be it lawful I love thee as thou lov&#8217;st those</line>
<line>Whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee.</line>
<line>Root pity in thy heart, that when it grows,</line>
<line>Thy pity may deserve to pitied be.</line>
<couplet>If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide,</couplet>
<couplet>By self-example mayst thou be denied.</couplet>
</sonnet>

<sonnet>
<sonnetnum>143</sonnetnum>
<line>Lo as a careful huswife runs to catch</line>
<line>One of her feathered creatures broke away,</line>
<line>Sets down her babe and makes all swift dispatch</line>
<line>In pursuit of the thing she would have stay;</line>
<line>Whilst her neglected child holds her in chase,</line>
<line>Cries to catch her whose busy care is bent</line>
<line>To follow that which flies before her face,</line>
<line>Not prizing her poor infant&#8217;s discontent;</line>
<line>So run&#8217;st thou after that which flies from thee,</line>
<line>Whilst I, thy babe, chase thee afar behind,</line>
<line>But if thou catch thy hope, turn back to me,</line>
<line>And play the mother&#8217;s part, kiss me, be kind.</line>
<couplet>So will I pray that thou mayst have thy Will,</couplet>
<couplet>If thou turn back and my loud crying still.</couplet>
</sonnet>

<sonnet>
<sonnetnum>144</sonnetnum>
<line>Two loves I have of comfort and despair,</line>
<line>Which like two spirits do suggest me still:</line>
<line>The better angel is a man right fair,</line>
<line>The worser spirit a woman color&#8217;d ill.</line>
<line>To win me soon to hell, my female evil</line>
<line>Tempteth my better angel from my side,</line>
<line>And would corrupt my saint to be a devil,</line>
<line>Wooing his purity with her foul pride.</line>
<line>And whether that my angel be turn&#8217;d fiend</line>
<line>Suspect I may, yet not directly tell,</line>
<line>But being both from me, both to each friend,</line>
<line>I guess one angel in another&#8217;s hell.</line>
<couplet>Yet this shall I ne&#8217;er know, but live in doubt,</couplet>
<couplet>Till my bad angel fire my good one out.</couplet>
</sonnet>

<sonnet>
<sonnetnum>145</sonnetnum>
<line>Those lips that Love&#8217;s own hand did make</line>
<line>Breath&#8217;d forth the sound that said  &#8220;I hate&#8221;</line>
<line>To me that languish&#8217;d for her sake;</line>
<line>But when she saw my woeful state,</line>
<line>Straight in her heart did mercy come,</line>
<line>Chiding that tongue that, ever sweet,</line>
<line>Was us&#8217;d in giving gentle doom,</line>
<line>And taught it thus anew to greet:</line>
<line>&#8220;I hate&#8221; she alter&#8217;d with an end</line>
<line>That follow&#8217;d it as gentle day</line>
<line>Doth follow night, who like a fiend</line>
<line>From heaven to hell is flown away:</line>
<couplet>&#8217;I hate&#8217; from hate away she threw,</couplet>
<couplet>And sav&#8217;d my life, saying &#8220;not you.&#8221;</couplet>
</sonnet>

<sonnet>
<sonnetnum>146</sonnetnum>
<line>Poor soul, the centre of my sinful earth,</line>
<line>(...) these rebel pow&#8217;rs that thee array,</line>
<line>Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth,</line>
<line>Painting thy outward walls so costly gay?</line>
<line>Why so large cost, having so short a lease,</line>
<line>Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend?</line>
<line>Shall worms, inheritors of this excess,</line>
<line>Eat up thy charge? Is this thy body&#8217;s end?</line>
<line>Then, soul, live thou upon thy servant&#8217;s loss,</line>
<line>And let that pine to aggravate thy store;</line>
<line>Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross;</line>
<line>Within be fed, without be rich no more:</line>
<couplet>So shalt thou feed on Death, that feeds on men,</couplet>
<couplet>And Death once dead, there&#8217;s no more dying then.</couplet>
</sonnet>

<sonnet>
<sonnetnum>147</sonnetnum>
<line>My love is as a fever, longing still</line>
<line>For that which longer nurseth the disease,</line>
<line>Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill,</line>
<line>Th&#8217; uncertain sickly appetite to please.</line>
<line>My reason, the physician to my love,</line>
<line>Angry that his prescriptions are not kept,</line>
<line>Hath left me, and I desperate now approve</line>
<line>Desire is death, which physic did except.</line>
<line>Past cure I am, now reason is past care,</line>
<line>And frantic mad with evermore unrest;</line>
<line>My thoughts and my discourse as madmen&#8217;s are,</line>
<line>At randon from the truth vainly express&#8217;d;</line>
<couplet>For I have sworn thee fair, and thought thee bright,</couplet>
<couplet>Who art as black as hell, as dark as night.</couplet>
</sonnet>

<sonnet>
<sonnetnum>148</sonnetnum>
<line>O me! What eyes hath Love put in my head,</line>
<line>Which have no correspondence with true sight,</line>
<line>Or if they have, where is my judgment fled,</line>
<line>That censures falsely what they see aright?</line>
<line>If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote,</line>
<line>What means the world to say it is not so?</line>
<line>If it be not, then love doth well denote</line>
<line>Love&#8217;s eye is not so true as all men&#8217;s: no,</line>
<line>How can it? O, how can Love&#8217;s eye be true,</line>
<line>That is so vex&#8217;d with watching and with tears?</line>
<line>No marvel then though I mistake my view,</line>
<line>The sun itself sees not till heaven clears.</line>
<couplet>O cunning Love, with tears thou keep&#8217;st me blind,</couplet>
<couplet>Lest eyes well seeing thy foul faults should find.</couplet>
</sonnet>

<sonnet>
<sonnetnum>149</sonnetnum>
<line>Canst thou, O cruel, say I love thee not,</line>
<line>When I against myself with thee partake?</line>
<line>Do I not think on thee when I forgot</line>
<line>Am of myself, all tyrant for thy sake?</line>
<line>Who hateth thee that I do call my friend?</line>
<line>On whom frown&#8217;st thou that I do fawn upon?</line>
<line>Nay, if thou low&#8217;r&#8217;st on me, do I not spend</line>
<line>Revenge upon myself with present moan?</line>
<line>What merit do I in myself respect,</line>
<line>That is so proud thy service to despise,</line>
<line>When all my best doth worship thy defect,</line>
<line>Commanded by the motion of thine eyes?</line>
<couplet>But, love, hate on, for now I know thy mind:</couplet>
<couplet>Those that can see thou lov&#8217;st, and I am blind.</couplet>
</sonnet>

<sonnet>
<sonnetnum>150</sonnetnum>
<line>O, from what pow&#8217;r hast thou this pow&#8217;rful might</line>
<line>With insufficiency my heart to sway,</line>
<line>To make me give the lie to my true sight,</line>
<line>And swear that brightness doth not grace the day?</line>
<line>Whence hast thou this becoming of things ill,</line>
<line>That in the very refuse of thy deeds</line>
<line>There is such strength and warrantise of skill</line>
<line>That in my mind thy worst all best exceeds?</line>
<line>Who taught thee how to make me love thee more,</line>
<line>The more I hear and see just cause of hate?</line>
<line>O, though I love what others do abhor,</line>
<line>With others thou shouldst not abhor my state.</line>
<couplet>If thy unworthiness rais&#8217;d love in me,</couplet>
<couplet>More worthy I to be belov&#8217;d of thee.</couplet>
</sonnet>

<sonnet>
<sonnetnum>151</sonnetnum>
<line>Love is too young to know what conscience is,</line>
<line>Yet who knows not conscience is born of love?</line>
<line>Then, gentle cheater, urge not my amiss,</line>
<line>Lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove:</line>
<line>For thou betraying me, I do betray</line>
<line>My nobler part to my gross body&#8217;s treason;</line>
<line>My soul doth tell my body that he may</line>
<line>Triumph in love; flesh stays no farther reason,</line>
<line>But rising at thy name doth point out thee</line>
<line>As his triumphant prize. Proud of this pride,</line>
<line>He is contented thy poor drudge to be,</line>
<line>To stand in thy affairs, fall by thy side.</line>
<couplet>No want of conscience hold it that I call</couplet>
<couplet>Her &#8220;love&#8221; for whose dear love I rise and fall.</couplet>
</sonnet>

<sonnet>
<sonnetnum>152</sonnetnum>
<line>In loving thee thou know&#8217;st I am forsworn,</line>
<line>But thou art twice forsworn, to me love swearing;</line>
<line>In act thy bed-vow broke, and new faith torn</line>
<line>In vowing new hate after new love bearing.</line>
<line>But why of two oaths&#8217; breach do I accuse thee,</line>
<line>When I break twenty? I am perjur&#8217;d most,</line>
<line>For all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee,</line>
<line>And all my honest faith in thee is lost;</line>
<line>For I have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness,</line>
<line>Oaths of thy love, thy truth, thy constancy,</line>
<line>And to enlighten thee gave eyes to blindness,</line>
<line>Or made them swear against the thing they see;</line>
<couplet>For I have sworn thee fair: more perjur&#8217;d eye,</couplet>
<couplet>To swear against the truth so foul a lie!</couplet>
</sonnet>

<sonnet>
<sonnetnum>153</sonnetnum>
<line>Cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep;</line>
<line>A maid of Dian&#8217;s this advantage found,</line>
<line>And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep</line>
<line>In a cold valley-fountain of that ground;</line>
<line>Which borrow&#8217;d from this holy fire of Love</line>
<line>A dateless lively heat, still to endure,</line>
<line>And grew a seething bath, which yet men prove</line>
<line>Against strange maladies a sovereign cure.</line>
<line>But at my mistress&#8217; eye Love&#8217;s brand new fired,</line>
<line>The boy for trial needs would touch my breast;</line>
<line>I sick withal the help of bath desired,</line>
<line>And thither hied, a sad distemper&#8217;d guest;</line>
<couplet>But found no cure: the bath for my help lies</couplet>
<couplet>Where Cupid got new fire&#8212;my mistress&#8217; eyes.</couplet>
</sonnet>

<sonnet>
<sonnetnum>154</sonnetnum>
<line>The little Love-god, lying once asleep,</line>
<line>Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,</line>
<line>Whilst many nymphs that vow&#8217;d chaste life to keep</line>
<line>Came tripping by, but in her maiden hand</line>
<line>The fairest votary took up that fire,</line>
<line>Which many legions of true hearts had warm&#8217;d,</line>
<line>And so the general of hot desire</line>
<line>Was sleeping by a virgin hand disarm&#8217;d.</line>
<line>This brand she quenched in a cool well by,</line>
<line>Which from Love&#8217;s fire took heat perpetual,</line>
<line>Growing a bath and healthful remedy</line>
<line>For men diseas&#8217;d, but I, my mistress&#8217; thrall,</line>
<couplet>Came there for cure, and this by that I prove:</couplet>
<couplet>Love&#8217;s fire heats water, water cools not love.</couplet>
