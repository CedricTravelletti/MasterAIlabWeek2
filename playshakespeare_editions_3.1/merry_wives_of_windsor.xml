</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SLEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will marry her, sir, at your request; but if there be no great love in the beginning, yet heaven may decrease it upon better acquaintance, when we are married and have more occasion to know one another. I hope, upon familiarity will grow more content. But if you say, &#8220;Marry her,&#8221; I will marry her; that I am freely dissolv&#8217;d, and dissolutely.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EVANS.</SPEAKER>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Mistress Page, reading of a letter.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MRS. PAGE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, have I scap&#8217;d love-letters in the holiday-time of my beauty, and am I now a subject for them? Let me see.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Reads.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE><RECITE>&#8220;Ask me no reason why I love you, for though Love use Reason for his precisian, he admits him not for his counsellor. You are not young, no more am I; go to then, there&#8217;s sympathy. You are merry, so am I; ha, ha! Then there&#8217;s more sympathy. You love sack, and so do I; would you desire better sympathy? Let it suffice thee, Mistress Page&#8212;at the least if the love of a soldier can suffice&#8212;that I love thee. I will not say, pity me&#8212;&#8217;tis not a soldier-like phrase&#8212;but I say, love me. By me,</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>Thine own true knight,</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>By day or night,</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>Or any kind of light,</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>With all his might</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>For thee to fight,</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE><RECITE>John Falstaff.&#8221;</RECITE></LINE>
<LINE>What a Herod of Jewry is this! O wicked, wicked world! One that is well-nigh worn to pieces with age to show himself a young gallant! What an unweigh&#8217;d behavior hath this Flemish drunkard pick&#8217;d (with the devil&#8217;s name!) out of my conversation, that he dares in this manner assay me? Why, he hath not been thrice in my company! What should I say to him? I was then frugal of my mirth. Heaven forgive me! Why, I&#8217;ll exhibit a bill in the parliament for the putting down of men. How shall I be reveng&#8217;d on him? For reveng&#8217;d I will be! As sure as his guts are made of puddings.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Mistress Ford.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MRS. FORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Mistress Page, trust me, I was going to your house.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MRS. PAGE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And trust me, I was coming to you. You look very ill.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MRS. FORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, I&#8217;ll ne&#8217;er believe that; I have to show to the contrary.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MRS. PAGE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Faith, but you do, in my mind.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MRS. FORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well&#8212;I do then; yet I say I could show you to the contrary. O Mistress Page, give me some counsel!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MRS. PAGE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What&#8217;s the matter, woman?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MRS. FORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O woman&#8212;if it were not for one trifling respect, I could come to such honor!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MRS. PAGE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hang the trifle, woman, take the honor. What is it? Dispense with trifles. What is it?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MRS. FORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If I would but go to hell for an eternal moment or so, I could be knighted.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MRS. PAGE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What? Thou liest! Sir Alice Ford! These knights will hack, and so thou shouldst not alter the article of thy gentry.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MRS. FORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We burn daylight. Here, read, read; perceive how I might be knighted. I shall think the worse of fat men, as long as I have an eye to make difference of men&#8217;s liking: and yet he would not swear; prais&#8217;d women&#8217;s modesty; and gave such orderly and well-behav&#8217;d reproof to all uncomeliness, that I would have sworn his disposition would have gone to the truth of his words; but they do no more adhere and keep place together than the hundred Psalms to the tune of &#8220;Green-sleeves.&#8221; What tempest, I trow, threw this whale (with so many tuns of oil in his belly) ashore at Windsor? How shall I be reveng&#8217;d on him? I think the best way were to entertain him with hope, till the wicked fire of lust have melted him in his own grease. Did you ever hear the like?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MRS. PAGE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Letter for letter; but that the name of Page and Ford differs! To thy great comfort in this mystery of ill opinions, here&#8217;s the twin-brother of thy letter; but let thine inherit first, for I protest mine never shall. I warrant he hath a thousand of these letters, writ with blank space for different names (sure, more!); and these are of the second edition. He will print them, out of doubt; for he cares not what he puts into the press, when he would put us two. I had rather be a giantess, and lie under Mount Pelion. Well&#8212;I will find you twenty lascivious turtles ere one chaste man.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MRS. FORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, this is the very same: the very hand; the very words. What doth he think of us?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MRS. PAGE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, I know not; it makes me almost ready to wrangle with mine own honesty. I&#8217;ll entertain myself like one that I am not acquainted withal; for sure unless he know some strain in me that I know not myself, he would never have boarded me in this fury.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MRS. FORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8220;Boarding,&#8221; call you it? I&#8217;ll be sure to keep him above deck.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MRS. PAGE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So will I; if he come under my hatches, I&#8217;ll never to sea again. Let&#8217;s be reveng&#8217;d on him: let&#8217;s appoint him a meeting, give him a show of comfort in his suit, and lead him on with a fine-baited delay, till he hath pawn&#8217;d his horses to mine host of the Garter.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MRS. FORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, I will consent to act any villainy against him, that may not sully the chariness of our honesty. O that my husband saw this letter! It would give eternal food to his jealousy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MRS. PAGE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, look where he comes; and my good man too. He&#8217;s as far from jealousy as I am from giving him cause, and that (I hope) is an unmeasurable distance.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MRS. FORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You are the happier woman.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MRS. PAGE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let&#8217;s consult together against this greasy knight. Come hither.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>They retire.</STAGEDIR>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Ford with Pistol; Page with Nym.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, I hope it be not so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PIST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hope is a curtal dog in some affairs. Sir John affects thy wife.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, sir, my wife is not young.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PIST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He woos both high and low, both rich and poor,</LINE>
<LINE>Both young and old, one with another, Ford.</LINE>
<LINE>He loves the gallimaufry, Ford. Perpend.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Love my wife?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PIST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>With liver burning hot. Prevent; or go thou</LINE>
<LINE>Like Sir Actaeon he, with Ringwood at thy heels&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>O, odious is the name!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What name, sir?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PIST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The horn, I say. Farewell.</LINE>
<LINE>Take heed, have open eye, for thieves do foot by night.</LINE>
<LINE>Take heed, ere summer comes or cuckoo-birds do sing.</LINE>
<LINE>Away, Sir Corporal Nym!</LINE>
<LINE>Believe it, Page, he speaks sense.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORD.</SPEAKER>
<STAGEDIR>Aside.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE> I will be patient; I will find out this.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NYM.</SPEAKER>
<STAGEDIR>To Page.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>And this is true; I like not the humor of lying. He hath wrong&#8217;d me in some humors. I should have borne the humor&#8217;d letter to her; but I have a sword, and it shall bite upon my necessity. He loves your wife: there&#8217;s the short and the long. My name is Corporal Nym; I speak, and I avouch; &#8217;tis true; my name is Nym, and Falstaff loves your wife. <FRENCH lang="fr">Adieu</FRENCH>. I love not the humor of bread and cheese and there&#8217;s the humor of it. <FRENCH lang="fr">Adieu</FRENCH>.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAGE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8220;The humor of it,&#8221; quoth &#8217;a! Here&#8217;s a fellow frights English out of his wits.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will seek out Falstaff.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAGE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I never heard such a drawling, affecting rogue.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If I do find it&#8212;well.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAGE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will not believe such a Cataian, though the priest o&#8217; th&#8217; town commended him for a true man.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;Twas a good sensible fellow&#8212;well.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Mrs. Page and Mrs. Ford come forward.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAGE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How now, Meg?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MRS. PAGE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Whither go you, George, hark you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MRS. FORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How now, sweet Frank, why art thou melancholy?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I melancholy? I am not melancholy. Get you home; go.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MRS. FORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Faith, thou hast some crotchets in thy head now. Will you go, Mistress Page?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MRS. PAGE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Have with you. You&#8217;ll come to dinner, George?</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Aside to Mrs. Ford.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Look who comes yonder. She shall be our messenger to this paltry knight.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MRS. FORD.</SPEAKER>
<STAGEDIR>Aside to Mrs. Page.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Trust me, I thought on her. She&#8217;ll fit it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Mistress Quickly.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MRS. PAGE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You are come to see my daughter Anne?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUICK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, forsooth; and I pray, how does good Mistress Anne?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MRS. PAGE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go in with us and see. We have an hour&#8217;s talk with you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt Mrs. Page, Mrs. Ford, and Mrs. Quickly.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAGE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How now, Master Ford?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You heard what this knave told me, did you not?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAGE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, and you heard what the other told me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do you think there is truth in them?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAGE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hang &#8217;em, slaves! I do not think the knight would offer it; but these that accuse him in his intent towards our wives are a yoke of his discarded men&#8212;very rogues, now they be out of service.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Were they his men?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAGE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, were they.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I like it never the better for that. Does he lie at the Garter?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAGE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, marry, does he. If he should intend this voyage toward my wife, I would turn her loose to him; and what he gets more of her than sharp words, let it lie on my head.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do not misdoubt my wife; but I would be loath to turn them together. A man may be too confident. I would have nothing lie on my head. I cannot be thus satisfied.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Host.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAGE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Look where my ranting host of the Garter comes. There is either liquor in his pate, or money in his purse, when he looks so merrily. How now, mine host?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How now, bully-rook? Thou&#8217;rt a gentleman. Cavaleiro Justice, I say!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Shallow.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SHAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I follow, mine host, I follow. Good even and twenty, good Master Page! Master Page, will you go with us? We have sport in hand.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tell him, Cavaleiro Justice; tell him, bully-rook.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SHAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, there is a fray to be fought between Sir Hugh the Welsh priest and Caius the French doctor.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good mine host o&#8217; th&#8217; Garter, a word with you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What say&#8217;st thou, my bully-rook?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Ford and the Host talks.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SHAL.</SPEAKER>
<STAGEDIR>To Page.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Will you go with us to behold it? My merry host hath had the measuring of their weapons, and, I think, hath appointed them contrary places; for, believe me, I hear the parson is no jester. Hark, I will tell you what our sport shall be.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>They converse apart.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hast thou no suit against my knight, my guest-cavalier?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>None, I protest; but I&#8217;ll give you a pottle of burnt sack to give me recourse to him and tell him my name is Brook&#8212;only for a jest.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My hand, bully; thou shalt have egress and regress&#8212;said I well?&#8212;and thy name shall be Brook. It is a merry knight. Will you go, An-heires?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SHAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Have with you, mine host.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAGE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have heard the Frenchman hath good skill in his rapier.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SHAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tut, sir; I could have told you more. In these times you stand on distance: your passes, stoccadoes, and I know not what. &#8217;Tis the heart, Master Page, &#8217;tis here, &#8217;tis here. I have seen the time, with my long sword I would have made you four tall fellows skip like rats.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here, boys, here, here! Shall we wag?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAGE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Have with you. I had rather hear them scold than fight.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt Host, Shallow, and Page.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Though Page be a secure fool, and stands so firmly on his wife&#8217;s frailty, yet I cannot put off my opinion so easily. She was in his company at Page&#8217;s house; and what they made there, I know not. Well, I will look further into&#8217;t, and I have a disguise to sound Falstaff. If I find her honest, I lose not my labor; if she be otherwise, &#8217;tis labor well bestow&#8217;d.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FAL.</SPEAKER>

<LINE>Why then the world&#8217;s mine oyster,</LINE>
<LINE>Which I with sword will open.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not a penny. I have been content, sir, you should lay my countenance to pawn. I have grated upon my good friends for three reprieves for you and your coach-fellow Nym; or else you had look&#8217;d through the grate, like a geminy of baboons. I am damn&#8217;d in hell for swearing to gentlemen my friends, you were good soldiers and tall fellows; and when Mistress Bridget lost the handle of her fan, I took&#8217;t upon mine honor thou hadst it not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PIST.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Didst not thou share? Hadst thou not fifteen pence?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Reason, you rogue, reason; think&#8217;st thou I&#8217;ll endanger my soul gratis? At a word, hang no more about me, I am no gibbet for you. Go&#8212;a short knife and a throng!&#8212;to your manor of Pickt-hatch! Go. You&#8217;ll not bear a letter for me, you rogue? You stand upon your honor! Why, thou unconfinable baseness, it is as much as I can do to keep the terms of my honor precise. I, I, I myself sometimes, leaving the fear of God on the left hand, and hiding mine honor in my necessity, am fain to shuffle, to hedge, and to lurch; and yet you, rogue, will ensconce your rags, your cat-a-mountain looks, your red-lattice phrases, and your bold-beating oaths, under the shelter of your honor! You will not do it? You!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Mistress Ford; come, Mistress Ford&#8212;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUICK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, this is the short and the long of it: you have brought her into such a canaries as &#8217;tis wonderful. The best courtier of them all (when the court lay at Windsor) could never have brought her to such a canary; yet there has been knights, and lords, and gentlemen, with their coaches; I warrant you, coach after coach, letter after letter, gift after gift; smelling so sweetly, all musk, and so rushling, I warrant you, in silk and gold, and in such alligant terms, and in such wine and sugar of the best, and the fairest, that would have won any woman&#8217;s heart; and I warrant you, they could never get an eye-wink of her. I had myself twenty angels given me this morning, but I defy all angels (in any such sort, as they say) but in the way of honesty; and I warrant you, they could never get her so much as sip on a cup with the proudest of them all, and yet there has been earls, nay (which is more) pensioners, but I warrant you all is one with her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But what says she to me? Be brief, my good she-Mercury.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUICK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, she hath receiv&#8217;d your letter&#8212;for the which she thanks you a thousand times&#8212;and she gives you to notify that her husband will be absence from his house between ten and eleven.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ten and eleven?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUICK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, forsooth; and then you may come and see the picture, she says, that you wot of. Master Ford her husband will be from home. Alas, the sweet woman leads an ill life with him. He&#8217;s a very jealousy man. She leads a very frampold life with him, good heart.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ten and eleven. Woman, commend me to her, I will not fail her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUICK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, you say well. But I have another messenger to your worship. Mistress Page hath her hearty commendations to you too; and let me tell you in your ear, she&#8217;s as fartuous a civil modest wife, and one (I tell you) that will not miss you morning nor evening prayer, as any is in Windsor, whoe&#8217;er be the other; and she bade me tell your worship that her husband is seldom from home, but she hopes there will come a time. I never knew a woman so dote upon a man; surely I think you have charms, la; yes, in truth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not I, I assure thee. Setting the attraction of my good parts aside, I have no other charms.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUICK.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That were a jest indeed! They have not so little grace, I hope. That were a trick indeed! But Mistress Page would desire you to send her your little page, of all loves. Her husband has a marvellous infection to the little page; and truly Master Page is an honest man. Never a wife in Windsor leads a better life than she does: do what she will, say what she will, take all, pay all, go to bed when she list, rise when she list, all is as she will; and truly she deserves it, for if there be a kind woman in Windsor, she is one. You must send her your page, no remedy.</LINE>

<LINE>Why, I will.</LINE>

<LINE>Nay, but do so then, and look you, he may come and go between you both; and in any case have a nay-word, that you may know one another&#8217;s mind, and the boy never need to understand any thing; for &#8217;tis not good that children should know any wickedness. Old folks, you know, have discretion, as they say, and know the world.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>FORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, I hear you are a scholar (I will be brief with you), and you have been a man long known to me, though I had never so good means as desire to make myself acquainted with you. I shall discover a thing to you, wherein I must very much lay open mine own imperfection; but, good Sir John, as you have one eye upon my follies, as you hear them unfolded, turn another into the register of your own, that I may pass with a reproof the easier, sith you yourself know how easy it is to be such an offender.</LINE>

<LINE>Very well, sir, proceed.</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have long lov&#8217;d her, and I protest to you, bestow&#8217;d much on her; follow&#8217;d her with a doting observance; engross&#8217;d opportunities to meet her; fee&#8217;d every slight occasion that could but niggardly give me sight of her; not only bought many presents to give her, but have given largely to many to know what she would have given; briefly, I have pursu&#8217;d her as love hath pursu&#8217;d me, which hath been on the wing of all occasions. But whatsoever I have merited, either in my mind or in my means, meed I am sure I have receiv&#8217;d none, unless experience be a jewel&#8212;that I have purchas&#8217;d at an infinite rate, and that hath taught me to say this:</LINE>
<LINE>&#8220;Love like a shadow flies when substance love pursues,</LINE>
<LINE>Pursuing that that flies, and flying what pursues.&#8221;</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Have you receiv&#8217;d no promise of satisfaction at her hands?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Never.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Have you importun&#8217;d her to such a purpose?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Never.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Of what quality was your love then?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Like a fair house built on another man&#8217;s ground, so that I have lost my edifice by mistaking the place where I erected it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To what purpose have you unfolded this to me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>When I have told you that, I have told you all. Some say that, though she appear honest to me, yet in other places she enlargeth her mirth so far that there is shrewd construction made of her. Now, Sir John, here is the heart of my purpose: you are a gentleman of excellent breeding, admirable discourse, of great admittance, authentic in your place and person, generally allow&#8217;d for your many war-like, court-like, and learned preparations.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O sir!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Believe it, for you know it. There is money, spend it, spend it; spend more; spend all I have; only give me so much of your time in exchange of it, as to lay an amiable siege to the honesty of this Ford&#8217;s wife. Use your art of wooing; win her to consent to you; if any man may, you may as soon as any.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Would it apply well to the vehemency of your affection, that I should win what you would enjoy? Methinks you prescribe to yourself very preposterously.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, understand my drift. She dwells so securely on the excellency of her honor, that the folly of my soul dares not present itself; she is too bright to be look&#8217;d against. Now, could I come to her with any detection in my hand, my desires had instance and argument to commend themselves. I could drive her then from the ward of her purity, her reputation, her marriage vow, and a thousand other her defenses, which now are too too strongly embattled against me. What say you to&#8217;t, Sir John?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Master Brook, I will first make bold with your money; next, give me your hand; and last, as I am a gentleman, you shall, and you will, enjoy Ford&#8217;s wife.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O good sir!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FAL.</SPEAKER>

<SPEAKER>FORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Want no money, Sir John, you shall want none.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Want no Mistress Ford, Master Brook, you shall want none. I shall be with her (I may tell you) by her own appointment; even as you came in to me, her assistant or go-between parted from me. I say I shall be with her between ten and eleven; for at that time the jealous rascally knave her husband will be forth. Come you to me at night, you shall know how I speed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am blest in your acquaintance. Do you know Ford, sir?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hang him, poor cuckoldly knave, I know him not. Yet I wrong him to call him poor. They say the jealous wittolly knave hath masses of money, for the which his wife seems to me well-favor&#8217;d. I will use her as the key of the cuckoldly rogue&#8217;s coffer, and there&#8217;s my harvest-home.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would you knew Ford, sir, that you might avoid him if you saw him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hang him, mechanical salt-butter rogue! I will stare him out of his wits; I will awe him with my cudgel; it shall hang like a meteor o&#8217;er the cuckold&#8217;s horns. Master Brook, thou shalt know I will predominate over the peasant, and thou shalt lie with his wife. Come to me soon at night. Ford&#8217;s a knave, and I will aggravate his style; thou, Master Brook, shalt know him for knave, and cuckold. Come to me soon at night.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>FORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What a damn&#8217;d Epicurean rascal is this! My heart is ready to crack with impatience. Who says this is improvident jealousy? My wife hath sent to him, the hour is fix&#8217;d, the match is made. Would any man have thought this? See the hell of having a false woman! My bed shall be abus&#8217;d, my coffers ransack&#8217;d, my reputation gnawn at, and I shall not only receive this villainous wrong, but stand under the adoption of abominable terms, and by him that does me this wrong. Terms! Names! Amaimon sounds well; Lucifer, well; Barbason, well; yet they are devils&#8217; additions, the names of fiends; but Cuckold! Wittol!&#8212;Cuckold! The devil himself hath not such a name. Page is an ass, a secure ass; he will trust his wife, he will not be jealous. I will rather trust a Fleming with my butter, Parson Hugh the Welshman with my cheese, an Irishman with my aqua-vitae bottle, or a thief to walk my ambling gelding, than my wife with herself. Then she plots, then she ruminates, then she devises; and what they think in their hearts they may effect, they will break their hearts but they will effect. God be prais&#8217;d for my jealousy! Eleven o&#8217; clock the hour. I will prevent this, detect my wife, be reveng&#8217;d on Falstaff, and laugh at Page. I will about it; better three hours too soon than a minute too late. Fie, fie, fie! Cuckold, cuckold, cuckold!</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt Mrs. Page and Robin.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Has Page any brains? Hath he any eyes? Hath he any thinking? Sure they sleep, he hath no use of them. Why, this boy will carry a letter twenty mile, as easy as a cannon will shoot point-blank twelve score. He pieces out his wive&#8217;s inclination; he gives her folly motion and advantage; and now she&#8217;s going to my wife, and Falstaff&#8217;s boy with her. A man may hear this show&#8217;r sing in the wind. And Falstaff&#8217;s boy with her! Good plots, they are laid, and our revolted wives share damnation together. Well, I will take him, then torture my wife, pluck the borrow&#8217;d veil of modesty from the so-seeming Mistress Page, divulge Page himself for a secure and willful Actaeon; and to these violent proceedings all my neighbors shall cry aim.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Clock heard.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>The clock gives me my cue, and my assurance bids me search&#8212;there I shall find Falstaff. I shall be rather prais&#8217;d for this than mock&#8217;d; for it is as positive as the earth is firm that Falstaff is there. I will go.</LINE>

<LINE>Not by my consent, I promise you. The gentleman is of no having. He kept company with the wild Prince and Poins; he is of too high a region, he knows too much. No, he shall not knit a knot in his fortunes with the finger of my substance. If he take her, let him take her simply. The wealth I have waits on my consent, and my consent goes not that way.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By the Lord, thou art a tyrant to say so. Thou wouldst make an absolute courtier, and the firm fixture of thy foot would give an excellent motion to thy gait in a semicircled farthingale.

<LINE>And sped you, sir?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Very ill-favoredly, Master Brook.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How so, sir? Did she change her determination?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, Master Brook, but the peaking cornuto her husband, Master Brook, dwelling in a continual &#8217;larum of jealousy, comes me in the instant of our encounter, after we had embrac&#8217;d, kiss&#8217;d, protested, and, as it were, spoke the prologue of our comedy; and at his heels a rabble of his companions, thither provok&#8217;d and instigated by his distemper, and, forsooth, to search his house for his wive&#8217;s love.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What? While you were there?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FAL.</SPEAKER>

<SPEAKER>FORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And did he search for you, and could not find you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You shall hear. As good luck would have it, comes in one Mistress Page; gives intelligence of Ford&#8217;s approach; and in her invention, and Ford&#8217;s wive&#8217;s distraction, they convey&#8217;d me into a buck-basket.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A buck-basket?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By the Lord, a buck-basket! Ramm&#8217;d me in with foul shirts and smocks, socks, foul stockings, greasy napkins, that, Master Brook, there was the rankest compound of villainous smell that ever offended nostril.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FORD.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And how long lay you there?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, you shall hear, Master Brook, what I have suffer&#8217;d to bring this woman to evil for your good. Being thus cramm&#8217;d in the basket, a couple of Ford&#8217;s knaves, his hinds, were call&#8217;d forth by their mistress to carry me in the name of foul clothes to Datchet-lane. They took me on their shoulders; met the jealous knave their master in the door, who ask&#8217;d them once or twice what they had in their basket. I quak&#8217;d for fear, lest the lunatic knave would have search&#8217;d it; but fate (ordaining he should be a cuckold) held his hand. Well, on went he for a search, and away went I for foul clothes. But mark the sequel, Master Brook. I suffer&#8217;d the pangs of three several deaths: first, an intolerable fright, to be detected with a jealious rotten bell-wether; next, to be compass&#8217;d like a good bilbo in the circumference of a peck, hilt to point, heel to head; and then to be stopp&#8217;d in like a strong distillation with stinking clothes that fretted in their own grease. Think of that&#8212;a man of my kidney. Think of that&#8212;that am as subject to heat as butter; a man of continual dissolution and thaw. It was a miracle to scape suffocation. And in the height of this bath (when I was more than half stew&#8217;d in grease, like a Dutch dish) to be thrown into the Thames, and cool&#8217;d, glowing-hot, in that surge, like a horse-shoe; think of that&#8212;hissing-hot&#8212;think of that, Master Brook.</LINE>

<LINE>Hum! Ha? Is this a vision? Is this a dream? Do I sleep? Master Ford, awake! Awake, Master Ford! There&#8217;s a hole made in your best coat, Master Ford. This &#8217;tis to be married! This &#8217;tis to have linen and buck-baskets! Well, I will proclaim myself what I am. I will now take the lecher; he is at my house. He cannot scape me; &#8217;tis impossible he should; he cannot creep into a halfpenny purse, nor into a pepper-box. But lest the devil that guides him should aid him, I will search impossible places. Though what I am I cannot avoid, yet to be what I would not shall not make me tame. If I have horns to make one mad, let the proverb go with me: I&#8217;ll be horn-mad.</LINE>

<LINE>Why, woman, your husband is in his old lines again. He so takes on yonder with my husband; so rails against all married mankind; so curses all Eve&#8217;s daughters, of what complexion soever; and so buffets himself on the forehead, crying, &#8220;Peer out, peer out!&#8221; , that any madness I ever yet beheld seem&#8217;d but tameness, civility, and patience to this his distemper he is in now. I am glad the fat knight is not here.</LINE>

<LINE>Doth all the winter-time, at still midnight,</LINE>
<LINE>Walk round about an oak, with great ragg&#8217;d horns,</LINE>
<LINE>And there he blasts the tree, and takes the cattle,</LINE>
<LINE>And makes milch-kine yield blood, and shakes a chain</LINE>
<LINE>In a most hideous and dreadful manner.</LINE>
<LINE>You have heard of such a spirit, and well you know</LINE>

<LINE>That likewise have we thought upon, and thus:</LINE>

<LINE>Like urchins, ouphes, and fairies, green and white,</LINE>
<LINE>With rounds of waxen tapers on their heads,</LINE>
<LINE>And rattles in their hands. Upon a sudden,</LINE>
<LINE>As Falstaff, she, and I are newly met,</LINE>
<LINE>Let them from forth a sawpit rush at once</LINE>
<LINE>With some diffused song. Upon their sight,</LINE>
<LINE>We two in great amazedness will fly;</LINE>
<LINE>Then let them all encircle him about,</LINE>
<LINE>And fairy-like to pinch the unclean knight;</LINE>
<LINE>And ask him why, that hour of fairy revel,</LINE>
<LINE>In their so sacred paths he dares to tread</LINE>
<LINE>In shape profane.</LINE>

<LINE>That neither, singly, can be manifested</LINE>
<LINE>Without the show of both. Fat Falstaff</LINE>
<LINE>Hath a great scene; the image of the jest</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll show you here at large. Hark, good mine host:</LINE>
<LINE>Tonight at Herne&#8217;s oak, just &#8217;twixt twelve and one,</LINE>
<LINE>Must my sweet Nan present the Fairy Queen;</LINE>
<LINE>The purpose why, is here; in which disguise,</LINE>
<LINE>While other jests are something rank on foot,</LINE>
<LINE>Her father hath commanded her to slip</LINE>
<LINE>Away with Slender, and with him at Eton</LINE>
<LINE>Immediately to marry. She hath consented.</LINE>
<LINE>Now, sir,</LINE>
<LINE>Her mother (even strong against that match</LINE>
<LINE>And firm for Doctor Caius) hath appointed</LINE>
<LINE>That he shall likewise shuffle her away,</LINE>
<LINE>While other sports are tasking of their minds,</LINE>
<LINE>And at the dean&#8217;ry, where a priest attends,</LINE>
<LINE>Straight marry her. To this her mother&#8217;s plot</LINE>
<LINE>She (seemingly obedient) likewise hath</LINE>
<LINE>Made promise to the doctor. Now, thus it rests:</LINE>
<LINE>Her father means she shall be all in white;</LINE>
<LINE>And in that habit, when Slender sees his time</LINE>
<LINE>To take her by the hand and bid her go,</LINE>
<LINE>She shall go with him. Her mother hath intended</LINE>
<LINE>(The better to denote her to the doctor,</LINE>
<LINE>For they must all be mask&#8217;d and vizarded)</LINE>
<LINE>That quaint in green she shall be loose enrob&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>With ribands pendant, flaring &#8217;bout her head;</LINE>
<LINE>And when the doctor spies his vantage ripe,</LINE>
<LINE>To pinch her by the hand, and on that token,</LINE>
<LINE>The maid hath given consent to go with him.</LINE>

<LINE>I went to her, Master Brook, as you see, like a poor old man, but I came from her, Master Brook, like a poor old woman. That same knave Ford, her husband, hath the finest mad devil of jealousy in him, Master Brook, that ever govern&#8217;d frenzy. I will tell you&#8212;he beat me grievously, in the shape of a woman; for in the shape of man, Master Brook, I fear not Goliah with a weaver&#8217;s beam, because I know also life is a shuttle. I am in haste, go along with me, I&#8217;ll tell you all, Master Brook. Since I pluck&#8217;d geese, play&#8217;d truant, and whipt top, I knew not what &#8217;twas to be beaten till lately. Follow me, I&#8217;ll tell you strange things of this knave Ford, on whom tonight I will be reveng&#8217;d, and I will deliver his wife into your hand. Follow. Strange things in hand, Master Brook!

<LINE>The Windsor bell hath strook twelve; the minute draws on. Now the hot-bloodied gods assist me! Remember, Jove, thou wast a bull for thy Europa, love set on thy horns. O powerful love, that in some respects makes a beast a man; in some other, a man a beast. You were also, Jupiter, a swan for the love of Leda. O omnipotent love, how near the god drew to the complexion of a goose! A fault done first in the form of a beast (O Jove, a beastly fault!) and then another fault in the semblance of a fowl&#8212;think on&#8217;t, Jove, a foul fault! When gods have hot backs, what shall poor men do? For me, I am here a Windsor stag, and the fattest, I think, i&#8217; th&#8217; forest.
