<personae playtitle="The Merry Wives of Windsor">

<persona>
<persname short="FAL.">Sir John Falstaff</persname>
<persdescription>Sir John Falstaff is a very fat rogue with no money but many plans to get some. An old, white-bearded man with great self-esteem, he has no doubts about his attractiveness to the ladies, and intends to use this supposed seductiveness to get his hands on some ladies&#8217; gold. Unfortunately for him he does not realize that he is not quite as much of a prize as he thinks, nor that both his targets (Mistress Page and Mistress Ford) are best friends and will show each other everything. He also does not think that his followers might ever turn on him. A great coward, Falstaff will undergo any humiliation to avoid being caught by a jealous husband, whether it is being snuck out in a laundry basket or dressing as a woman and being beaten as a witch. He is a great speaker who can talk himself out of almost any situation and enjoys the sound of his own voice to excess. Having absolutely no sense of morality, he has no qualms about conning people, beating up people who get in his way, and poaching another man&#8217;s deer. A drinker addicted to sack, his main purpose in life is to indulge himself, for which he needs money, the chief end of his endeavors. He is much more easily deceived than he thinks he can be, and he continues to trust the two merry wives as they make a fool of him time and again. Still, he is able to laugh at himself and recognize how well he has been served.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona>
<persname short="FENT.">Fenton</persname>
<persdescription>Master Fenton is a young, good-looking gentleman with a bit of a wild past who became very attracted to Anne Page when he discovered how rich her father is. Having spent most of his own money, he set his cap at her, but has since fallen genuinely in love with the girl. He is kind and rather too easy with his money. He has a wart above one eye.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona>
<persname short="SHAL., ALL PAGE. AND SHAL. AND SLEN.">Robert Shallow</persname>
<persdescription>Justice Robert Shallow is an old and respectable man, if somewhat foolish. A Justice of the Peace, and therefore the chief official of the law in town, he is a rich man with a deer enclosure where he alone is allowed to hunt. He hopes to marry his nephew Slender to Anne Page, and does what he can to push the match further. At times he has to take over the wooing himself, as his nephew is not very adept at the job. Over eighty years old, he remembers his youth fondly, and is delighted to join in with the plot to carry Anne off during the final prank on Falstaff. He thinks himself much more canny than he actually is.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona>
<persname short="FORD.">Francis Ford</persname>
<persdescription>Master Frank Ford is a middle-aged, middle-class gentleman of Windsor afflicted with an almost pathological case of jealousy. Though he trusts his wife Alice with the household finances, he is convinced that she will not hesitate to cheat on him given the least opportunity, an opinion he holds of all women. He cannot understand why other husbands do not see the same risks he does about their wives. His suspicions run so deep that he is quite willing to make a fool of himself, and he disguises himself in order to try and discover via Falstaff whether he is right to be as paranoid as he is. His terror of being cuckolded pushes him into wilder and wilder behavior, and the fact that his neighbors mock him mercilessly each time he can produce no proof of his allegations does nothing to dampen him. He is not a man to do things by halves; when his wife and Mistress Page explain what has been going on, he becomes as extravagant in his apologies as he was in his jealousy. He is prejudiced against foreigners and fortune-tellers. He is a rich man, and willing to risk a fair bit of his money to find out whether his wife is faithful or not; he also buys the disguises for the children who dress as fairies. </persdescription>
</persona>

<persona>
<persname short="PAGE., ALL PAGE. AND SHAL. AND SLEN.">George Page</persname>
<persdescription>Master George Page is a wealthy gentleman of Windsor, married to Mistress Margaret and father of Anne and William. He is well-aware of his place in society and therefore rejects Master Fenton as a husband for his daughter, thinking him too high-born; he prefers a good, solid marriage with a rich man of Windsor, Master Slender. He finds Master Ford&#8217;s jealousy ludicrously over-the-top, and tries to calm him down, without much success. He loves and trusts his wife and is willing to follow her advice in most things, allowing her to be in charge of the family finances. Nevertheless, he tries to act behind her back to get Anne to marry Master Slender, never dreaming that Anne might deceive him and run off with her own choice of husband instead. He is a good-natured fellow who enjoys a good laugh.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona>
<persname short="WILL.">William Page</persname>
<persdescription>William Page is the young son of Master George Page and Mistress Margaret. A schoolboy, he is better at Latin than either of his parents think, though he is not overly enthusiastic about school. Along with his schoolfellows, he dresses up as a fairy to make a mock of Falstaff.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona>
<persname short="EVANS.">Sir Hugh Evans</persname>
<persdescription>Sir Hugh Evans is a Welsh parson and the schoolmaster of Windsor; he has not lost his very heavy accent either in English or in Latin, which is a source of much amusement to the others. A decent fellow, he tries to be a peace-broker in Windsor, though with only mixed success. He also attempts to help Slender&#8217;s suit to Anne Page, with the unfortunate effect of finding himself challenged to a duel by a choleric Frenchman. Though he tries to stiffen his backbone and go through with it, he is terrified at the idea and tries to reassure himself by singing. Evans has the typical teacher&#8217;s love of precise language, and will correct people if he catches them in error; Mistress Quickly&#8217;s mistakes and misunderstands baffle him almost completely. He is deeply concerned by Ford&#8217;s irrational behavior. Impressed by Mistress Page and Mistress Ford&#8217;s ingenuity, he is delighted to join in their final prank on Falstaff, and gets his students to play the fairies for it. Himself disguised, he is the first to press a candle-flame on Sir John. </persdescription>
</persona>

<persona>
<persname short="CAIUS.">Doctor Caius</persname>
<persdescription>Doctor Caius is a French physician, a short-tempered, easily offended man who is wooing Anne Page and does not wish to see anyone else moving in on her. Quick to judgment, he assumes that Evans is hoping to marry Anne himself, and immediately challenges the Welshman to a duel. Dr. Caius has an extremely heavy French accent and is not fully in command of English, which cannot be helped by the fact that his housekeeper is Mistress Quickly, herself not the best user of the language. Mistress Page supports him as Anne&#8217;s husband, and tries to arrange for him to run off with her during the final prank on Falstaff. Unfortunately for him, he is tricked by the girl herself, and ends up being married to a boy. As the local doctor and a man well-connected with the court, he is a respected citizen, despite his bad English and his choleric ways.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona>
<persname short="HOST.">Host of the Garter Inn</persname>
<persdescription>Host of the Garter Inn is a rather merry innkeeper who is incapable of saying anything simply and likes showing off how many words he knows. Though he enjoys mocking foreigners, he likes both Evans and Caius and does not want to see them skewer one another, though he perhaps has too much fun making fools of them to stop their duel. He is not quite cautious enough to avoid having his horses stolen from him by some conmen, and the loss of money that represents leaves him open to Fenton&#8217;s promises of payment if he arranges the young man&#8217;s secret wedding with Anne. He likes playing tricks, for instance introducing the disguised Ford to Falstaff.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona>
<persname short="BARD.">Bardolph</persname>
<persdescription>Bardolph is one of Falstaff&#8217;s followers; when the fat knight can no longer afford to keep his men, he finds Bardolph a job as bartender for the Host. He is a rogue, a conman and a thief, but seems to do his new job honestly enough. He does not realize that the German guests at the inn are conmen themselves until they gallop off with the inn&#8217;s horses.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona>
<persname short="PIST.">Pistol</persname>
<persdescription>Pistol is one of Falstaff&#8217;s followers, a swaggering man who loves the sound of his own voice and is incapable of speaking like a normal human being, instead grandiloquently talking like a hammy actor in a melodrama. He is hot-tempered and seems to be always angling for a fight. He refuses to help Falstaff in his plot against the ladies of Windsor, and instead joins Nim in derailing the plan by telling Ford and Page about Falstaff&#8217;s designs on their wives. Discovering that Mistress Quickly makes a fair bit of money acting as an intermediary in love affairs, he sets his cap at her as a good way of getting the money Falstaff refuses to give him. He dresses up as Hobgoblin for the fairy scene for a chance to get some physical revenge on the knight.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona>
<persname short="NYM.">Nym</persname>
<persdescription>Nym is one of Falstaff&#8217;s followers, and is obsessed with humors. He refuses to help Falstaff with his plans of seduction, and to revenge himself on the fat knight&#8217;s insults convinces Pistol to join him and inform Ford and Page of Falstaff&#8217;s designs on their wives. He has a very one-track mind. He is a conman, who manages to trick Slender out of an expensive chain.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona>
<persname short="ROB.">Robin</persname>
<persdescription>Robin is Falstaff&#8217;s page, but is not the most faithful of servants. Though he brings Falstaff&#8217;s love letters to Mistress Page and Mistress Ford, he is easily convinced by them to turn traitor and lead his master into their trap, despite the fat knight&#8217;s threat of dismissing him from service if he should mention Falstaff&#8217;s planned double-dealing with the ladies. Mistress Page&#8217;s bribing him with new clothes doubtless helps. He is ambitious to be grown, and knows how to flatter a lady.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona>
<persname short="SIM.">Peter Simple</persname>
<persdescription>Peter Simple is Slender&#8217;s servant, an obsequious fellow much impressed by his social betters who must put up with a lot from his foolish master.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona>
<persname short="RUG.">John Rugby</persname>
<persdescription>John Rugby is Dr. Caius&#8217;s servant. He is deeply intimidated by his master.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona>
<persname short="MRS. FORD.">Mistress Alice Ford</persname>
<persdescription>Mistress Alice Ford is a middle-aged lady of Windsor, married to Master Frank Ford. She was quite impressed by Falstaff until he sends her a love letter, at which point she begins to scorn him, and even more so when she discovers that her best friend, Mistress Page, has received exactly the same letter. She is aware that her husband is wildly jealous, and terrified at what will happen if he should discover that Falstaff is wooing her. She agrees with Mistress Page&#8217;s suggestion to trick Falstaff, and sees how this may help her cure Ford&#8217;s jealousy. She sets herself up as the main bait to the fat knight, and acts her role very convincingly. Though her husband is quick to question her fidelity, he trusts her enough to leave her in charge of the family finances &#8212; the main source of Falstaff&#8217;s attraction to her.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona>
<persname short="MRS. PAGE.">Mistress Margaret Page</persname>
<persdescription>Mistress Margaret Page is a middle-aged lady of Windsor who is fond of her husband George, though she has rather different ideas about who should marry their daughter Anne. She is astounded and infuriated to suddenly be wooed by Falstaff, feelings that grow when she discovers that her friend Mistress Ford has received exactly the same love letter she has. She immediately thinks of causing him mischief, and also sees there an opportunity of helping Mistress Ford overcome her husband&#8217;s manic jealousy. An imaginative woman, she is well-respected by all; she is also concerned for her son William&#8217;s education. She is excellent at playing a role, but does not consider that she may have passed this talent on to her daughter, and is therefore taken by surprise when Anne manages to escape and marry the man she wishes rather than the upper-class French Doctor her mother prefers. Mistress Page is trusted and loved by her husband, and is in charge of the family finances &#8212; the main source of Falstaff&#8217;s attraction to her.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona>
<persname short="ANNE.">Mistress Anne Page</persname>
<persdescription>Anne Page is the daughter of Master George Page and Mistress Margaret. A lovely brown-haired girl of marriageable age, she is not enthusiastic about either of her parents&#8217; choices for her husband, though she hopes to get their approval for Master Fenton, whom she prefers. She is rather more intelligent than her suitor Slender, whom she has to put up with because of her father, and has no taste for the French Caius. In the end she is willing to deceive both her parents and the suitors in order to run off with Fenton.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona>
<persname short="QUICK.">Mistress Quickly</persname>
<persdescription>Mistress Quickly is Dr. Caius&#8217;s housekeeper, a foolish woman with a poor command of language, mixing up her English words and unable to identify Latin as a foreign language as opposed to dirty English. As she knows Anne Page, she acts as a go-between for all of her suitors, encouraging all of them and taking credit for any success they have, as she herself has no particular opinion as to which one should gain Anne so long as she gets paid. Mistress Quickly is also used as a go-between by Mistress Page and Mistress Ford to Falstaff, something that makes Pistol realize that she has her value and is worth pursuing. Despite her problems with English, she is able to learn enough good language to play the Queen of the Fairies in the final prank on Falstaff.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona>
<persname short="SLEN., ALL PAGE. AND SHAL. AND SLEN.">Abraham Slender</persname>
<persdescription>Master Abraham Slender is Justice Shallow&#8217;s nephew, a rich and foolish man who wishes to marry Anne Page. Far from being the brightest, he keeps a notebook with good lines to use on women, but forgets to bring it with him and is left dependent on his uncle&#8217;s promptings to try and woo Anne, with limited success. He relies on Shallow for almost everything, and it is his misfortune that his uncle is not much brighter than he is himself. He agrees with Page&#8217;s suggestion that he run off with Anne during the final prank on Falstaff, but never considers that she might trick him. Blond and tall, he has a weak face and a small beard, and struts when he walks.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona>
<persname short="1. SERV.">First Servant</persname>
<persdescription>The First Servant (John) works for the Fords, and removes the rather heavy laundry-basket containing Falstaff at his mistress&#8217; order and dumps its contents in the ditch. He is hopeful that this will not become a regular occurrence.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona>
<persname short="2. SERV.">Second Servant</persname>
<persdescription>The Second Servant (Robert) works for the Fords, and removes the rather heavy laundry-basket containing Falstaff at his mistress&#8217; order and dumps its contents in the ditch. He is hopeful that this will not become a regular occurrence.</persdescription>

<line>Nay, conceive me, conceive me, sweet coz; what I do is to pleasure you, coz. Can you love the maid?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SLEN.</speaker>
<line>I will marry her, sir, at your request; but if there be no great love in the beginning, yet heaven may decrease it upon better acquaintance, when we are married and have more occasion to know one another. I hope, upon familiarity will grow more content. But if you say, &#8220;Marry her,&#8221; I will marry her; that I am freely dissolv&#8217;d, and dissolutely.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>EVANS.</speaker>
<line>It is a fery discretion answer, save the fall is in the ord &#8220;dissolutely.&#8221; The ort is (according to our meaning) &#8220;resolutely.&#8221; His meaning is good.</line>

<speech>

<stagedir>Writes.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>QUICK.</speaker>
<stagedir>Aside to Simple.</stagedir>
<line>I am glad he is so quiet. If he had been throughly mov&#8217;d, you should have heard him so loud and so melancholy. But notwithstanding, man, I&#8217;ll do you your master what good I can; and the very yea and the no is, the French doctor, my master (I may call him my master, look you, for I keep his house; and I wash, wring, brew, bake, scour, dress meat and drink, make the beds, and do all myself)&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SIM.</speaker>
<stagedir>Aside to Quickly.</stagedir>
<line>&#8217;Tis a great charge to come under one body&#8217;s hand.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>QUICK.</speaker>
<stagedir>Aside to Simple.</stagedir>
<line>Are you avis&#8217;d o&#8217; that? You shall find it a great charge; and to be up early and down late; but notwithstanding (to tell you in your ear, I would have no words of it) my master himself is in love with Mistress Anne Page; but notwithstanding that, I know Anne&#8217;s mind&#8212;that&#8217;s neither here nor there.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>CAIUS.</speaker>
<line>You jack&#8217;nape, give-a this letter to Sir Hugh. By gar, it is a shallenge. I will cut his troat in de park; and I will teach a scurvy jack-a-nape priest to meddle or make&#8212;You may be gone; it is not good you tarry here. By gar, I will cut all his two stones; by gar, he shall not have a stone to throw at his dog.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit Simple.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>QUICK.</speaker>
<line>Alas! He speaks but for his friend.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CAIUS.</speaker>
<line>It is no matter-a ver dat. Do not you tell-a me dat I shall have Anne Page for myself? By gar, I vill kill de Jack priest; and I have appointed mine host of de Jarteer to measure our weapon. By gar, I will myself have Anne Page.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>QUICK.</speaker>
<line>Sir, the maid loves you, and all shall be well. We must give folks leave to prate; what the good-jer!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CAIUS.</speaker>
<line>Rugby, come to the court with me. By gar, if I have not Anne Page, I shall turn your head out of my door. Follow my heels, Rugby.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exeunt Caius and Rugby.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>QUICK.</speaker>
<line>You shall have Anne&#8212;fool&#8217;s-head of your own. No, I know Anne&#8217;s mind for that. Never a woman in Windsor knows more of Anne&#8217;s mind than I do, nor can do more than I do with her, I thank heaven.</line>

<line>Who&#8217;s there, I trow? Come near the house, I pray you.</line>

<stagedir>Enter Fenton.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>FENT.</speaker>
<line>How now, good woman, how dost thou?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>QUICK.</speaker>
<line>The better that it pleases your good worship to ask.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FENT.</speaker>
<line>What news? How does pretty Mistress Anne?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>QUICK.</speaker>
<line>In truth, sir, and she is pretty, and honest, and gentle, and one that is your friend; I can tell you that by the way, I praise heaven for it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FENT.</speaker>
<line>Shall I do any good, think&#8217;st thou? Shall I not lose my suit?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>QUICK.</speaker>
<line>Troth, sir, all is in His hands above. But notwithstanding, Master Fenton, I&#8217;ll be sworn on a book she loves you. Have not your worship a wart above your eye?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FENT.</speaker>
<line>Yes, marry, have I, what of that?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>QUICK.</speaker>
<line>Well, thereby hangs a tale. Good faith, it is such another Nan; but (I detest) an honest maid as ever broke bread. We had an hour&#8217;s talk of that wart. I shall never laugh but in that maid&#8217;s company! But, indeed, she is given too much to allicholy and musing; but for you&#8212;well&#8212;go to.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FENT.</speaker>
<line>Well; I shall see her today. Hold, there&#8217;s money for thee. Let me have thy voice in my behalf. If thou seest her before me, commend me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>QUICK.</speaker>
<line>Will I? I&#8217; faith, that we will; and I will tell your worship more of the wart the next time we have confidence, and of other wooers.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FENT.</speaker>
<line>Well, farewell, I am in great haste now.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>QUICK.</speaker>
<line>Farewell to your worship.</line>
<stagedir>Exit Fenton.</stagedir>
<line>Truly, an honest gentleman; but Anne loves him not; for I know Anne&#8217;s mind as well as another does. Out upon&#8217;t! What have I forgot?</line>

<stagedir>Enter Mistress Page, reading of a letter.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>MRS. PAGE.</speaker>
<line>What, have I scap&#8217;d love-letters in the holiday-time of my beauty, and am I now a subject for them? Let me see.</line>
<stagedir>Reads.</stagedir>
<line><RECITE>&#8220;Ask me no reason why I love you, for though Love use Reason for his precisian, he admits him not for his counsellor. You are not young, no more am I; go to then, there&#8217;s sympathy. You are merry, so am I; ha, ha! Then there&#8217;s more sympathy. You love sack, and so do I; would you desire better sympathy? Let it suffice thee, Mistress Page&#8212;at the least if the love of a soldier can suffice&#8212;that I love thee. I will not say, pity me&#8212;&#8217;tis not a soldier-like phrase&#8212;but I say, love me. By me,</RECITE></line>
<line><RECITE>Thine own true knight,</RECITE></line>
<line><RECITE>By day or night,</RECITE></line>
<line><RECITE>Or any kind of light,</RECITE></line>
<line><RECITE>With all his might</RECITE></line>
<line><RECITE>For thee to fight,</RECITE></line>
<line><RECITE>John Falstaff.&#8221;</RECITE></line>
<line>What a Herod of Jewry is this! O wicked, wicked world! One that is well-nigh worn to pieces with age to show himself a young gallant! What an unweigh&#8217;d behavior hath this Flemish drunkard pick&#8217;d (with the devil&#8217;s name!) out of my conversation, that he dares in this manner assay me? Why, he hath not been thrice in my company! What should I say to him? I was then frugal of my mirth. Heaven forgive me! Why, I&#8217;ll exhibit a bill in the parliament for the putting down of men. How shall I be reveng&#8217;d on him? For reveng&#8217;d I will be! As sure as his guts are made of puddings.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Mistress Ford.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>MRS. FORD.</speaker>
<line>Mistress Page, trust me, I was going to your house.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MRS. PAGE.</speaker>
<line>And trust me, I was coming to you. You look very ill.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MRS. FORD.</speaker>
<line>Nay, I&#8217;ll ne&#8217;er believe that; I have to show to the contrary.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MRS. PAGE.</speaker>
<line>Faith, but you do, in my mind.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MRS. FORD.</speaker>
<line>Well&#8212;I do then; yet I say I could show you to the contrary. O Mistress Page, give me some counsel!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MRS. PAGE.</speaker>
<line>What&#8217;s the matter, woman?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MRS. FORD.</speaker>
<line>O woman&#8212;if it were not for one trifling respect, I could come to such honor!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MRS. PAGE.</speaker>
<line>Hang the trifle, woman, take the honor. What is it? Dispense with trifles. What is it?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MRS. FORD.</speaker>
<line>If I would but go to hell for an eternal moment or so, I could be knighted.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MRS. PAGE.</speaker>
<line>What? Thou liest! Sir Alice Ford! These knights will hack, and so thou shouldst not alter the article of thy gentry.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MRS. FORD.</speaker>
<line>We burn daylight. Here, read, read; perceive how I might be knighted. I shall think the worse of fat men, as long as I have an eye to make difference of men&#8217;s liking: and yet he would not swear; prais&#8217;d women&#8217;s modesty; and gave such orderly and well-behav&#8217;d reproof to all uncomeliness, that I would have sworn his disposition would have gone to the truth of his words; but they do no more adhere and keep place together than the hundred Psalms to the tune of &#8220;Green-sleeves.&#8221; What tempest, I trow, threw this whale (with so many tuns of oil in his belly) ashore at Windsor? How shall I be reveng&#8217;d on him? I think the best way were to entertain him with hope, till the wicked fire of lust have melted him in his own grease. Did you ever hear the like?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MRS. PAGE.</speaker>
<line>Letter for letter; but that the name of Page and Ford differs! To thy great comfort in this mystery of ill opinions, here&#8217;s the twin-brother of thy letter; but let thine inherit first, for I protest mine never shall. I warrant he hath a thousand of these letters, writ with blank space for different names (sure, more!); and these are of the second edition. He will print them, out of doubt; for he cares not what he puts into the press, when he would put us two. I had rather be a giantess, and lie under Mount Pelion. Well&#8212;I will find you twenty lascivious turtles ere one chaste man.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MRS. FORD.</speaker>
<line>Why, this is the very same: the very hand; the very words. What doth he think of us?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MRS. PAGE.</speaker>
<line>Nay, I know not; it makes me almost ready to wrangle with mine own honesty. I&#8217;ll entertain myself like one that I am not acquainted withal; for sure unless he know some strain in me that I know not myself, he would never have boarded me in this fury.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MRS. FORD.</speaker>
<line>&#8220;Boarding,&#8221; call you it? I&#8217;ll be sure to keep him above deck.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MRS. PAGE.</speaker>
<line>So will I; if he come under my hatches, I&#8217;ll never to sea again. Let&#8217;s be reveng&#8217;d on him: let&#8217;s appoint him a meeting, give him a show of comfort in his suit, and lead him on with a fine-baited delay, till he hath pawn&#8217;d his horses to mine host of the Garter.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MRS. FORD.</speaker>
<line>Nay, I will consent to act any villainy against him, that may not sully the chariness of our honesty. O that my husband saw this letter! It would give eternal food to his jealousy.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MRS. PAGE.</speaker>
<line>Why, look where he comes; and my good man too. He&#8217;s as far from jealousy as I am from giving him cause, and that (I hope) is an unmeasurable distance.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MRS. FORD.</speaker>
<line>You are the happier woman.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MRS. PAGE.</speaker>
<line>Let&#8217;s consult together against this greasy knight. Come hither.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>They retire.</stagedir>

<stagedir>Enter Ford with Pistol; Page with Nym.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>FORD.</speaker>
<line>Well, I hope it be not so.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PIST.</speaker>
<line>Hope is a curtal dog in some affairs. Sir John affects thy wife.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FORD.</speaker>
<line>Why, sir, my wife is not young.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PIST.</speaker>
<line>He woos both high and low, both rich and poor,</line>
<line>Both young and old, one with another, Ford.</line>
<line>He loves the gallimaufry, Ford. Perpend.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FORD.</speaker>
<line>Love my wife?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PIST.</speaker>
<line>With liver burning hot. Prevent; or go thou</line>
<line>Like Sir Actaeon he, with Ringwood at thy heels&#8212;</line>
<line>O, odious is the name!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FORD.</speaker>
<line>What name, sir?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PIST.</speaker>
<line>The horn, I say. Farewell.</line>
<line>Take heed, have open eye, for thieves do foot by night.</line>
<line>Take heed, ere summer comes or cuckoo-birds do sing.</line>
<line>Away, Sir Corporal Nym!</line>
<line>Believe it, Page, he speaks sense.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit.</stagedir>

<stagedir>Aside.</stagedir>
<line> I will be patient; I will find out this.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NYM.</speaker>
<stagedir>To Page.</stagedir>
<line>And this is true; I like not the humor of lying. He hath wrong&#8217;d me in some humors. I should have borne the humor&#8217;d letter to her; but I have a sword, and it shall bite upon my necessity. He loves your wife: there&#8217;s the short and the long. My name is Corporal Nym; I speak, and I avouch; &#8217;tis true; my name is Nym, and Falstaff loves your wife. <french xml:lang="fr">Adieu</french>. I love not the humor of bread and cheese and there&#8217;s the humor of it. <french xml:lang="fr">Adieu</french>.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>PAGE.</speaker>
<line>&#8220;The humor of it,&#8221; quoth &#8217;a! Here&#8217;s a fellow frights English out of his wits.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>FORD.</speaker>
<line>I will seek out Falstaff.</line>
</speech>

<speech>

<line>I never heard such a drawling, affecting rogue.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FORD.</speaker>
<line>If I do find it&#8212;well.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAGE.</speaker>
<line>I will not believe such a Cataian, though the priest o&#8217; th&#8217; town commended him for a true man.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FORD.</speaker>
<line>&#8217;Twas a good sensible fellow&#8212;well.</line>

<stagedir>Mrs. Page and Mrs. Ford come forward.</stagedir>

<line>How now, Meg?</line>

<speech>
<speaker>MRS. PAGE.</speaker>
<line>Whither go you, George, hark you?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MRS. FORD.</speaker>
<line>How now, sweet Frank, why art thou melancholy?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FORD.</speaker>
<line>I melancholy? I am not melancholy. Get you home; go.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MRS. FORD.</speaker>
<line>Faith, thou hast some crotchets in thy head now. Will you go, Mistress Page?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MRS. PAGE.</speaker>
<line>Have with you. You&#8217;ll come to dinner, George?</line>
<stagedir>Aside to Mrs. Ford.</stagedir>
<line>Look who comes yonder. She shall be our messenger to this paltry knight.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MRS. FORD.</speaker>
<stagedir>Aside to Mrs. Page.</stagedir>
<line>Trust me, I thought on her. She&#8217;ll fit it.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Mistress Quickly.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>MRS. PAGE.</speaker>
<line>You are come to see my daughter Anne?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>QUICK.</speaker>
<line>Ay, forsooth; and I pray, how does good Mistress Anne?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MRS. PAGE.</speaker>
<line>Go in with us and see. We have an hour&#8217;s talk with you.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exeunt Mrs. Page, Mrs. Ford, and Mrs. Quickly.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>PAGE.</speaker>
<line>How now, Master Ford?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FORD.</speaker>
<line>You heard what this knave told me, did you not?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAGE.</speaker>
<line>Yes, and you heard what the other told me?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FORD.</speaker>
<line>Do you think there is truth in them?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAGE.</speaker>
<line>Hang &#8217;em, slaves! I do not think the knight would offer it; but these that accuse him in his intent towards our wives are a yoke of his discarded men&#8212;very rogues, now they be out of service.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FORD.</speaker>
<line>Were they his men?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAGE.</speaker>
<line>Marry, were they.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FORD.</speaker>
<line>I like it never the better for that. Does he lie at the Garter?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAGE.</speaker>
<line>Ay, marry, does he. If he should intend this voyage toward my wife, I would turn her loose to him; and what he gets more of her than sharp words, let it lie on my head.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FORD.</speaker>
<line>I do not misdoubt my wife; but I would be loath to turn them together. A man may be too confident. I would have nothing lie on my head. I cannot be thus satisfied.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Host.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>PAGE.</speaker>
<line>Look where my ranting host of the Garter comes. There is either liquor in his pate, or money in his purse, when he looks so merrily. How now, mine host?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HOST.</speaker>
<line>How now, bully-rook? Thou&#8217;rt a gentleman. Cavaleiro Justice, I say!</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Shallow.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>SHAL.</speaker>
<line>I follow, mine host, I follow. Good even and twenty, good Master Page! Master Page, will you go with us? We have sport in hand.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HOST.</speaker>
<line>Tell him, Cavaleiro Justice; tell him, bully-rook.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SHAL.</speaker>
<line>Sir, there is a fray to be fought between Sir Hugh the Welsh priest and Caius the French doctor.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FORD.</speaker>
<line>Good mine host o&#8217; th&#8217; Garter, a word with you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HOST.</speaker>
<line>What say&#8217;st thou, my bully-rook?</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Ford and the Host talks.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>SHAL.</speaker>
<stagedir>To Page.</stagedir>
<line>Will you go with us to behold it? My merry host hath had the measuring of their weapons, and, I think, hath appointed them contrary places; for, believe me, I hear the parson is no jester. Hark, I will tell you what our sport shall be.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>They converse apart.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>HOST.</speaker>
<line>Hast thou no suit against my knight, my guest-cavalier?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FORD.</speaker>
<line>None, I protest; but I&#8217;ll give you a pottle of burnt sack to give me recourse to him and tell him my name is Brook&#8212;only for a jest.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HOST.</speaker>
<line>My hand, bully; thou shalt have egress and regress&#8212;said I well?&#8212;and thy name shall be Brook. It is a merry knight. Will you go, An-heires?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SHAL.</speaker>
<line>Have with you, mine host.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAGE.</speaker>
<line>I have heard the Frenchman hath good skill in his rapier.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SHAL.</speaker>
<line>Tut, sir; I could have told you more. In these times you stand on distance: your passes, stoccadoes, and I know not what. &#8217;Tis the heart, Master Page, &#8217;tis here, &#8217;tis here. I have seen the time, with my long sword I would have made you four tall fellows skip like rats.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>HOST.</speaker>
<line>Here, boys, here, here! Shall we wag?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAGE.</speaker>
<line>Have with you. I had rather hear them scold than fight.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exeunt Host, Shallow, and Page.</stagedir>

<speech>

<line>Though Page be a secure fool, and stands so firmly on his wife&#8217;s frailty, yet I cannot put off my opinion so easily. She was in his company at Page&#8217;s house; and what they made there, I know not. Well, I will look further into&#8217;t, and I have a disguise to sound Falstaff. If I find her honest, I lose not my labor; if she be otherwise, &#8217;tis labor well bestow&#8217;d.</line>

<line>Why then the world&#8217;s mine oyster,</line>
<line>Which I with sword will open.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FAL.</speaker>
<line>Not a penny. I have been content, sir, you should lay my countenance to pawn. I have grated upon my good friends for three reprieves for you and your coach-fellow Nym; or else you had look&#8217;d through the grate, like a geminy of baboons. I am damn&#8217;d in hell for swearing to gentlemen my friends, you were good soldiers and tall fellows; and when Mistress Bridget lost the handle of her fan, I took&#8217;t upon mine honor thou hadst it not.</line>

<line>Didst not thou share? Hadst thou not fifteen pence?</line>

<speech>
<speaker>FAL.</speaker>
<line>Reason, you rogue, reason; think&#8217;st thou I&#8217;ll endanger my soul gratis? At a word, hang no more about me, I am no gibbet for you. Go&#8212;a short knife and a throng!&#8212;to your manor of Pickt-hatch! Go. You&#8217;ll not bear a letter for me, you rogue? You stand upon your honor! Why, thou unconfinable baseness, it is as much as I can do to keep the terms of my honor precise. I, I, I myself sometimes, leaving the fear of God on the left hand, and hiding mine honor in my necessity, am fain to shuffle, to hedge, and to lurch; and yet you, rogue, will ensconce your rags, your cat-a-mountain looks, your red-lattice phrases, and your bold-beating oaths, under the shelter of your honor! You will not do it? You!</line>

<line>Good maid then.</line>
</speech>

<speech>

<line>I&#8217;ll be sworn,</line>

<line>There is one Mistress Ford, sir&#8212;I pray come a little nearer this ways. I myself dwell with Master Doctor Caius&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FAL.</speaker>
<line>Well, on. Mistress Ford, you say&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>QUICK.</speaker>
<line>Your worship says very true. I pray your worship come a little nearer this ways.</line>

<speaker>FAL.</speaker>
<line>Well; Mistress Ford, what of her?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>QUICK.</speaker>
<line>Why, sir, she&#8217;s a good creature. Lord, Lord, your worship&#8217;s a wanton! Well&#8212;heaven forgive you, and all of us, I pray&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FAL.</speaker>
<line>Mistress Ford; come, Mistress Ford&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>QUICK.</speaker>
<line>Marry, this is the short and the long of it: you have brought her into such a canaries as &#8217;tis wonderful. The best courtier of them all (when the court lay at Windsor) could never have brought her to such a canary; yet there has been knights, and lords, and gentlemen, with their coaches; I warrant you, coach after coach, letter after letter, gift after gift; smelling so sweetly, all musk, and so rushling, I warrant you, in silk and gold, and in such alligant terms, and in such wine and sugar of the best, and the fairest, that would have won any woman&#8217;s heart; and I warrant you, they could never get an eye-wink of her. I had myself twenty angels given me this morning, but I defy all angels (in any such sort, as they say) but in the way of honesty; and I warrant you, they could never get her so much as sip on a cup with the proudest of them all, and yet there has been earls, nay (which is more) pensioners, but I warrant you all is one with her.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FAL.</speaker>
<line>But what says she to me? Be brief, my good she-Mercury.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>QUICK.</speaker>
<line>Marry, she hath receiv&#8217;d your letter&#8212;for the which she thanks you a thousand times&#8212;and she gives you to notify that her husband will be absence from his house between ten and eleven.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FAL.</speaker>
<line>Ten and eleven?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>QUICK.</speaker>
<line>Ay, forsooth; and then you may come and see the picture, she says, that you wot of. Master Ford her husband will be from home. Alas, the sweet woman leads an ill life with him. He&#8217;s a very jealousy man. She leads a very frampold life with him, good heart.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FAL.</speaker>
<line>Ten and eleven. Woman, commend me to her, I will not fail her.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>QUICK.</speaker>
<line>Why, you say well. But I have another messenger to your worship. Mistress Page hath her hearty commendations to you too; and let me tell you in your ear, she&#8217;s as fartuous a civil modest wife, and one (I tell you) that will not miss you morning nor evening prayer, as any is in Windsor, whoe&#8217;er be the other; and she bade me tell your worship that her husband is seldom from home, but she hopes there will come a time. I never knew a woman so dote upon a man; surely I think you have charms, la; yes, in truth.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FAL.</speaker>
<line>Not I, I assure thee. Setting the attraction of my good parts aside, I have no other charms.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>QUICK.</speaker>
<line>Blessing on your heart for&#8217;t!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FAL.</speaker>
<line>But I pray thee tell me this: has Ford&#8217;s wife and Page&#8217;s wife acquainted each other how they love me?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>QUICK.</speaker>
<line>That were a jest indeed! They have not so little grace, I hope. That were a trick indeed! But Mistress Page would desire you to send her your little page, of all loves. Her husband has a marvellous infection to the little page; and truly Master Page is an honest man. Never a wife in Windsor leads a better life than she does: do what she will, say what she will, take all, pay all, go to bed when she list, rise when she list, all is as she will; and truly she deserves it, for if there be a kind woman in Windsor, she is one. You must send her your page, no remedy.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FAL.</speaker>
<line>Why, I will.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>QUICK.</speaker>
<line>Nay, but do so then, and look you, he may come and go between you both; and in any case have a nay-word, that you may know one another&#8217;s mind, and the boy never need to understand any thing; for &#8217;tis not good that children should know any wickedness. Old folks, you know, have discretion, as they say, and know the world.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FAL.</speaker>
<line>Fare thee well, commend me to them both. There&#8217;s my purse, I am yet thy debtor. Boy, go along with this woman.</line>
<stagedir>Exeunt Mrs. Quickly and Robin.</stagedir>

<line>Say&#8217;st thou so, old Jack? Go thy ways. I&#8217;ll make more of thy old body than I have done. Will they yet look after thee? Wilt thou, after the expense of so much money, be now a gainer? Good body, I thank thee. Let them say &#8217;tis grossly done, so it be fairly done, no matter.</line>

<stagedir>Enter Bardolph.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>BARD.</speaker>
<line>Sir John, there&#8217;s one Master Brook below would fain speak with you, and be acquainted with you; and hath sent your worship a morning&#8217;s draught of sack.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>FAL.</speaker>
<line>Brook is his name?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BARD.</speaker>
<line>Ay, sir.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>FORD.</speaker>
<line>God save you, sir!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FAL.</speaker>
<line>And you, sir! Would you speak with me?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FORD.</speaker>
<line>I make bold, to press with so little preparation upon you.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>FAL.</speaker>
<line>You&#8217;re welcome. What&#8217;s your will? Give us leave, drawer.</line>

<line>Sir, I am a gentleman that have spent much. My name is Brook.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FAL.</speaker>
<line>Good Master Brook, I desire more acquaintance of you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FORD.</speaker>
<line>Good Sir John, I sue for yours&#8212;not to charge you, for I must let you understand I think myself in better plight for a lender than you are; the which hath something embold&#8217;ned me to this unseason&#8217;d intrusion; for they say, if money go before, all ways do lie open.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FAL.</speaker>
<line>Money is a good soldier, sir, and will on.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FORD.</speaker>
<line>Troth, and I have a bag of money here troubles me. If you will help to bear it, Sir John, take all, or half, for easing me of the carriage.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FAL.</speaker>
<line>Sir, I know not how I may deserve to be your porter.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FORD.</speaker>
<line>I will tell you, sir, if you will give me the hearing.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FAL.</speaker>
<line>Speak, good Master Brook, I shall be glad to be your servant.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FORD.</speaker>
<line>Sir, I hear you are a scholar (I will be brief with you), and you have been a man long known to me, though I had never so good means as desire to make myself acquainted with you. I shall discover a thing to you, wherein I must very much lay open mine own imperfection; but, good Sir John, as you have one eye upon my follies, as you hear them unfolded, turn another into the register of your own, that I may pass with a reproof the easier, sith you yourself know how easy it is to be such an offender.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FAL.</speaker>
<line>Very well, sir, proceed.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FORD.</speaker>
<line>There is a gentlewoman in this town, her husband&#8217;s name is Ford.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FAL.</speaker>
<line>Well, sir.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FORD.</speaker>
<line>I have long lov&#8217;d her, and I protest to you, bestow&#8217;d much on her; follow&#8217;d her with a doting observance; engross&#8217;d opportunities to meet her; fee&#8217;d every slight occasion that could but niggardly give me sight of her; not only bought many presents to give her, but have given largely to many to know what she would have given; briefly, I have pursu&#8217;d her as love hath pursu&#8217;d me, which hath been on the wing of all occasions. But whatsoever I have merited, either in my mind or in my means, meed I am sure I have receiv&#8217;d none, unless experience be a jewel&#8212;that I have purchas&#8217;d at an infinite rate, and that hath taught me to say this:</line>
<line><RECITE>&#8220;Love like a shadow flies when substance love pursues,</RECITE></line>
<line><RECITE>Pursuing that that flies, and flying what pursues.&#8221;</RECITE></line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FAL.</speaker>
<line>Have you receiv&#8217;d no promise of satisfaction at her hands?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FORD.</speaker>
<line>Never.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FAL.</speaker>
<line>Have you importun&#8217;d her to such a purpose?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FORD.</speaker>
<line>Never.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FAL.</speaker>
<line>Of what quality was your love then?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FORD.</speaker>
<line>Like a fair house built on another man&#8217;s ground, so that I have lost my edifice by mistaking the place where I erected it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FAL.</speaker>
<line>To what purpose have you unfolded this to me?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FORD.</speaker>
<line>When I have told you that, I have told you all. Some say that, though she appear honest to me, yet in other places she enlargeth her mirth so far that there is shrewd construction made of her. Now, Sir John, here is the heart of my purpose: you are a gentleman of excellent breeding, admirable discourse, of great admittance, authentic in your place and person, generally allow&#8217;d for your many war-like, court-like, and learned preparations.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FAL.</speaker>
<line>O sir!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FORD.</speaker>
<line>Believe it, for you know it. There is money, spend it, spend it; spend more; spend all I have; only give me so much of your time in exchange of it, as to lay an amiable siege to the honesty of this Ford&#8217;s wife. Use your art of wooing; win her to consent to you; if any man may, you may as soon as any.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FAL.</speaker>
<line>Would it apply well to the vehemency of your affection, that I should win what you would enjoy? Methinks you prescribe to yourself very preposterously.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FORD.</speaker>
<line>O, understand my drift. She dwells so securely on the excellency of her honor, that the folly of my soul dares not present itself; she is too bright to be look&#8217;d against. Now, could I come to her with any detection in my hand, my desires had instance and argument to commend themselves. I could drive her then from the ward of her purity, her reputation, her marriage vow, and a thousand other her defenses, which now are too too strongly embattled against me. What say you to&#8217;t, Sir John?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FAL.</speaker>
<line>Master Brook, I will first make bold with your money; next, give me your hand; and last, as I am a gentleman, you shall, and you will, enjoy Ford&#8217;s wife.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FORD.</speaker>
<line>O good sir!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FAL.</speaker>
<line>I say you shall.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FORD.</speaker>
<line>Want no money, Sir John, you shall want none.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FAL.</speaker>
<line>Want no Mistress Ford, Master Brook, you shall want none. I shall be with her (I may tell you) by her own appointment; even as you came in to me, her assistant or go-between parted from me. I say I shall be with her between ten and eleven; for at that time the jealous rascally knave her husband will be forth. Come you to me at night, you shall know how I speed.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FORD.</speaker>
<line>I am blest in your acquaintance. Do you know Ford, sir?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FAL.</speaker>
<line>Hang him, poor cuckoldly knave, I know him not. Yet I wrong him to call him poor. They say the jealous wittolly knave hath masses of money, for the which his wife seems to me well-favor&#8217;d. I will use her as the key of the cuckoldly rogue&#8217;s coffer, and there&#8217;s my harvest-home.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FORD.</speaker>
<line>I would you knew Ford, sir, that you might avoid him if you saw him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FAL.</speaker>
<line>Hang him, mechanical salt-butter rogue! I will stare him out of his wits; I will awe him with my cudgel; it shall hang like a meteor o&#8217;er the cuckold&#8217;s horns. Master Brook, thou shalt know I will predominate over the peasant, and thou shalt lie with his wife. Come to me soon at night. Ford&#8217;s a knave, and I will aggravate his style; thou, Master Brook, shalt know him for knave, and cuckold. Come to me soon at night.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>FORD.</speaker>
<line>What a damn&#8217;d Epicurean rascal is this! My heart is ready to crack with impatience. Who says this is improvident jealousy? My wife hath sent to him, the hour is fix&#8217;d, the match is made. Would any man have thought this? See the hell of having a false woman! My bed shall be abus&#8217;d, my coffers ransack&#8217;d, my reputation gnawn at, and I shall not only receive this villainous wrong, but stand under the adoption of abominable terms, and by him that does me this wrong. Terms! Names! Amaimon sounds well; Lucifer, well; Barbason, well; yet they are devils&#8217; additions, the names of fiends; but Cuckold! Wittol!&#8212;Cuckold! The devil himself hath not such a name. Page is an ass, a secure ass; he will trust his wife, he will not be jealous. I will rather trust a Fleming with my butter, Parson Hugh the Welshman with my cheese, an Irishman with my aqua-vitae bottle, or a thief to walk my ambling gelding, than my wife with herself. Then she plots, then she ruminates, then she devises; and what they think in their hearts they may effect, they will break their hearts but they will effect. God be prais&#8217;d for my jealousy! Eleven o&#8217; clock the hour. I will prevent this, detect my wife, be reveng&#8217;d on Falstaff, and laugh at Page. I will about it; better three hours too soon than a minute too late. Fie, fie, fie! Cuckold, cuckold, cuckold!</line>

Boys of art, I have deceiv&#8217;d you both; I have directed you to wrong places. Your hearts are mighty, your skins are whole, and let burnt sack be the issue. Come, lay their swords to pawn.

<line>Truly, sir, to see your wife. Is she at home?</line>

<stagedir>Exeunt Mrs. Page and Robin.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>FORD.</speaker>
<line>Has Page any brains? Hath he any eyes? Hath he any thinking? Sure they sleep, he hath no use of them. Why, this boy will carry a letter twenty mile, as easy as a cannon will shoot point-blank twelve score. He pieces out his wive&#8217;s inclination; he gives her folly motion and advantage; and now she&#8217;s going to my wife, and Falstaff&#8217;s boy with her. A man may hear this show&#8217;r sing in the wind. And Falstaff&#8217;s boy with her! Good plots, they are laid, and our revolted wives share damnation together. Well, I will take him, then torture my wife, pluck the borrow&#8217;d veil of modesty from the so-seeming Mistress Page, divulge Page himself for a secure and willful Actaeon; and to these violent proceedings all my neighbors shall cry aim.</line>
<stagedir>Clock heard.</stagedir>
<line>The clock gives me my cue, and my assurance bids me search&#8212;there I shall find Falstaff. I shall be rather prais&#8217;d for this than mock&#8217;d; for it is as positive as the earth is firm that Falstaff is there. I will go.</line>

<speaker>PAGE.</speaker>
<line>Not by my consent, I promise you. The gentleman is of no having. He kept company with the wild Prince and Poins; he is of too high a region, he knows too much. No, he shall not knit a knot in his fortunes with the finger of my substance. If he take her, let him take her simply. The wealth I have waits on my consent, and my consent goes not that way.</line>

<line>O well-a-day, Mistress Ford, having an honest man to your husband, to give him such cause of suspicion!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MRS. FORD.</speaker>
<line>What cause of suspicion?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MRS. PAGE.</speaker>
<line>What cause of suspicion? Out upon you! How am I mistook in you!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MRS. FORD.</speaker>
<line>Why, alas, what&#8217;s the matter?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MRS. PAGE.</speaker>
<line>Your husband&#8217;s coming hither, woman, with all the officers in Windsor, to search for a gentleman that he says is here now in the house; by your consent to take an ill advantage of his absence. You are undone.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MRS. FORD.</speaker>
<line>&#8217;Tis not so, I hope.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MRS. PAGE.</speaker>
<line>Pray heaven it be not so, that you have such a man here; but &#8217;tis most certain your husband&#8217;s coming, with half Windsor at his heels, to search for such a one. I come before to tell you. If you know yourself clear, why, I am glad of it; but if you have a friend here, convey, convey him out. Be not amaz&#8217;d, call all your senses to you, defend your reputation, or bid farewell to your good life forever.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MRS. FORD.</speaker>
<line>What shall I do? There is a gentleman, my dear friend; and I fear not mine own shame so much as his peril. I had rather than a thousand pound he were out of the house.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MRS. PAGE.</speaker>
<line>For shame, never stand &#8220;you had rather&#8221; and &#8220;you had rather.&#8221; Your husband&#8217;s here at hand, bethink you of some conveyance. In the house you cannot hide him. O, how have you deceiv&#8217;d me! Look, here is a basket; if he be of any reasonable stature, he may creep in here, and throw foul linen upon him, as if it were going to bucking; or&#8212;it is whiting-time&#8212;send him by your two men to Datchet-mead.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MRS. FORD.</speaker>
<line>He&#8217;s too big to go in there. What shall I do?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FAL.</speaker>
<stagedir>Starting from his concealment.</stagedir>
<line>Let me see&#8217;t, let me see&#8217;t, O, let me see&#8217;t! I&#8217;ll in, I&#8217;ll in. Follow your friend&#8217;s counsel. I&#8217;ll in.</line>

<line>What, Sir John Falstaff?</line>
<stagedir>Aside.</stagedir>
<line>Are these your letters, knight?</line>

<stagedir>Goes into the basket; they put clothes over him.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>MRS. PAGE.</speaker>
<line>Help to cover your master, boy. Call your men, Mistress Ford. You dissembling knight!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MRS. FORD.</speaker>
<line>What, John! Robert! John!</line>

<stagedir>Exit Robin.</stagedir>

<stagedir>Enter Servants.</stagedir>

<line>Go take up these clothes here quickly. Where&#8217;s the cowl-staff? Look how you drumble! Carry them to the laundress in Datchet-mead; quickly, come.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Ford, Page, Caius, Evans.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>FORD.</speaker>
<line>Pray you come near. If I suspect without cause, why then make sport at me, then let me be your jest, I deserve it. How now? Whither bear you this?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>1. SERV.</speaker>
<line>To the laundress, forsooth.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MRS. FORD.</speaker>
<line>Why, what have you to do whither they bear it? You were best meddle with buck-washing.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FORD.</speaker>
<line>Buck! I would I could wash myself of the buck! Buck, buck, buck! Ay, buck! I warrant you, buck, and of the season too, it shall appear.</line>
<stagedir>Exeunt Servants with the basket.</stagedir>
<line>Gentlemen, I have dream&#8217;d tonight; I&#8217;ll tell you my dream. Here, here, here be my keys. Ascend my chambers, search, seek, find out. I&#8217;ll warrant we&#8217;ll unkennel the fox. Let me stop this way first.</line>
<stagedir>Locking the door.</stagedir>
<line>So, now uncape.</line>

<speaker>PAGE.</speaker>
<line>Good Master Ford, be contented. You wrong yourself too much.</line>

<line>Is there not a double excellency in this?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MRS. FORD.</speaker>
<line>I know not which pleases me better, that my husband is deceiv&#8217;d, or Sir John.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MRS. PAGE.</speaker>
<line>What a taking was he in when your husband ask&#8217;d who was in the basket!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MRS. FORD.</speaker>
<line>I am half afraid he will have need of washing, so throwing him into the water will do him a benefit.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MRS. PAGE.</speaker>
<line>Hang him, dishonest rascal! I would all of the same strain were in the same distress.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MRS. FORD.</speaker>
<line>I think my husband hath some special suspicion of Falstaff&#8217;s being here, for I never saw him so gross in his jealousy till now.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MRS. PAGE.</speaker>
<line>I will lay a plot to try that, and we will yet have more tricks with Falstaff. His dissolute disease will scarce obey this medicine.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MRS. FORD.</speaker>
<line>Shall we send that foolish carrion, Mistress Quickly, to him, and excuse his throwing into the water, and give him another hope, to betray him to another punishment?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MRS. PAGE.</speaker>
<line>We will do it. Let him be sent for tomorrow, eight a&#8217; clock, to have amends.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Ford, Page, Caius, and Evans.</stagedir>

<line>Fie, fie, Master Ford, are you not asham&#8217;d? What spirit, what devil suggests this imagination? I would not ha&#8217; your distemper in this kind for the wealth of Windsor Castle.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>FORD.</speaker>
<line>&#8217;Tis my fault, Master Page. I suffer for it.</line>
</speech>

<line>You suffer for a pad conscience. Your wife is as honest a omans as I will desires among five thousand, and five hundred too.</line>

<line>Well, I promis&#8217;d you a dinner. Come, come, walk in the park. I pray you pardon me; I will hereafter make known to you why I have done this. Come, wife, come, Mistress Page, I pray you pardon me; pray heartly pardon me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAGE.</speaker>
<line>Let&#8217;s go in, gentlemen, but (trust me) we&#8217;ll mock him. I do invite you tomorrow morning to my house to breakfast; after, we&#8217;ll a-birding together. I have a fine hawk for the bush. Shall it be so?</line>

<line>No, Master Brook, but the peaking cornuto her husband, Master Brook, dwelling in a continual &#8217;larum of jealousy, comes me in the instant of our encounter, after we had embrac&#8217;d, kiss&#8217;d, protested, and, as it were, spoke the prologue of our comedy; and at his heels a rabble of his companions, thither provok&#8217;d and instigated by his distemper, and, forsooth, to search his house for his wive&#8217;s love.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FORD.</speaker>
<line>What? While you were there?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FAL.</speaker>
<line>While I was there.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FORD.</speaker>
<line>And did he search for you, and could not find you?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FAL.</speaker>
<line>You shall hear. As good luck would have it, comes in one Mistress Page; gives intelligence of Ford&#8217;s approach; and in her invention, and Ford&#8217;s wive&#8217;s distraction, they convey&#8217;d me into a buck-basket.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FORD.</speaker>
<line>A buck-basket?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FAL.</speaker>
<line>By the Lord, a buck-basket! Ramm&#8217;d me in with foul shirts and smocks, socks, foul stockings, greasy napkins, that, Master Brook, there was the rankest compound of villainous smell that ever offended nostril.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FORD.</speaker>
<line>And how long lay you there?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FAL.</speaker>
<line>Nay, you shall hear, Master Brook, what I have suffer&#8217;d to bring this woman to evil for your good. Being thus cramm&#8217;d in the basket, a couple of Ford&#8217;s knaves, his hinds, were call&#8217;d forth by their mistress to carry me in the name of foul clothes to Datchet-lane. They took me on their shoulders; met the jealous knave their master in the door, who ask&#8217;d them once or twice what they had in their basket. I quak&#8217;d for fear, lest the lunatic knave would have search&#8217;d it; but fate (ordaining he should be a cuckold) held his hand. Well, on went he for a search, and away went I for foul clothes. But mark the sequel, Master Brook. I suffer&#8217;d the pangs of three several deaths: first, an intolerable fright, to be detected with a jealious rotten bell-wether; next, to be compass&#8217;d like a good bilbo in the circumference of a peck, hilt to point, heel to head; and then to be stopp&#8217;d in like a strong distillation with stinking clothes that fretted in their own grease. Think of that&#8212;a man of my kidney. Think of that&#8212;that am as subject to heat as butter; a man of continual dissolution and thaw. It was a miracle to scape suffocation. And in the height of this bath (when I was more than half stew&#8217;d in grease, like a Dutch dish) to be thrown into the Thames, and cool&#8217;d, glowing-hot, in that surge, like a horse-shoe; think of that&#8212;hissing-hot&#8212;think of that, Master Brook.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FORD.</speaker>
<line>In good sadness, sir, I am sorry that for my sake you have suffer&#8217;d all this. My suit then is desperate; You&#8217;ll undertake her no more?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FAL.</speaker>
<line>Master Brook, I will be thrown into Etna, as I have been into Thames, ere I will leave her thus. Her husband is this morning gone a-birding. I have receiv&#8217;d from her another ambassy of meeting. &#8217;Twixt eight and nine is the hour, Master Brook.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FORD.</speaker>
<line>&#8217;Tis past eight already, sir.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FAL.</speaker>
<line>Is it? I will then address me to my appointment. Come to me at your convenient leisure, and you shall know how I speed; and the conclusion shall be crown&#8217;d with your enjoying her. <french xml:lang="fr">Adieu</french>. You shall have her, Master Brook. Master Brook, you shall cuckold Ford.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exit.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>FORD.</speaker>
<line>Hum! Ha? Is this a vision? Is this a dream? Do I sleep? Master Ford, awake! Awake, Master Ford! There&#8217;s a hole made in your best coat, Master Ford. This &#8217;tis to be married! This &#8217;tis to have linen and buck-baskets! Well, I will proclaim myself what I am. I will now take the lecher; he is at my house. He cannot scape me; &#8217;tis impossible he should; he cannot creep into a halfpenny purse, nor into a pepper-box. But lest the devil that guides him should aid him, I will search impossible places. Though what I am I cannot avoid, yet to be what I would not shall not make me tame. If I have horns to make one mad, let the proverb go with me: I&#8217;ll be horn-mad.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>MRS. PAGE.</speaker>
<line>Why, woman, your husband is in his old lines again. He so takes on yonder with my husband; so rails against all married mankind; so curses all Eve&#8217;s daughters, of what complexion soever; and so buffets himself on the forehead, crying, &#8220;Peer out, peer out!&#8221; , that any madness I ever yet beheld seem&#8217;d but tameness, civility, and patience to this his distemper he is in now. I am glad the fat knight is not here.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MRS. FORD.</speaker>
<line>Why, does he talk of him?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MRS. PAGE.</speaker>
<line>Of none but him, and swears he was carried out, the last time he search&#8217;d for him, in a basket; protests to my husband he is now here, and hath drawn him and the rest of their company from their sport, to make another experiment of his suspicion. But I am glad the knight is not here. Now he shall see his own foolery.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MRS. FORD.</speaker>
<line>How near is he, Mistress Page?</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MRS. PAGE.</speaker>
<line>Why then you are utterly sham&#8217;d, and he&#8217;s but a dead man. What a woman are you? Away with him, away with him! Better shame than murder.</line>
</speech>

<line>The spirit of wantonness is sure scar&#8217;d out of him. If the devil have him not in fee-simple, with fine and recovery, he will never, I think, in the way of waste, attempt us again.</line>

<line>You say he has been thrown in the rivers, and has been grievously peaten as an old oman. Methinks there should be terrors in him that he should not come; methinks his flesh is punish&#8217;d, he shall have no desires.</line>

<line>There is an old tale goes, that Herne the Hunter</line>
<line>(Sometime a keeper here in Windsor forest)</line>
<line>Doth all the winter-time, at still midnight,</line>
<line>Walk round about an oak, with great ragg&#8217;d horns,</line>
<line>And there he blasts the tree, and takes the cattle,</line>
<line>And makes milch-kine yield blood, and shakes a chain</line>
<line>In a most hideous and dreadful manner.</line>
<line>You have heard of such a spirit, and well you know</line>
<line>The superstitious idle-headed eld</line>
<line>Receiv&#8217;d and did deliver to our age</line>
<line>This tale of Herne the Hunter for a truth.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAGE.</speaker>
<line>Why, yet there want not many that do fear</line>
<line>In deep of night to walk by this Herne&#8217;s oak.</line>
<line>But what of this?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MRS. FORD.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Marry, this is our device:</line>
<line>That Falstaff at that oak shall meet with us,</line>
<line>Disguis&#8217;d like Herne, with huge horns on his head.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAGE.</speaker>
<line>Well, let it not be doubted but he&#8217;ll come,</line>
<line>And in this shape when you have brought him thither,</line>
<line>What shall be done with him? What is your plot?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MRS. PAGE.</speaker>
<line>That likewise have we thought upon, and thus:</line>
<line>Nan Page (my daughter) and my little son,</line>
<line>And three or four more of their growth, we&#8217;ll dress</line>
<line>Like urchins, ouphes, and fairies, green and white,</line>
<line>With rounds of waxen tapers on their heads,</line>
<line>And rattles in their hands. Upon a sudden,</line>
<line>As Falstaff, she, and I are newly met,</line>
<line>Let them from forth a sawpit rush at once</line>
<line>With some diffused song. Upon their sight,</line>
<line>We two in great amazedness will fly;</line>
<line>Then let them all encircle him about,</line>
<line>And fairy-like to pinch the unclean knight;</line>
<line>And ask him why, that hour of fairy revel,</line>
<line>In their so sacred paths he dares to tread</line>
<line>In shape profane.</line>

I warrant they would whip me with their fine wits till I were as crestfall&#8217;n as a dried pear. I never prosper&#8217;d since I forswore myself at primero.

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FAL.</speaker>
<line>What tellest thou me of black and blue? I was beaten myself into all the colors of the rainbow; and I was like to be apprehended for the witch of Brainford. But that my admirable dexterity of wit, my counterfeiting the action of an old woman, deliver&#8217;d me, the knave constable had set me i&#8217; th&#8217; stocks, i&#8217; th&#8217; common stocks, for a witch.</line>

<line>Sir&#8212;let me speak with you in your chamber. You shall hear how things go, and, I warrant, to your content. Here is a letter will say somewhat. Good hearts, what ado here is to bring you together! Sure, one of you does not serve heaven well, that you are so cross&#8217;d.</line>

<line>From time to time I have acquainted you</line>

<line>Of such contents as you will wonder at;</line>
<line>The mirth whereof so larded with my matter,</line>
<line>That neither, singly, can be manifested</line>
<line>Without the show of both. Fat Falstaff</line>
<line>Hath a great scene; the image of the jest</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll show you here at large. Hark, good mine host:</line>
<line>Tonight at Herne&#8217;s oak, just &#8217;twixt twelve and one,</line>
<line>Must my sweet Nan present the Fairy Queen;</line>
<line>The purpose why, is here; in which disguise,</line>
<line>While other jests are something rank on foot,</line>
<line>Her father hath commanded her to slip</line>
<line>Away with Slender, and with him at Eton</line>
<line>Immediately to marry. She hath consented.</line>
<line>Now, sir,</line>
<line>Her mother (even strong against that match</line>
<line>And firm for Doctor Caius) hath appointed</line>
<line>That he shall likewise shuffle her away,</line>
<line>While other sports are tasking of their minds,</line>
<line>And at the dean&#8217;ry, where a priest attends,</line>
<line>Straight marry her. To this her mother&#8217;s plot</line>
<line>She (seemingly obedient) likewise hath</line>
<line>Made promise to the doctor. Now, thus it rests:</line>
<line>Her father means she shall be all in white;</line>
<line>And in that habit, when Slender sees his time</line>
<line>To take her by the hand and bid her go,</line>
<line>She shall go with him. Her mother hath intended</line>
<line>(The better to denote her to the doctor,</line>
<line>For they must all be mask&#8217;d and vizarded)</line>
<line>That quaint in green she shall be loose enrob&#8217;d,</line>
<line>With ribands pendant, flaring &#8217;bout her head;</line>
<line>And when the doctor spies his vantage ripe,</line>
<line>To pinch her by the hand, and on that token,</line>
<line>The maid hath given consent to go with him.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>HOST.</speaker>
<line>Which means she to deceive, father or mother?</line>

<line>Both, my good host, to go along with me.</line>

<line>To stay for me at church, &#8217;twixt twelve and one,</line>
<line>And in the lawful name of marrying,</line>
<line>To give our hearts united ceremony.</line>

<line>I went to her, Master Brook, as you see, like a poor old man, but I came from her, Master Brook, like a poor old woman. That same knave Ford, her husband, hath the finest mad devil of jealousy in him, Master Brook, that ever govern&#8217;d frenzy. I will tell you&#8212;he beat me grievously, in the shape of a woman; for in the shape of man, Master Brook, I fear not Goliah with a weaver&#8217;s beam, because I know also life is a shuttle. I am in haste, go along with me, I&#8217;ll tell you all, Master Brook. Since I pluck&#8217;d geese, play&#8217;d truant, and whipt top, I knew not what &#8217;twas to be beaten till lately. Follow me, I&#8217;ll tell you strange things of this knave Ford, on whom tonight I will be reveng&#8217;d, and I will deliver his wife into your hand. Follow. Strange things in hand, Master Brook!

<line>The Windsor bell hath strook twelve; the minute draws on. Now the hot-bloodied gods assist me! Remember, Jove, thou wast a bull for thy Europa, love set on thy horns. O powerful love, that in some respects makes a beast a man; in some other, a man a beast. You were also, Jupiter, a swan for the love of Leda. O omnipotent love, how near the god drew to the complexion of a goose! A fault done first in the form of a beast (O Jove, a beastly fault!) and then another fault in the semblance of a fowl&#8212;think on&#8217;t, Jove, a foul fault! When gods have hot backs, what shall poor men do? For me, I am here a Windsor stag, and the fattest, I think, i&#8217; th&#8217; forest.

<stagedir>The Song</stagedir>
<line type="lyric">Fie on sinful fantasy!</line>

<stagedir>Here they pinch him and sing about him.

His horses are arrested for it, Master Brook.</line>

<line>Sir John, we have had ill luck; we could never meet. I will never take you for my love again, but I will always count you my deer.</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FAL.</speaker>
<line>And these are not fairies? I was three or four times in the thought they were not fairies, and yet the guiltiness of my mind, the sudden surprise of my powers, drove the grossness of the foppery into a receiv&#8217;d belief, in despite of the teeth of all rhyme and reason, that they were fairies. See now how wit may be made a Jack-a-Lent, when &#8217;tis upon ill employment!</line>

</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FAL.</speaker>
<line>Have I laid my brain in the sun and dried it, that it wants matter to prevent so gross o&#8217;erreaching as this? Am I ridden with a Welsh goat too? Shall I have a coxcomb of frieze? &#8217;Tis time I were chok&#8217;d with a piece of toasted cheese.</line>

<line>&#8220;Seese&#8221; and &#8220;putter&#8221;! Have I liv&#8217;d to stand at the taunt of one that makes fritters of English? This is enough to be the decay of lust and late-walking through the realm.</line>

<line>Well, I am your theme. You have the start of me, I am dejected. I am not able to answer the Welsh flannel; ignorance itself is a plummet o&#8217;er me. Use me as you will.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>FORD.</speaker>
<line>Marry, sir, we&#8217;ll bring you to Windsor, to one Master Brook that you have cozen&#8217;d of money, to whom you should have been a pander. Over and above that you have suffer&#8217;d, I think to repay that money will be a biting affliction.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAGE.</speaker>
<line>Yet be cheerful, knight. Thou shalt eat a posset tonight at my house, where I will desire thee to laugh at my wife, that now laughs at thee. Tell her Master Slender hath married her daughter.</line>

<speaker>PAGE.</speaker>
<line>Of what, son?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SLEN.</speaker>
<line>I came yonder at Eton to marry Mistress Anne Page, and she&#8217;s a great lubberly boy. If it had not been i&#8217; th&#8217; church, I would have swing&#8217;d him, or he should have swing&#8217;d me. If I did not think it had been Anne Page, would I might never stir!&#8212;and &#8217;tis a postmaster&#8217;s boy.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>PAGE.</speaker>
<line>Upon my life then, you took the wrong.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SLEN.</speaker>
<line>When need you tell me that? I think so, when I took a boy for a girl. If I had been married to him (for all he was in woman&#8217;s apparel) I would not have had him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAGE.</speaker>
<line>Why, this is your own folly. Did not I tell you how you should know my daughter by her garments?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SLEN.</speaker>
<line>I went to her in white and cried &#8220;mum,&#8221; and she cried &#8220;budget,&#8221; as Anne and I had appointed, and yet it was not Anne, but a postmaster&#8217;s boy.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MRS. PAGE.</speaker>
<line>Good George, be not angry. I knew of your purpose; turn&#8217;d my daughter into green; and indeed she is now with the Doctor at the dean&#8217;ry, and there married.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>FENT.</speaker>
<line>You do amaze her. Hear the truth of it.</line>
<line>You would have married her most shamefully,</line>
<line>Where there was no proportion held in love.</line>
<line>The truth is, she and I (long since contracted)</line>
<line>Are now so sure that nothing can dissolve us.</line>
<line>Th&#8217; offense is holy that she hath committed,</line>
<line>And this deceit loses the name of craft,</line>
<line>Of disobedience, or unduteous title,</line>
<line>Since therein she doth evitate and shun</line>
<line>A thousand irreligious cursed hours</line>
<line>Which forced marriage would have brought upon her.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FORD.</speaker>
<line>Stand not amaz&#8217;d; here is no remedy.</line>
