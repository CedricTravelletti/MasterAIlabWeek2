<speaker>CHORUS.</speaker>
<line>Two households, both alike in dignity,</line>
<line>In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,</line>
<line>From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,</line>
<line>Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.</line>
<line>From forth the fatal loins of these two foes</line>
<line>A pair of star-cross&#8217;d lovers take their life;</line>
<line>Whose misadventur&#8217;d piteous overthrows</line>
<line>Doth with their death bury their parents&#8217; strife.</line>
<line>The fearful passage of their death-mark&#8217;d love,</line>
<line>And the continuance of their parents&#8217; rage,</line>
<line>Which, but their children&#8217;s end, nought could remove,</line>
<line>Is now the two hours&#8217; traffic of our stage;</line>
<line>The which if you with patient ears attend,</line>
<line>What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.</line>

<stagedir>Enter Sampson and Gregory, with swords and bucklers, of the house of Capulet.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>SAM.</speaker>
<line>Gregory, on my word, we&#8217;ll not carry coals.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GRE.</speaker>
<line>No, for then we should be colliers.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SAM.</speaker>
<line>I mean, and we be in choler, we&#8217;ll draw.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GRE.</speaker>
<line>Ay, while you live, draw your neck out of collar.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SAM.</speaker>
<line>I strike quickly, being mov&#8217;d.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GRE.</speaker>
<line>But thou art not quickly mov&#8217;d to strike.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SAM.</speaker>
<line>A dog of the house of Montague moves me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GRE.</speaker>
<line>To move is to stir, and to be valiant is to stand; therefore, if thou art mov&#8217;d, thou run&#8217;st away.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SAM.</speaker>
<line>A dog of that house shall move me to stand! I will take the wall of any man or maid of Montague&#8217;s.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GRE.</speaker>
<line>That shows thee a weak slave, for the weakest goes to the wall.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SAM.</speaker>
<line>&#8217;Tis true, and therefore women, being the weaker vessels, are ever thrust to the wall; therefore I will push Montague&#8217;s men from the wall, and thrust his maids to the wall.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GRE.</speaker>
<line>The quarrel is between our masters, and us their men.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SAM.</speaker>
<line>&#8217;Tis all one; I will show myself a tyrant: when I have fought with the men, I will be civil with the maids; I will cut off their heads.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GRE.</speaker>
<line>The heads of the maids?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SAM.</speaker>
<line>Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads, take it in what sense thou wilt.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GRE.</speaker>
<line>They must take it in sense that feel it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SAM.</speaker>
<line>Me they shall feel while I am able to stand, and &#8217;tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GRE.</speaker>
<line>&#8217;Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou hadst been poor-John. Draw thy tool, here comes two of the house of Montagues.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter two other servingmen: Abram and Balthasar.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>SAM.</speaker>
<line>My naked weapon is out. Quarrel, I will back thee.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GRE.</speaker>
<line>How, turn thy back and run?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SAM.</speaker>
<line>Fear me not.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GRE.</speaker>
<line>No, marry, I fear thee!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SAM.</speaker>
<line>Let us take the law of our sides, let them begin.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GRE.</speaker>
<line>I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as they list.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SAM.</speaker>
<line>Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them, which is disgrace to them if they bear it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ABR.</speaker>
<line>Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SAM.</speaker>
<line>I do bite my thumb, sir.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ABR.</speaker>
<line>Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?</line>

<speech>
<speaker>SAM.</speaker>
<stagedir>Aside to Gregory.</stagedir>
<line>Is the law of our side if I say ay?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GRE.</speaker>
<stagedir>Aside to Sampson.</stagedir>
<line>No.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SAM.</speaker>
<line>No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I bite my thumb, sir.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>GRE.</speaker>
<line>Do you quarrel, sir?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ABR.</speaker>
<line>Quarrel, sir? No, sir.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SAM.</speaker>
<line>But if you do, sir, I am for you. I serve as good a man as you.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ABR.</speaker>
<line>No better?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>SAM.</speaker>
<line>Well, sir.</line>

<stagedir>They fight.</stagedir>

<stagedir>Beats down their swords.</stagedir>

<stagedir>Enter Tybalt.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>TYB.</speaker>
<line>What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?</line>
<line>Turn thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BEN.</speaker>
<line>I do but keep the peace. Put up thy sword,</line>
<line>Or manage it to part these men with me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>TYB.</speaker>
<line>What, drawn and talk of peace? I hate the word</line>
<line>As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee.</line>
<line>Have at thee, coward!</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>They fight.</stagedir>

<stagedir>Enter three or four Citizens with clubs or partisans.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>CITIZENS.</speaker>
<line>Clubs, bills, and partisans! Strike! Beat them down!</line>
<line>Down with the Capulets! Down with the Montagues!</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter old Capulet in his gown, and his wife, Lady Capulet.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>CAP.</speaker>
<line>What noise is this? Give me my long sword ho!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LA. CAP.</speaker>
<line>A crutch, a crutch! Why call you for a sword?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CAP.</speaker>
<line>My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,</line>
<line>And flourishes his blade in spite of me.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter old Montague and his wife, Lady Montague.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>MON.</speaker>
<line>Thou villain Capulet!&#8212;Hold me not, let me go.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LA. MON.</speaker>
<line>Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Prince Escalus with his Train.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>PRIN.</speaker>
<line>Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,</line>
<line>Profaners of this neighbor-stained steel&#8212;</line>
<line>Will they not hear?&#8212;What ho, you men, you beasts!</line>
<line>That quench the fire of your pernicious rage</line>
<line>With purple fountains issuing from your veins&#8212;</line>
<line>On pain of torture, from those bloody hands</line>
<line>Throw your mistempered weapons to the ground,</line>
<line>And hear the sentence of your moved prince.</line>
<line>Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,</line>
<line>By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,</line>
<line>Have thrice disturb&#8217;d the quiet of our streets,</line>
<line>And made Verona&#8217;s ancient citizens</line>
<line>Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments</line>
<line>To wield old partisans, in hands as old,</line>
<line>Cank&#8217;red with peace, to part your cank&#8217;red hate;</line>
<line>If ever you disturb our streets again</line>
<line>Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.</line>
<line>For this time all the rest depart away.</line>
<line>You, Capulet, shall go along with me,</line>
<line>And, Montague, come you this afternoon,</line>
<line>To know our farther pleasure in this case,</line>
<line>To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.</line>
<line>Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exeunt all but Montague, Lady Montague, and Benvolio.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>MON.</speaker>
<line>Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?</line>
<line>Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BEN.</speaker>
<line>Here were the servants of your adversary,</line>
<line>And yours, close fighting ere I did approach.</line>
<line>I drew to part them. In the instant came</line>
<line>The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Which, as he breath&#8217;d defiance to my ears,</line>
<line>He swung about his head and cut the winds,</line>
<line>Who, nothing hurt withal, hiss&#8217;d him in scorn.</line>
<line>While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,</line>
<line>Came more and more, and fought on part and part,</line>
<line>Till the Prince came, who parted either part.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LA. MON.</speaker>
<line>O, where is Romeo? Saw you him today?</line>
<line>Right glad I am he was not at this fray.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BEN.</speaker>
<line>Madam, an hour before the worshipp&#8217;d sun</line>
<line>Peer&#8217;d forth the golden window of the east,</line>
<line>A troubled mind drive me to walk abroad,</line>
<line>Where, underneath the grove of sycamore</line>
<line>That westward rooteth from this city side,</line>
<line>So early walking did I see your son.</line>
<line>Towards him I made, but he was ware of me,</line>
<line>And stole into the covert of the wood.</line>
<line>I, measuring his affections by my own,</line>
<line>Which then most sought where most might not be found,</line>
<line>Being one too many by my weary self,</line>
<line>Pursued my humor not pursuing his,</line>
<line>And gladly shunn&#8217;d who gladly fled from me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MON.</speaker>
<line>Many a morning hath he there been seen,</line>
<line>With tears augmenting the fresh morning&#8217;s dew,</line>
<line>Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs,</line>
<line>But all so soon as the all-cheering sun</line>
<line>Should in the farthest east begin to draw</line>
<line>The shady curtains from Aurora&#8217;s bed,</line>
<line>Away from light steals home my heavy son,</line>
<line>And private in his chamber pens himself,</line>
<line>Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out,</line>
<line>And makes himself an artificial night.</line>
<line>Black and portendous must this humor prove,</line>
<line>Unless good counsel may the cause remove.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BEN.</speaker>
<line>My noble uncle, do you know the cause?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MON.</speaker>
<line>I neither know it, nor can learn of him.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BEN.</speaker>
<line>Have you importun&#8217;d him by any means?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MON.</speaker>
<line>Both by myself and many other friends,</line>
<line>But he, his own affections&#8217; counsellor,</line>
<line>Is to himself (I will not say how true)</line>
<line>But to himself so secret and so close,</line>
<line>So far from sounding and discovery,</line>
<line>As is the bud bit with an envious worm,</line>
<line>Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air</line>
<line>Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.</line>
<line>Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,</line>
<line>We would as willingly give cure as know.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Romeo.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>BEN.</speaker>
<line>See where he comes. So please you step aside,</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll know his grievance, or be much denied.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MON.</speaker>
<line>I would thou wert so happy by thy stay</line>
<line>To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let&#8217;s away.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Exeunt Montague and Lady.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>BEN.</speaker>
<line>Good morrow, cousin.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROM.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Is the day so young?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BEN.</speaker>
<line>But new strook nine.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROM.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Ay me, sad hours seem long.</line>
<line>Was that my father that went hence so fast?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BEN.</speaker>
<line>It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo&#8217;s hours?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROM.</speaker>
<line>Not having that which, having, makes them short.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BEN.</speaker>
<line>In love?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROM.</speaker>
<line>Out&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BEN.</speaker>
<line>Of love?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROM.</speaker>
<line>Out of her favor where I am in love.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BEN.</speaker>
<line>Alas that love, so gentle in his view,</line>
<line>Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROM.</speaker>
<line>Alas that love, whose view is muffled still,</line>
<line>Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!</line>
<line>Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?</line>
<line>Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all:</line>
<line>Here&#8217;s much to do with hate, but more with love.</line>
<line>Why then, O brawling love! O loving hate!</line>
<line>O any thing, of nothing first create!</line>
<line>O heavy lightness, serious vanity,</line>
<line>Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms,</line>
<line>Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health,</line>
<line>Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!</line>
<line>This love feel I, that feel no love in this.</line>
<line>Dost thou not laugh?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BEN.</speaker>
<line offset="4">No, coz, I rather weep.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROM.</speaker>
<line>Good heart, at what?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BEN.</speaker>
<line offset="4">At thy good heart&#8217;s oppression.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROM.</speaker>
<line>Why, such is love&#8217;s transgression.</line>
<line>Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,</line>
<line>Which thou wilt propagate to have it press&#8217;d</line>
<line>With more of thine. This love that thou hast shown</line>
<line>Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.</line>
<line>Love is a smoke made with the fume of sighs,</line>
<line>Being purg&#8217;d, a fire sparkling in lovers&#8217; eyes,</line>
<line>Being vex&#8217;d, a sea nourish&#8217;d with loving tears.</line>
<line>What is it else? A madness most discreet,</line>
<line>A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.</line>
<line>Farewell, my coz.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BEN.</speaker>
<line offset="4">Soft, I will go along;</line>
<line>And if you leave me so, you do me wrong.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROM.</speaker>
<line>Tut, I have lost myself, I am not here:</line>
<line>This is not Romeo, he&#8217;s some other where.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BEN.</speaker>
<line>Tell me in sadness, who is that you love?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROM.</speaker>
<line>What, shall I groan and tell thee?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BEN.</speaker>
<line offset="6">Groan? Why, no;</line>
<line>But sadly tell me, who?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROM.</speaker>
<line>Bid a sick man in sadness make his will&#8212;</line>
<line>A word ill urg&#8217;d to one that is so ill!</line>
<line>In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BEN.</speaker>
<line>I aim&#8217;d so near when I suppos&#8217;d you lov&#8217;d.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROM.</speaker>
<line>A right good mark-man! And she&#8217;s fair I love.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BEN.</speaker>
<line>A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROM.</speaker>
<line>Well, in that hit you miss: she&#8217;ll not be hit</line>
<line>With Cupid&#8217;s arrow, she hath Dian&#8217;s wit;</line>
<line>And in strong proof of chastity well arm&#8217;d,</line>
<line>From Love&#8217;s weak childish bow she lives uncharm&#8217;d.</line>
<line>She will not stay the siege of loving terms,</line>
<line>Nor bide th&#8217; encounter of assailing eyes,</line>
<line>Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold.</line>
<line>O, she is rich in beauty, only poor</line>
<line>That, when she dies, with beauty dies her store.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BEN.</speaker>
<line>Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROM.</speaker>
<line>She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste;</line>
<line>For beauty starv&#8217;d with her severity</line>
<line>Cuts beauty off from all posterity.</line>
<line>She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,</line>
<line>To merit bliss by making me despair.</line>
<line>She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow</line>
<line>Do I live dead that live to tell it now.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BEN.</speaker>
<line>Be rul&#8217;d by me, forget to think of her.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROM.</speaker>
<line>O, teach me how I should forget to think.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BEN.</speaker>
<line>By giving liberty unto thine eyes:</line>
<line>Examine other beauties.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROM.</speaker>
<line offset="5">&#8217;Tis the way</line>
<line>To call hers (exquisite) in question more.</line>
<line>These happy masks that kiss fair ladies&#8217; brows,</line>
<line>Being black, puts us in mind they hide the fair.</line>
<line>He that is strooken blind cannot forget</line>
<line>The precious treasure of his eyesight lost.</line>
<line>Show me a mistress that is passing fair,</line>
<line>What doth her beauty serve but as a note</line>
<line>Where I may read who pass&#8217;d that passing fair?</line>
<line>Farewell, thou canst not teach me to forget.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BEN.</speaker>
<line>I&#8217;ll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>CAP.</speaker>
<line>But Montague is bound as well as I,</line>
<line>In penalty alike, and &#8217;tis not hard, I think,</line>
<line>For men so old as we to keep the peace.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAR.</speaker>
<line>Of honorable reckoning are you both,</line>

<line>But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CAP.</speaker>
<line>But saying o&#8217;er what I have said before:</line>
<line>My child is yet a stranger in the world,</line>
<line>She hath not seen the change of fourteen years;</line>
<line>Let two more summers wither in their pride,</line>

<line>My will to her consent is but a part;</line>
<line>And she agreed, within her scope of choice</line>
<line>Lies my consent and fair according voice.</line>
<line>This night I hold an old accustom&#8217;d feast,</line>

<line>Which on more view of many, mine, being one,</line>

<speaker>2. SERV.</speaker>
<line>Find them out whose names are written here!

<line>On the forefinger of an alderman,</line>
<line>Drawn with a team of little atomi</line>
<line>Over men&#8217;s noses as they lie asleep.</line>
<line>Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut,</line>
<line>Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,</line>
<line>Time out a&#8217; mind the fairies&#8217; coachmakers.</line>
<line>Her waggon-spokes made of long spinners&#8217; legs,</line>
<line>The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,</line>
<line>Her traces of the smallest spider web,</line>
<line>Her collars of the moonshine&#8217;s wat&#8217;ry beams,</line>
<line>Her whip of cricket&#8217;s bone, the lash of film,</line>
<line>Her waggoner a small grey-coated gnat,</line>
<line>Not half so big as a round little worm</line>
<line>Prick&#8217;d from the lazy finger of a maid.</line>
<line>And in this state she gallops night by night</line>
<line>Through lovers&#8217; brains, and then they dream of love;</line>
<line>O&#8217;er courtiers&#8217; knees, that dream on cur&#8217;sies straight;</line>
<line>O&#8217;er lawyers&#8217; fingers, who straight dream on fees;</line>
<line>O&#8217;er ladies&#8217; lips, who straight on kisses dream,</line>
<line>Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,</line>
<line>Because their breath with sweetmeats tainted are.</line>
<line>Sometime she gallops o&#8217;er a courtier&#8217;s nose,</line>
<line>And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;</line>
<line>And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig&#8217;s tail</line>
<line>Tickling a parson&#8217;s nose as &#8217;a lies asleep,</line>
<line>Then he dreams of another benefice.</line>
<line>Sometime she driveth o&#8217;er a soldier&#8217;s neck,</line>
<line>And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,</line>
<line>Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,</line>
<line>Of healths five fathom deep; and then anon</line>
<line>Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,</line>
<line>And being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two,</line>
<line>And sleeps again. This is that very Mab</line>
<line>That plats the manes of horses in the night,</line>
<line>And bakes the elf-locks in foul sluttish hairs,</line>
<line>Which, once untangled, much misfortune bodes.</line>
<line>This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,</line>

<line>Such as would please; &#8217;tis gone, &#8217;tis gone, &#8217;tis gone.</line>
<line>You are welcome, gentlemen! Come, musicians, play.</line>

<stagedir>Music plays, and they dance.</stagedir>
<line>A hall, a hall! Give room! And foot it, girls.</line>
<line>More light, you knaves, and turn the tables up;</line>
<line>And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.</line>
<line>Ah, sirrah, this unlook&#8217;d-for sport comes well.</line>
<line>Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet,</line>
<line>For you and I are past our dancing days.</line>

<line>Come Pentecost as quickly as it will,</line>
<line>Some five and twenty years, and then we mask&#8217;d.</line>

<line>O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!</line>
<line>It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night</line>
<line>As a rich jewel in an Ethiop&#8217;s ear&#8212;</line>
<line>Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!</line>
<line>So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows,</line>
<line>As yonder lady o&#8217;er her fellows shows.</line>
<line>The measure done, I&#8217;ll watch her place of stand,</line>

<line>I would not for the wealth of all this town</line>

<line>It is my will, the which if thou respect,</line>

<line>Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,</line>

<line>He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not,</line>
<line>The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.</line>
<line>I conjure thee by Rosaline&#8217;s bright eyes,</line>
<line>By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,</line>

<line>Of some strange nature, letting it there stand</line>
<line>Till she had laid it and conjur&#8217;d it down.</line>

<line>I am too bold, &#8217;tis not to me she speaks.</line>
<line>Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,</line>
<line>Having some business, do entreat her eyes</line>
<line>To twinkle in their spheres till they return.</line>
<line>What if her eyes were there, they in her head?</line>
<line>The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,</line>

<line>Thou mayest prove false: at lovers&#8217; perjuries</line>
<line>They say Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,</line>
<line>If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully;</line>
<line>Or if thou thinkest I am too quickly won,</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll frown and be perverse, and say thee nay,</line>
<line>So thou wilt woo, but else not for the world.</line>
<line>In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,</line>

<line>The day to cheer and night&#8217;s dank dew to dry,</line>
<line>I must up-fill this osier cage of ours</line>
<line>With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.</line>
<line>The earth that&#8217;s nature&#8217;s mother is her tomb;</line>
<line>What is her burying grave, that is her womb;</line>
<line>And from her womb children of divers kind</line>
<line>We sucking on her natural bosom find:</line>
<line>Many for many virtues excellent,</line>
<line>None but for some, and yet all different.</line>
<line>O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies</line>
<line>In plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities;</line>
<line>For nought so vile that on the earth doth live</line>
<line>But to the earth some special good doth give;</line>
<line>Nor aught so good but, strain&#8217;d from that fair use,</line>

<line>Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine</line>

<line>The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,</line>
<line>Thy old groans yet ringing in mine ancient ears;</line>
<line>Lo here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit</line>
<line>Of an old tear that is not wash&#8217;d off yet.</line>
<line>If e&#8217;er thou wast thyself and these woes thine,</line>

<line>Where the dev&#8217;l should this Romeo be?</line>
<line>Came he not home tonight?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BEN.</speaker>
<line>Not to his father&#8217;s, I spoke with his man.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MER.</speaker>
<line>Why, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline,</line>
<line>Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BEN.</speaker>
<line>Tybalt, the kinsman to old Capulet,</line>
<line>Hath sent a letter to his father&#8217;s house.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MER.</speaker>
<line>A challenge, on my life.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>BEN.</speaker>
<line>Romeo will answer it.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>MER.</speaker>
<line>Any man that can write may answer a letter.</line>

<speaker>BEN.</speaker>
<line>Nay, he will answer the letter&#8217;s master, how he dares, being dar&#8217;d.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>MER.</speaker>
<line>Alas, poor Romeo, he is already dead, stabb&#8217;d with a white wench&#8217;s black eye, run through the ear with a love-song, the very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy&#8217;s butt-shaft; and is he a man to encounter Tybalt?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BEN.</speaker>
<line>Why, what is Tybalt?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MER.</speaker>
<line>More than Prince of Cats. O, he&#8217;s the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as you sing prick-song, keeps time, distance, and proportion; he rests his minim rests, one, two, and the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the very first house, of the first and second cause. Ah, the immortal passado, the punto reverso, the hay!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BEN.</speaker>
<line>The what?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MER.</speaker>
<line>The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting phantasimes, these new tuners of accent! &#8220;By Jesu, a very good blade! A very tall man! A very good whore!&#8221; Why, is not this a lamentable thing, grandsire, that we should be thus afflicted with these strange flies, these fashion-mongers, these pardon-me&#8217;s, who stand so much on the new form, that they cannot sit at ease on the old bench? O, their bones, their bones!</line>

<line>Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>MER.</speaker>
<line>Without his roe, like a dried herring: O flesh, flesh, how art thou fishified! Now is he for the numbers that Petrarch flow&#8217;d in. Laura to his lady was a kitchen wench (marry, she had a better love to berhyme her), Dido a dowdy, Cleopatra a gypsy, Helen and Hero hildings and harlots, Thisby a grey eye or so, but not to the purpose. Signior Romeo, <french xml:lang="fr">bon jour</french>! There&#8217;s a French salutation to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit fairly last night.</line>

<line>The slip, sir, the slip, can you not conceive?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROM.</speaker>
<line>Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great, and in such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MER.</speaker>
<line>That&#8217;s as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a man to bow in the hams.</line>

<line>Meaning to cur&#8217;sy.</line>

<line>Why then is my pump well flower&#8217;d.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MER.</speaker>
<line>Sure wit! Follow me this jest now, till thou hast worn out thy pump, that when the single sole of it is worn, the jest may remain, after the wearing, solely singular.</line>

<line>Nay, if our wits run the wild-goose chase, I am done; for thou hast more of the wild goose in one of thy wits than, I am sure, I have in my whole five. Was I with you there for the goose?</line>

<speaker>ROM.</speaker>
<line>Thou wast never with me for any thing when thou wast not there for the goose.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>ROM.</speaker>
<line>Nay, good goose, bite not.</line>

<line>O, here&#8217;s a wit of cheverel, that stretches from an inch narrow to an ell broad!</line>

<speech>
<speaker>ROM.</speaker>
<line>I stretch it out for that word &#8220;broad,&#8221; which, added to the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>MER.</speaker>
<line>Why, is not this better now than groaning for love? Now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature, for this drivelling love is like a great natural that runs lolling up and down to hide his bable in a hole.</line>

<line>Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.</line>
</speech>

<speech>

<stagedir>Exeunt Mercutio and Benvolio.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>NURSE.</speaker>
<line>I pray you, sir, what saucy merchant was this, that was so full of his ropery?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROM.</speaker>
<line>A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk, and will speak more in a minute than he will stand to in a month.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NURSE.</speaker>
<line>And &#8217;a speak any thing against me, I&#8217;ll take him down, and &#8217;a were lustier than he is, and twenty such Jacks; and if I cannot, I&#8217;ll find those that shall. Scurvy knave, I am none of his flirt-gills, I am none of his skains-mates.</line>
<stagedir>She turns to Peter, her man.</stagedir>
<line>And thou must stand by too and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PET.</speaker>
<line>I saw no man use you at his pleasure; if I had, my weapon should quickly have been out. I warrant you, I dare draw as soon as another man, if I see occasion in a good quarrel, and the law on my side.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NURSE.</speaker>
<line>Now, afore God, I am so vex&#8217;d that every part about me quivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word: and as I told you, my young lady bid me inquire you out; what she bid me say, I will keep to myself. But first let me tell ye, if ye should lead her in a fool&#8217;s paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind of behavior, as they say; for the gentlewoman is young; and therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were an ill thing to be off&#8217;red to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROM.</speaker>
<line>Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I protest unto thee&#8212;</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NURSE.</speaker>
<line>Good heart, and, i&#8217; faith, I will tell her as much. Lord, Lord, she will be a joyful woman.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROM.</speaker>
<line>What wilt thou tell her, nurse? Thou dost not mark me.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NURSE.</speaker>
<line>I will tell her, sir, that you do protest, which, as I take it, is a gentleman-like offer.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROM.</speaker>
<line>Bid her devise</line>
<line>Some means to come to shrift this afternoon,</line>
<line>And there she shall at Friar Lawrence&#8217; cell</line>
<line>Be shriv&#8217;d and married. Here is for thy pains.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NURSE.</speaker>
<line>No, truly, sir, not a penny.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROM.</speaker>
<line>Go to, I say you shall.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NURSE.</speaker>
<line>This afternoon, sir? Well, she shall be there.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROM.</speaker>
<line>And stay, good nurse&#8212;behind the abbey wall</line>
<line>Within this hour my man shall be with thee,</line>
<line>And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair,</line>
<line>Which to the high top-gallant of my joy</line>
<line>Must be my convoy in the secret night.</line>
<line>Farewell, be trusty, and I&#8217;ll quit thy pains.</line>
<line>Farewell, commend me to thy mistress.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NURSE.</speaker>
<line>Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROM.</speaker>
<line>What say&#8217;st thou, my dear nurse?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NURSE.</speaker>
<line>Is your man secret? Did you ne&#8217;er hear say,</line>
<line>&#8220;Two may keep counsel, putting one away&#8221;?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROM.</speaker>
<line>&#8217;Warrant thee, my man&#8217;s as true as steel.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NURSE.</speaker>
<line>Well, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady&#8212;Lord, Lord! When &#8217;twas a little prating thing&#8212;O, there is a nobleman in town, one Paris, that would fain lay knife aboard; but she, good soul, had as lieve see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her sometimes and tell her that Paris is the properer man, but I&#8217;ll warrant you, when I say so, she looks as pale as any clout in the versal world. Doth not rosemary and Romeo begin both with a letter?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROM.</speaker>
<line>Ay, nurse, what of that? Both with an R.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NURSE.</speaker>
<line>Ah, mocker, that&#8217;s the dog&#8217;s name. R is for the&#8212;no, I know it begins with some other letter&#8212;and she hath the prettiest sententious of it, of you and rosemary, that it would do you good to hear it.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROM.</speaker>
<line>Commend me to thy lady.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NURSE.</speaker>
<line>Ay, a thousand times.</line>

<line>The clock strook nine when I did send the nurse;</line>
<line>In half an hour she promised to return.</line>
<line>Perchance she cannot meet him&#8212;that&#8217;s not so.</line>
<line>O, she is lame! Love&#8217;s heralds should be thoughts,</line>
<line>Which ten times faster glides than the sun&#8217;s beams,</line>
<line>Driving back shadows over low&#8217;ring hills;</line>
<line>Therefore do nimble-pinion&#8217;d doves draw Love,</line>

<line>Now is the sun upon the highmost hill</line>
<line>Of this day&#8217;s journey, and from nine till twelve</line>
<line>Is three long hours, yet she is not come.</line>
<line>Had she affections and warm youthful blood,</line>
<line>She would be as swift in motion as a ball;</line>
<line>My words would bandy her to my sweet love,</line>
<line>And his to me.</line>
<line>But old folks&#8212;many feign as they were dead,</line>
<line>Unwieldy, slow, heavy, and pale as lead.</line>

<stagedir>Enter Nurse and Peter.</stagedir>
<line>O God, she comes! O honey nurse, what news?</line>
<line>Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.</line>

<speaker>JUL.</speaker>
<line>Now, good sweet nurse&#8212;O Lord, why lookest thou sad?</line>
<line>Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;</line>
<line>If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news</line>
<line>By playing it to me with so sour a face.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NURSE.</speaker>
<line>I am a-weary, give me leave a while.</line>
<line>Fie, how my bones ache! What a jaunce have I!</line>

<line>Jesu, what haste! Can you not stay a while?</line>
<line>Do you not see that I am out of breath?</line>

<line>How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath</line>
<line>To say to me that thou art out of breath?</line>
<line>The excuse that thou dost make in this delay</line>
<line>Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.</line>
<line>Is thy news good or bad? Answer to that.</line>
<line>Say either, and I&#8217;ll stay the circumstance.</line>
<line>Let me be satisfied, is&#8217;t good or bad?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>NURSE.</speaker>
<line>Well, you have made a simple choice, you know not how to choose a man. Romeo! No, not he. Though his face be better than any man&#8217;s, yet his leg excels all men&#8217;s, and for a hand and a foot and a body, though they be not to be talk&#8217;d on, yet they are past compare. He is not the flower of courtesy, but I&#8217;ll warrant him, as gentle as a lamb. Go thy ways, wench, serve God. What, have you din&#8217;d at home?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JUL.</speaker>
<line>No, no! But all this did I know before.</line>
<line>What says he of our marriage? What of that?</line>

<speech>
<speaker>NURSE.</speaker>
<line>Lord, how my head aches! What a head have I!</line>
<line>It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.</line>

<line>Beshrew your heart for sending me about</line>

<speaker>JUL.</speaker>
<line>I&#8217; faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.</line>
<line>Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?</line>

<speech>
<speaker>NURSE.</speaker>
<line>Your love says, like an honest gentleman,</line>

<speaker>FRI. L.</speaker>
<line>So smile the heavens upon this holy act,</line>
<line>That after-hours with sorrow chide us not!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>ROM.</speaker>
<line>Amen, amen! But come what sorrow can,</line>
<line>It cannot countervail the exchange of joy</line>
<line>That one short minute gives me in her sight.</line>
<line>Do thou but close our hands with holy words,</line>
<line>Then love-devouring death do what he dare,</line>
<line>It is enough I may but call her mine.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FRI. L.</speaker>
<line>These violent delights have violent ends,</line>
<line>And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,</line>
<line>Which as they kiss consume. The sweetest honey</line>
<line>Is loathsome in his own deliciousness,</line>
<line>And in the taste confounds the appetite.</line>
<line>Therefore love moderately: long love doth so;</line>
<line>Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.</line>

<stagedir>Enter Juliet.</stagedir>
<line>Here comes the lady. O, so light a foot</line>
<line>Will ne&#8217;er wear out the everlasting flint;</line>
<line>A lover may bestride the gossamers</line>
<line>That idles in the wanton summer air,</line>

</speech>

<speaker>JUL.</speaker>
<line>Good even to my ghostly confessor.</line>

<speech>
<speaker>FRI. L.</speaker>
<line>Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.</line>

<line>Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy</line>

<line>To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath</line>
<line>This neighbor air, and let rich music&#8217;s tongue</line>
<line>Unfold the imagin&#8217;d happiness that both</line>
<line>Receive in either by this dear encounter.</line>

<line>Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,</line>
<line>Brags of his substance, not of ornament;</line>
<line>They are but beggars that can count their worth,</line>
<line>But my true love is grown to such excess</line>
<line>I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.</line>
</speech>

<speech>

<line>Come, come with me, and we will make short work,</line>

<speaker>MER.</speaker>
<line>Thou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters the confines of a tavern, claps me his sword upon the table, and says, &#8220;God send me no need of thee!&#8221; and by the operation of the second cup draws him on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.</line>

<speaker>BEN.</speaker>
<line>And what to?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MER.</speaker>
<line>Nay, and there were two such, we should have none shortly, for one would kill the other. Thou? Why, thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast. Thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes. What eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel? Thy head is as full of quarrels as an egg is full of meat, and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as an egg for quarrelling. Thou hast quarrell&#8217;d with a man for coughing in the street, because he hath waken&#8217;d thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun. Didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter? With another for tying his new shoes with old riband? And yet thou wilt tutor me from quarrelling!</line>

<line>And I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man should buy the fee-simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.</line>

<line>O noble Prince, I can discover all</line>
<line>The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl:</line>
<line>There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,</line>
<line>That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.</line>
</speech>

<speech>

<line>Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother&#8217;s child!</line>
<line>O Prince! O husband! O, the blood is spill&#8217;d</line>
<line>Of my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,</line>
<line>For blood of ours, shed blood of Montague.</line>
<line>O cousin, cousin!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRIN.</speaker>
<line>Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BEN.</speaker>
<line>Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo&#8217;s hand did slay!</line>
<line>Romeo that spoke him fair, bid him bethink</line>
<line>How nice the quarrel was, and urg&#8217;d withal</line>
<line>Your high displeasure; all this, uttered</line>
<line>With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bowed,</line>
<line>Could not take truce with the unruly spleen</line>
<line>Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts</line>
<line>With piercing steel at bold Mercutio&#8217;s breast,</line>
<line>Who, all as hot, turns deadly point to point,</line>
<line>And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats</line>
<line>Cold death aside, and with the other sends</line>
<line>It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity</line>
<line>Retorts it. Romeo he cries aloud,</line>
<line>&#8220;Hold, friends! Friends, part!&#8221; and swifter than his tongue,</line>
<line>His agile arm beats down their fatal points,</line>
<line>And &#8217;twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm</line>
<line>An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life</line>
<line>Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;</line>
<line>But by and by comes back to Romeo,</line>
<line>Who had but newly entertain&#8217;d revenge,</line>
<line>And to&#8217;t they go like lightning, for, ere I</line>
<line>Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain;</line>
<line>And as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.</line>
<line>This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>LA. CAP.</speaker>
<line>He is a kinsman to the Montague,</line>
<line>Affection makes him false, he speaks not true.</line>
<line>Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,</line>
<line>And all those twenty could but kill one life.</line>
<line>I beg for justice, which thou, Prince, must give:</line>
<line>Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRIN.</speaker>
<line>Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio;</line>
<line>Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?</line>

<line>Not Romeo, Prince, he was Mercutio&#8217;s friend;</line>

<line>But I&#8217;ll amerce you with so strong a fine</line>

<line>I will be deaf to pleading and excuses,</line>
<line>Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses;</line>
<line>Therefore use none. Let Romeo hence in haste,</line>
<line>Else, when he is found, that hour is his last.</line>

<line>My father Capulet will have it so,</line>

<line>You say you do not know the lady&#8217;s mind?</line>
<line>Uneven is the course, I like it not.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAR.</speaker>
<line>Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt&#8217;s death,</line>
<line>And therefore have I little talk&#8217;d of love,</line>
<line>For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.</line>
<line>Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous</line>
<line>That she do give her sorrow so much sway;</line>
<line>And in his wisdom hastes our marriage,</line>
<line>To stop the inundation of her tears,</line>
<line>Which, too much minded by herself alone,</line>

<line>Poor soul, thy face is much abus&#8217;d with tears.</line>

<line>Thou wrong&#8217;st it more than tears with that report.</line>

<line>That is no slander, sir, which is a truth,</line>

<line>Thy face is mine, and thou hast sland&#8217;red it.</line>

<line>O Juliet, I already know thy grief,</line>
<line>It strains me past the compass of my wits.</line>
<line>I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,</line>
<line>On Thursday next be married to this County.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JUL.</speaker>
<line>Tell me not, friar, that thou hearest of this,</line>
<line>Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it.</line>
<line>If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help,</line>
<line>Do thou but call my resolution wise,</line>
<line>And with this knife I&#8217;ll help it presently.</line>
<line>God join&#8217;d my heart and Romeo&#8217;s, thou our hands,</line>
<line>And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo&#8217;s seal&#8217;d,</line>
<line>Shall be the label to another deed,</line>
<line>Or my true heart with treacherous revolt</line>
<line>Turn to another, this shall slay them both.</line>
<line>Therefore, out of thy long-experienc&#8217;d time,</line>
<line>Give me some present counsel, or, behold,</line>
<line>&#8217;Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife</line>
<line>Shall play the umpire, arbitrating that</line>
<line>Which the commission of thy years and art</line>
<line>Could to no issue of true honor bring.</line>
<line>Be not so long to speak, I long to die,</line>
<line>If what thou speak&#8217;st speak not of remedy.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FRI. L.</speaker>
<line>Hold, daughter! I do spy a kind of hope,</line>
<line>Which craves as desperate an execution</line>
<line>As that is desperate which we would prevent.</line>
<line>If rather than to marry County Paris,</line>
<line>Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,</line>
<line>Then is it likely thou wilt undertake</line>
<line>A thing like death to chide away this shame,</line>
<line>That cop&#8217;st with Death himself to scape from it;</line>
<line>And if thou darest, I&#8217;ll give thee remedy.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>JUL.</speaker>
<line>O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,</line>
<line>From off the battlements of any tower,</line>
<line>Or walk in thievish ways, or bid me lurk</line>
<line>Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears,</line>
<line>Or hide me nightly in a charnel-house,</line>
<line>O&#8217;ercover&#8217;d quite with dead men&#8217;s rattling bones,</line>
<line>With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;</line>
<line>Or bid me go into a new-made grave,</line>
<line>And hide me with a dead man in his shroud&#8212;</line>
<line>Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble&#8212;</line>
<line>And I will do it without fear or doubt,</line>
<line>To live an unstain&#8217;d wife to my sweet love.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FRI. L.</speaker>
<line>Hold then. Go home, be merry, give consent</line>
<line>To marry Paris. We&#8217;n&#8217;sday is tomorrow;</line>
<line>Tomorrow night look that thou lie alone,</line>
<line>Let not the nurse lie with thee in thy chamber.</line>
<line>Take thou this vial, being then in bed,</line>
<line>And this distilling liquor drink thou off,</line>
<line>When presently through all thy veins shall run</line>
<line>A cold and drowsy humor; for no pulse</line>
<line>Shall keep his native progress, but surcease;</line>
<line>No warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest;</line>
<line>The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade</line>
<line>To wanny ashes, thy eyes&#8217; windows fall,</line>
<line>Like death when he shuts up the day of life;</line>
<line>Each part, depriv&#8217;d of supple government,</line>
<line>Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death,</line>
<line>And in this borrowed likeness of shrunk death</line>
<line>Thou shalt continue two and forty hours,</line>
<line>And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.</line>
<line>Now when the bridegroom in the morning comes</line>
<line>To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead.</line>
<line>Then, as the manner of our country is,</line>
<line>In thy best robes, uncovered on the bier,</line>
<line>Thou shall be borne to that same ancient vault</line>
<line>Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.</line>
<line>In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,</line>
<line>Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,</line>
<line>And hither shall he come, an&#8217; he and I</line>
<line>Will watch thy waking, and that very night</line>
<line>Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.</line>
<line>And this shall free thee from this present shame,</line>
<line>If no inconstant toy, nor womanish fear,</line>
<line>Abate thy valor in the acting it.</line>
</speech>

<speaker>JUL.</speaker>
<line>Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!</line>

<speech>
<speaker>FRI. L.</speaker>
<line>Hold, get you gone. Be strong and prosperous</line>
<line>In this resolve. I&#8217;ll send a friar with speed</line>
<line>To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.</line>

<line>Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.</line>
<line>Hold, take this letter; early in the morning</line>
<line>See thou deliver it to my lord and father.</line>
<line>Give me the light. Upon thy life I charge thee,</line>
<line>What e&#8217;er thou hearest or seest, stand all aloof,</line>
<line>And do not interrupt me in my course.</line>
<line>Why I descend into this bed of death</line>
<line>Is partly to behold my lady&#8217;s face,</line>
<line>But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger</line>
<line>A precious ring&#8212;a ring that I must use</line>
<line>In dear employment&#8212;therefore hence be gone.</line>
<line>But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry</line>
<line>In what I farther shall intend to do,</line>
<line>By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint,</line>
<line>And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs.</line>
<line>The time and my intents are savage-wild,</line>
<line>More fierce and more inexorable far</line>
<line>Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.</line>

<line>Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,</line>

<stagedir>Steps forth.</stagedir>
<line>Stop thy unhallowed toil, vile Montague!</line>

<line>In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.</line>
<line>Mercutio&#8217;s kinsman, noble County Paris!</line>
<line>What said my man, when my betossed soul</line>
<line>Did not attend him as we rode? I think</line>
<line>He told me Paris should have married Juliet.</line>
<line>Said he not so? Or did I dream it so?</line>
<line>Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,</line>
<line>To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,</line>
<line>One writ with me in sour misfortune&#8217;s book!</line>
<line>I&#8217;ll bury thee in a triumphant grave.</line>
<line>A grave? O no, a lantern, slaught&#8217;red youth;</line>
<line>For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes</line>
<line>This vault a feasting presence full of light.</line>
<line>Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr&#8217;d.</line>

<stagedir>Laying Paris in the tomb.</stagedir>
<line>How oft when men are at the point of death</line>
<line>Have they been merry, which their keepers call</line>
<line>A lightning before death! O how may I</line>
<line>Call this a lightning? O my love, my wife,</line>
<line>Death, that hath suck&#8217;d the honey of thy breath,</line>
<line>Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty:</line>
<line>Thou art not conquer&#8217;d, beauty&#8217;s ensign yet</line>
<line>Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,</line>
<line>And death&#8217;s pale flag is not advanced there.</line>
<line>Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?</line>
<line>O, what more favor can I do to thee,</line>
<line>Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain</line>
<line>To sunder his that was thine enemy?</line>
<line>Forgive me, cousin! Ah, dear Juliet,</line>
<line>Why art thou yet so fair? Shall I believe</line>
<line>That unsubstantial Death is amorous,</line>
<line>And that the lean abhorred monster keeps</line>
<line>Thee here in dark to be his paramour?</line>
<line>For fear of that, I still will stay with thee,</line>
<line>And never from this palace of dim night</line>
<line>Depart again. Here, here will I remain</line>
<line>With worms that are thy chambermaids; O, here</line>
<line>Will I set up my everlasting rest,</line>
<line>And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars</line>
<line>From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!</line>
<line>Arms, take your last embrace! And, lips, O you</line>
<line>The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss</line>
<line>A dateless bargain to engrossing death!</line>
<line>Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavory guide!</line>
<line>Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on</line>
<line>The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark!</line>
<line>Here&#8217;s to my love!</line>

<line>A greater power than we can contradict</line>

<line>Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end.</line>
<line>O churl, drunk all, and left no friendly drop</line>

<line>And it mis-sheathed in my daughter&#8217;s bosom!</line>

<speech>
<speaker>LA. CAP.</speaker>
<line>O me, this sight of death is as a bell</line>
<line>That warns my old age to a sepulchre.</line>
</speech>

<stagedir>Enter Montague and others.</stagedir>

<speech>
<speaker>PRIN.</speaker>
<line>Come, Montague, for thou art early up</line>
<line>To see thy son and heir now early down.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MON.</speaker>
<line>Alas, my liege, my wife is dead tonight;</line>
<line>Grief of my son&#8217;s exile hath stopp&#8217;d her breath.</line>
<line>What further woe conspires against mine age?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRIN.</speaker>
<line>Look and thou shalt see.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MON.</speaker>
<line>O thou untaught! What manners is in this,</line>
<line>To press before thy father to a grave?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRIN.</speaker>
<line>Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,</line>
<line>Till we can clear these ambiguities,</line>
<line>And know their spring, their head, their true descent,</line>
<line>And then will I be general of your woes,</line>
<line>And lead you even to death. Mean time forbear,</line>
<line>And let mischance be slave to patience.</line>
<line>Bring forth the parties of suspicion.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FRI. L.</speaker>
<line>I am the greatest, able to do least,</line>
<line>Yet most suspected, as the time and place</line>
<line>Doth make against me, of this direful murder;</line>
<line>And here I stand both to impeach and purge</line>
<line>Myself condemned and myself excus&#8217;d.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRIN.</speaker>
<line>Then say at once what thou dost know in this.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FRI. L.</speaker>
<line>I will be brief, for my short date of breath</line>
<line>Is not so long as is a tedious tale.</line>
<line>Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet,</line>
<line>And she, there dead, that Romeo&#8217;s faithful wife.</line>
<line>I married them, and their stol&#8217;n marriage-day</line>
<line>Was Tybalt&#8217;s dooms-day, whose untimely death</line>
<line>Banish&#8217;d the new-made bridegroom from this city,</line>
<line>For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin&#8217;d.</line>
<line>You, to remove that siege of grief from her,</line>
<line>Betroth&#8217;d and would have married her perforce</line>
<line>To County Paris. Then comes she to me,</line>
<line>And with wild looks bid me devise some mean</line>
<line>To rid her from this second marriage,</line>
<line>Or in my cell there would she kill herself.</line>
<line>Then gave I her (so tutor&#8217;d by my art)</line>
<line>A sleeping potion, which so took effect</line>
<line>As I intended, for it wrought on her</line>
<line>The form of death. Mean time I writ to Romeo,</line>
<line>That he should hither come as this dire night</line>
<line>To help to take her from her borrowed grave,</line>
<line>Being the time the potion&#8217;s force should cease.</line>
<line>But he which bore my letter, Friar John,</line>
<line>Was stayed by accident, and yesternight</line>
<line>Return&#8217;d my letter back. Then all alone,</line>
<line>At the prefixed hour of her waking,</line>
<line>Came I to take her from her kindred&#8217;s vault,</line>
<line>Meaning to keep her closely at my cell,</line>
<line>Till I conveniently could send to Romeo.</line>
<line>But when I came, some minute ere the time</line>
<line>Of her awakening, here untimely lay</line>
<line>The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.</line>
<line>She wakes, and I entreated her come forth</line>
<line>And bear this work of heaven with patience.</line>
<line>But then a noise did scare me from the tomb,</line>
<line>And she, too desperate, would not go with me,</line>
<line>But as it seems, did violence on herself.</line>
<line>All this I know, and to the marriage</line>
<line>Her nurse is privy; and if aught in this</line>
<line>Miscarried by my fault, let my old life</line>
<line>Be sacrific&#8217;d some hour before his time,</line>
<line>Unto the rigor of severest law.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRIN.</speaker>
<line>We still have known thee for a holy man.</line>
<line>Where&#8217;s Romeo&#8217;s man? What can he say to this?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BAL.</speaker>
<line>I brought my master news of Juliet&#8217;s death,</line>
<line>And then in post he came from Mantua</line>
<line>To this same place, to this same monument.</line>
<line>This letter he early bid me give his father,</line>
<line>And threat&#8217;ned me with death, going in the vault,</line>
<line>If I departed not and left him there.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRIN.</speaker>
<line>Give me the letter, I will look on it.</line>
<line>Where is the County&#8217;s page that rais&#8217;d the watch?</line>
<line>Sirrah, what made your master in this place?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAGE.</speaker>
<line>He came with flowers to strew his lady&#8217;s grave,</line>
<line>And bid me stand aloof, and so I did.</line>
<line>Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb,</line>
<line>And by and by my master drew on him,</line>
<line>And then I ran away to call the watch.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRIN.</speaker>
<line>This letter doth make good the friar&#8217;s words,</line>
<line>Their course of love, the tidings of her death;</line>
<line>And here he writes that he did buy a poison</line>
<line>Of a poor pothecary, and therewithal</line>
<line>Came to this vault, to die and lie with Juliet.</line>
<line>Where be these enemies? Capulet! Montague!</line>
<line>See what a scourge is laid upon your hate,</line>
<line>That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love.</line>
<line>And I for winking at your discords too</line>
<line>Have lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punish&#8217;d.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CAP.</speaker>
<line>O brother Montague, give me thy hand.</line>
<line>This is my daughter&#8217;s jointure, for no more</line>
<line>Can I demand.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MON.</speaker>
<line offset="3">But I can give thee more,</line>
<line>For I will raise her statue in pure gold,</line>
<line>That whiles Verona by that name is known,</line>
<line>There shall no figure at such rate be set</line>
<line>As that of true and faithful Juliet.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CAP.</speaker>
<line>As rich shall Romeo&#8217;s by his lady&#8217;s lie,</line>
<line>Poor sacrifices of our enmity!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRIN.</speaker>
<line>A glooming peace this morning with it brings,</line>
<line>The sun, for sorrow, will not show his head.</line>
<line>Go hence to have more talk of these sad things;</line>
<line>Some shall be pardon&#8217;d, and some punished:</line>
<line>For never was a story of more woe</line>
<line>Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.</line>
