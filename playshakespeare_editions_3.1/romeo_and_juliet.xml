<LINE>Two households, both alike in dignity,</LINE>
<LINE>In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,</LINE>
<LINE>From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,</LINE>
<LINE>Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.</LINE>
<LINE>From forth the fatal loins of these two foes</LINE>
<LINE>A pair of star-cross&#8217;d lovers take their life;</LINE>
<LINE>Whose misadventur&#8217;d piteous overthrows</LINE>
<LINE>Doth with their death bury their parents&#8217; strife.</LINE>
<LINE>The fearful passage of their death-mark&#8217;d love,</LINE>
<LINE>And the continuance of their parents&#8217; rage,</LINE>
<LINE>Which, but their children&#8217;s end, nought could remove,</LINE>
<LINE>Is now the two hours&#8217; traffic of our stage;</LINE>
<LINE>The which if you with patient ears attend,</LINE>
<LINE>What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.</LINE>

<LINE>Gregory, on my word, we&#8217;ll not carry coals.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, for then we should be colliers.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I mean, and we be in choler, we&#8217;ll draw.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, while you live, draw your neck out of collar.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I strike quickly, being mov&#8217;d.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But thou art not quickly mov&#8217;d to strike.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A dog of the house of Montague moves me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To move is to stir, and to be valiant is to stand; therefore, if thou art mov&#8217;d, thou run&#8217;st away.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A dog of that house shall move me to stand! I will take the wall of any man or maid of Montague&#8217;s.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That shows thee a weak slave, for the weakest goes to the wall.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis true, and therefore women, being the weaker vessels, are ever thrust to the wall; therefore I will push Montague&#8217;s men from the wall, and thrust his maids to the wall.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The quarrel is between our masters, and us their men.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis all one; I will show myself a tyrant: when I have fought with the men, I will be civil with the maids; I will cut off their heads.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The heads of the maids?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads, take it in what sense thou wilt.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>They must take it in sense that feel it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRE.</SPEAKER>

<SPEAKER>GRE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as they list.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SAM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them, which is disgrace to them if they bear it.</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TYB.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, drawn and talk of peace? I hate the word</LINE>
<LINE>As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee.</LINE>
<LINE>Have at thee, coward!</LINE>
</SPEECH>
<STAGEDIR>They fight.</STAGEDIR>

<STAGEDIR>Enter three or four Citizens with clubs or partisans.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CITIZENS.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Clubs, bills, and partisans! Strike! Beat them down!</LINE>
<LINE>Down with the Capulets! Down with the Montagues!</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRIN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,</LINE>
<LINE>Profaners of this neighbor-stained steel&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Will they not hear?&#8212;What ho, you men, you beasts!</LINE>
<LINE>That quench the fire of your pernicious rage</LINE>
<LINE>With purple fountains issuing from your veins&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>On pain of torture, from those bloody hands</LINE>
<LINE>Throw your mistempered weapons to the ground,</LINE>
<LINE>And hear the sentence of your moved prince.</LINE>
<LINE>Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,</LINE>
<LINE>By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,</LINE>
<LINE>Have thrice disturb&#8217;d the quiet of our streets,</LINE>
<LINE>And made Verona&#8217;s ancient citizens</LINE>
<LINE>Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments</LINE>
<LINE>To wield old partisans, in hands as old,</LINE>
<LINE>Cank&#8217;red with peace, to part your cank&#8217;red hate;</LINE>
<LINE>If ever you disturb our streets again</LINE>
<LINE>Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.</LINE>
<LINE>For this time all the rest depart away.</LINE>
<LINE>You, Capulet, shall go along with me,</LINE>
<LINE>And, Montague, come you this afternoon,</LINE>
<LINE>To know our farther pleasure in this case,</LINE>
<LINE>To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.</LINE>
<LINE>Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt all but Montague, Lady Montague, and Benvolio.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?</LINE>
<LINE>Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here were the servants of your adversary,</LINE>
<LINE>And yours, close fighting ere I did approach.</LINE>
<LINE>I drew to part them. In the instant came</LINE>
<LINE>The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Which, as he breath&#8217;d defiance to my ears,</LINE>
<LINE>He swung about his head and cut the winds,</LINE>
<LINE>Who, nothing hurt withal, hiss&#8217;d him in scorn.</LINE>
<LINE>While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,</LINE>
<LINE>Came more and more, and fought on part and part,</LINE>
<LINE>Till the Prince came, who parted either part.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LA. MON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, where is Romeo? Saw you him today?</LINE>
<LINE>Right glad I am he was not at this fray.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Madam, an hour before the worshipp&#8217;d sun</LINE>
<LINE>Peer&#8217;d forth the golden window of the east,</LINE>
<LINE>A troubled mind drive me to walk abroad,</LINE>
<LINE>Where, underneath the grove of sycamore</LINE>
<LINE>That westward rooteth from this city side,</LINE>
<LINE>So early walking did I see your son.</LINE>
<LINE>Towards him I made, but he was ware of me,</LINE>
<LINE>And stole into the covert of the wood.</LINE>
<LINE>I, measuring his affections by my own,</LINE>
<LINE>Which then most sought where most might not be found,</LINE>
<LINE>Being one too many by my weary self,</LINE>
<LINE>Pursued my humor not pursuing his,</LINE>
<LINE>And gladly shunn&#8217;d who gladly fled from me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Many a morning hath he there been seen,</LINE>
<LINE>With tears augmenting the fresh morning&#8217;s dew,</LINE>
<LINE>Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs,</LINE>
<LINE>But all so soon as the all-cheering sun</LINE>
<LINE>Should in the farthest east begin to draw</LINE>
<LINE>The shady curtains from Aurora&#8217;s bed,</LINE>
<LINE>Away from light steals home my heavy son,</LINE>
<LINE>And private in his chamber pens himself,</LINE>
<LINE>Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out,</LINE>
<LINE>And makes himself an artificial night.</LINE>
<LINE>Black and portendous must this humor prove,</LINE>
<LINE>Unless good counsel may the cause remove.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My noble uncle, do you know the cause?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I neither know it, nor can learn of him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Have you importun&#8217;d him by any means?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Both by myself and many other friends,</LINE>
<LINE>But he, his own affections&#8217; counsellor,</LINE>
<LINE>Is to himself (I will not say how true)</LINE>
<LINE>But to himself so secret and so close,</LINE>
<LINE>So far from sounding and discovery,</LINE>
<LINE>As is the bud bit with an envious worm,</LINE>
<LINE>Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air</LINE>
<LINE>Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.</LINE>
<LINE>Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,</LINE>
<LINE>We would as willingly give cure as know.</LINE>
</SPEECH>
<STAGEDIR>Enter Romeo.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>See where he comes. So please you step aside,</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll know his grievance, or be much denied.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would thou wert so happy by thy stay</LINE>
<LINE>To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let&#8217;s away.</LINE>
</SPEECH>
<STAGEDIR>Exeunt Montague and Lady.</STAGEDIR>

<LINE offset="4">Ay me, sad hours seem long.</LINE>
<LINE>Was that my father that went hence so fast?</LINE>

<LINE>It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo&#8217;s hours?</LINE>

<LINE>Out of her favor where I am in love.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alas that love, so gentle in his view,</LINE>
<LINE>Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alas that love, whose view is muffled still,</LINE>
<LINE>Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!</LINE>
<LINE>Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?</LINE>
<LINE>Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all:</LINE>
<LINE>Here&#8217;s much to do with hate, but more with love.</LINE>
<LINE>Why then, O brawling love! O loving hate!</LINE>
<LINE>O any thing, of nothing first create!</LINE>
<LINE>O heavy lightness, serious vanity,</LINE>
<LINE>Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms,</LINE>
<LINE>Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health,</LINE>
<LINE>Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!</LINE>
<LINE>This love feel I, that feel no love in this.</LINE>
<LINE>Dost thou not laugh?</LINE>

<SPEAKER>BEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="4">At thy good heart&#8217;s oppression.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, such is love&#8217;s transgression.</LINE>
<LINE>Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,</LINE>
<LINE>Which thou wilt propagate to have it press&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>With more of thine. This love that thou hast shown</LINE>
<LINE>Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.</LINE>
<LINE>Love is a smoke made with the fume of sighs,</LINE>
<LINE>Being purg&#8217;d, a fire sparkling in lovers&#8217; eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>Being vex&#8217;d, a sea nourish&#8217;d with loving tears.</LINE>
<LINE>What is it else? A madness most discreet,</LINE>
<LINE>A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.</LINE>
<LINE>Farewell, my coz.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>Bid a sick man in sadness make his will&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>A word ill urg&#8217;d to one that is so ill!</LINE>
<LINE>In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, in that hit you miss: she&#8217;ll not be hit</LINE>
<LINE>With Cupid&#8217;s arrow, she hath Dian&#8217;s wit;</LINE>
<LINE>And in strong proof of chastity well arm&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>From Love&#8217;s weak childish bow she lives uncharm&#8217;d.</LINE>
<LINE>She will not stay the siege of loving terms,</LINE>

<LINE>Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold.</LINE>
<LINE>O, she is rich in beauty, only poor</LINE>
<LINE>That, when she dies, with beauty dies her store.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste;</LINE>
<LINE>For beauty starv&#8217;d with her severity</LINE>
<LINE>Cuts beauty off from all posterity.</LINE>
<LINE>She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,</LINE>
<LINE>To merit bliss by making me despair.</LINE>
<LINE>She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow</LINE>
<LINE>Do I live dead that live to tell it now.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Be rul&#8217;d by me, forget to think of her.</LINE>

<LINE>O, teach me how I should forget to think.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By giving liberty unto thine eyes:</LINE>
<LINE>Examine other beauties.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="5">&#8217;Tis the way</LINE>
<LINE>To call hers (exquisite) in question more.</LINE>
<LINE>These happy masks that kiss fair ladies&#8217; brows,</LINE>
<LINE>Being black, puts us in mind they hide the fair.</LINE>
<LINE>He that is strooken blind cannot forget</LINE>
<LINE>The precious treasure of his eyesight lost.</LINE>
<LINE>Show me a mistress that is passing fair,</LINE>

<LINE>Sometime she gallops o&#8217;er a courtier&#8217;s nose,</LINE>
<LINE>And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;</LINE>
<LINE>And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig&#8217;s tail</LINE>
<LINE>Tickling a parson&#8217;s nose as &#8217;a lies asleep,</LINE>
<LINE>Then he dreams of another benefice.</LINE>
<LINE>Sometime she driveth o&#8217;er a soldier&#8217;s neck,</LINE>
<LINE>And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,</LINE>
<LINE>Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,</LINE>
<LINE>Of healths five fathom deep; and then anon</LINE>
<LINE>Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,</LINE>
<LINE>And being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two,</LINE>
<LINE>And sleeps again. This is that very Mab</LINE>
<LINE>That plats the manes of horses in the night,</LINE>
<LINE>And bakes the elf-locks in foul sluttish hairs,</LINE>
<LINE>Which, once untangled, much misfortune bodes.</LINE>
<LINE>This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,</LINE>

<LINE>Making them women of good carriage.</LINE>

<LINE>Deny thy father and refuse thy name;</LINE>
<LINE>Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JUL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>&#8217;Tis but thy name that is my enemy;</LINE>
<LINE>Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.</LINE>
<LINE>What&#8217;s Montague? It is nor hand nor foot,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor arm nor face, nor any other part</LINE>
<LINE>Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!</LINE>
<LINE>What&#8217;s in a name? That which we call a rose</LINE>
<LINE>By any other word would smell as sweet;</LINE>
<LINE>So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>Retain that dear perfection which he owes</LINE>
<LINE>Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,</LINE>
<LINE>And for thy name, which is no part of thee,</LINE>
<LINE>Take all myself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE offset="3">I take thee at thy word.</LINE>

<LINE>What man art thou that thus bescreen&#8217;d in night</LINE>
<LINE>So stumblest on my counsel?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="6">By a name</LINE>
<LINE>I know not how to tell thee who I am.</LINE>
<LINE>My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,</LINE>
<LINE>Because it is an enemy to thee;</LINE>
<LINE>Had I it written, I would tear the word.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JUL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My ears have yet not drunk a hundred words</LINE>
<LINE>Of thy tongue&#8217;s uttering, yet I know the sound.</LINE>
<LINE>Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JUL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?</LINE>
<LINE>The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,</LINE>
<LINE>And the place death, considering who thou art,</LINE>
<LINE>If any of my kinsmen find thee here.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>With love&#8217;s light wings did I o&#8217;erperch these walls,</LINE>
<LINE>For stony limits cannot hold love out,</LINE>
<LINE>And what love can do, that dares love attempt;</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JUL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If they do see thee, they will murder thee.</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye</LINE>
<LINE>Than twenty of their swords! Look thou but sweet,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JUL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would not for the world they saw thee here.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have night&#8217;s cloak to hide me from their eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>And but thou love me, let them find me here;</LINE>
<LINE>My life were better ended by their hate,</LINE>
<LINE>Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JUL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By whose direction foundst thou out this place?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ROM.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By love, that first did prompt me to inquire;</LINE>
<LINE>He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes.</LINE>
<LINE>I am no pilot, yet, wert thou as far</LINE>
<LINE>As that vast shore wash&#8217;d with the farthest sea,</LINE>
<LINE>I should adventure for such merchandise.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JUL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face,</LINE>
<LINE>Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek</LINE>
<LINE>For that which thou hast heard me speak tonight.</LINE>
<LINE>Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny</LINE>
<LINE>What I have spoke, but farewell compliment!</LINE>
<LINE>Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say, &#8220;Ay,&#8221;</LINE>
<LINE>And I will take thy word; yet, if thou swear&#8217;st,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou mayest prove false: at lovers&#8217; perjuries</LINE>
<LINE>They say Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,</LINE>
<LINE>If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully;</LINE>
<LINE>Or if thou thinkest I am too quickly won,</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll frown and be perverse, and say thee nay,</LINE>
<LINE>So thou wilt woo, but else not for the world.</LINE>
<LINE>In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore thou mayest think my behavior light,</LINE>
<LINE>But trust me, gentleman, I&#8217;ll prove more true</LINE>
<LINE>Than those that have more coying to be strange.</LINE>
<LINE>I should have been more strange, I must confess,</LINE>
<LINE>But that thou overheardst, ere I was ware,</LINE>
<LINE>My true-love passion; therefore pardon me,</LINE>
<LINE>And not impute this yielding to light love,</LINE>
<LINE>Which the dark night hath so discovered.</LINE>

<LINE>The day to cheer and night&#8217;s dank dew to dry,</LINE>
<LINE>I must up-fill this osier cage of ours</LINE>

<LINE>The earth that&#8217;s nature&#8217;s mother is her tomb;</LINE>
<LINE>What is her burying grave, that is her womb;</LINE>
<LINE>And from her womb children of divers kind</LINE>
<LINE>We sucking on her natural bosom find:</LINE>
<LINE>Many for many virtues excellent,</LINE>
<LINE>None but for some, and yet all different.</LINE>
<LINE>O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies</LINE>
<LINE>In plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities;</LINE>
<LINE>For nought so vile that on the earth doth live</LINE>
<LINE>But to the earth some special good doth give;</LINE>
<LINE>Nor aught so good but, strain&#8217;d from that fair use,</LINE>
<LINE>Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse.</LINE>
<LINE>Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied,</LINE>

<LINE>Within the infant rind of this weak flower</LINE>
<LINE>Poison hath residence and medicine power;</LINE>

<LINE>Two such opposed kings encamp them still</LINE>

<LINE>Nay, and there were two such, we should have none shortly, for one would kill the other. Thou? Why, thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast. Thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes. What eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel? Thy head is as full of quarrels as an egg is full of meat, and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as an egg for quarrelling. Thou hast quarrell&#8217;d with a man for coughing in the street, because he hath waken&#8217;d thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun. Didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter? With another for tying his new shoes with old riband? And yet thou wilt tutor me from quarrelling!</LINE>

<SPEAKER>BEN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo&#8217;s hand did slay!</LINE>
<LINE>Romeo that spoke him fair, bid him bethink</LINE>
<LINE>How nice the quarrel was, and urg&#8217;d withal</LINE>
<LINE>Your high displeasure; all this, uttered</LINE>
<LINE>With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bowed,</LINE>
<LINE>Could not take truce with the unruly spleen</LINE>
<LINE>Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts</LINE>
<LINE>With piercing steel at bold Mercutio&#8217;s breast,</LINE>
<LINE>Who, all as hot, turns deadly point to point,</LINE>
<LINE>And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats</LINE>
<LINE>Cold death aside, and with the other sends</LINE>
<LINE>It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity</LINE>
<LINE>Retorts it. Romeo he cries aloud,</LINE>
<LINE>&#8220;Hold, friends! Friends, part!&#8221; and swifter than his tongue,</LINE>
<LINE>His agile arm beats down their fatal points,</LINE>
<LINE>And &#8217;twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm</LINE>
<LINE>An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life</LINE>
<LINE>Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;</LINE>
<LINE>But by and by comes back to Romeo,</LINE>
<LINE>Who had but newly entertain&#8217;d revenge,</LINE>
<LINE>And to&#8217;t they go like lightning, for, ere I</LINE>
<LINE>Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain;</LINE>
<LINE>And as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.</LINE>
<LINE>This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.</LINE>

<LINE>Live here in heaven and may look on her,</LINE>
<LINE>But Romeo may not. More validity,</LINE>
<LINE>More honorable state, more courtship lives</LINE>

<LINE>And steal immortal blessing from her lips,</LINE>
<LINE>Who, even in pure and vestal modesty,</LINE>
<LINE>Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;</LINE>
<LINE>But Romeo may not, he is banished.</LINE>
<LINE>Flies may do this, but I from this must fly;</LINE>

<LINE>Is she not down so late, or up so early?</LINE>
<LINE>What unaccustom&#8217;d cause procures her hither?</LINE>

<LINE>Why, how now, Juliet?</LINE>

<LINE offset="5">Madam, I am not well.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LA. CAP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Evermore weeping for your cousin&#8217;s death?</LINE>
<LINE>What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?</LINE>
<LINE>And if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live;</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore have done. Some grief shows much of love,</LINE>
<LINE>But much of grief shows still some want of wit.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JUL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LA. CAP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend</LINE>

<LINE offset="4">Feeling so the loss,</LINE>
<LINE>I cannot choose but ever weep the friend.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LA. CAP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, girl, thou weep&#8217;st not so much for his death,</LINE>

<LINE>God pardon him! I do with all my heart;</LINE>
<LINE>And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LA. CAP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That is because the traitor murderer lives.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JUL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands.</LINE>
<LINE>Would none but I might venge my cousin&#8217;s death!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LA. CAP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not.</LINE>
<LINE>Then weep no more. I&#8217;ll send to one in Mantua,</LINE>
<LINE>Where that same banish&#8217;d runagate doth live,</LINE>
<LINE>Shall give him such an unaccustom&#8217;d dram</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Indeed I never shall be satisfied</LINE>
<LINE>With Romeo, till I behold him&#8212;dead&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Is my poor heart, so for a kinsman vex&#8217;d.</LINE>
<LINE>Madam, if you could find out but a man</LINE>
<LINE>To bear a poison, I would temper it,</LINE>
<LINE>That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,</LINE>
<LINE>Soon sleep in quiet. O how my heart abhors</LINE>
<LINE>To hear him nam&#8217;d, and cannot come to him</LINE>
<LINE>To wreak the love I bore my cousin</LINE>
<LINE>Upon his body that hath slaughter&#8217;d him!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>Find thou the means, and I&#8217;ll find such a man.</LINE>

<LINE>The gallant, young, and noble gentleman,</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>JUL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, by Saint Peter&#8217;s Church and Peter too,</LINE>
<LINE>He shall not make me there a joyful bride.</LINE>
<LINE>I wonder at this haste, that I must wed</LINE>
<LINE>Ere he that should be husband comes to woo.</LINE>
<LINE>I pray you tell my lord and father, madam,</LINE>
<LINE>I will not marry yet, and when I do, I swear</LINE>
<LINE>It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,</LINE>
<LINE>Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!</LINE>

<LINE>Thou counterfeits a bark, a sea, a wind:</LINE>
<LINE>For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,</LINE>
<LINE>Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,</LINE>
<LINE>Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs,</LINE>
<LINE>Who, raging with thy tears, and they with them,</LINE>
<LINE>Without a sudden calm, will overset</LINE>
<LINE>Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife?</LINE>

<LINE>O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,</LINE>

<LINE>Or hide me nightly in a charnel-house,</LINE>
<LINE>O&#8217;ercover&#8217;d quite with dead men&#8217;s rattling bones,</LINE>
<LINE>With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;</LINE>
<LINE>Or bid me go into a new-made grave,</LINE>
<LINE>And hide me with a dead man in his shroud&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble&#8212;</LINE>

<LINE>Take thou this vial, being then in bed,</LINE>
<LINE>And this distilling liquor drink thou off,</LINE>
<LINE>When presently through all thy veins shall run</LINE>
<LINE>A cold and drowsy humor; for no pulse</LINE>
<LINE>Shall keep his native progress, but surcease;</LINE>
<LINE>No warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest;</LINE>
<LINE>The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade</LINE>
<LINE>To wanny ashes, thy eyes&#8217; windows fall,</LINE>
<LINE>Like death when he shuts up the day of life;</LINE>
<LINE>Each part, depriv&#8217;d of supple government,</LINE>
<LINE>Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death,</LINE>
<LINE>And in this borrowed likeness of shrunk death</LINE>
<LINE>Thou shalt continue two and forty hours,</LINE>
<LINE>And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.</LINE>
<LINE>Now when the bridegroom in the morning comes</LINE>
<LINE>To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead.</LINE>
<LINE>Then, as the manner of our country is,</LINE>
<LINE>In thy best robes, uncovered on the bier,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou shall be borne to that same ancient vault</LINE>
<LINE>Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.</LINE>
<LINE>In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,</LINE>
<LINE>Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,</LINE>

<LINE>What if it be a poison which the friar</LINE>
<LINE>Subtly hath minist&#8217;red to have me dead,</LINE>
<LINE>Lest in this marriage he should be dishonor&#8217;d</LINE>
<LINE>Because he married me before to Romeo?</LINE>
<LINE>I fear it is, and yet methinks it should not,</LINE>
<LINE>For he hath still been tried a holy man.</LINE>
<LINE>How if, when I am laid into the tomb,</LINE>
<LINE>I wake before the time that Romeo</LINE>
<LINE>Come to redeem me? There&#8217;s a fearful point!</LINE>
<LINE>Shall I not then be stifled in the vault,</LINE>
<LINE>To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,</LINE>
<LINE>And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?</LINE>
<LINE>Or if I live, is it not very like</LINE>
<LINE>The horrible conceit of death and night,</LINE>
<LINE>Together with the terror of the place&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>As in a vault, an ancient receptacle,</LINE>
<LINE>Where for this many hundred years the bones</LINE>
<LINE>Of all my buried ancestors are pack&#8217;d,</LINE>

<LINE>Lies fest&#8217;ring in his shroud, where, as they say,</LINE>
<LINE>At some hours in the night spirits resort&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Alack, alack, is it not like that I,</LINE>
<LINE>So early waking&#8212;what with loathsome smells,</LINE>
<LINE>And shrikes like mandrakes&#8217; torn out of the earth,</LINE>
<LINE>That living mortals, hearing them, run mad&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,</LINE>
<LINE>Environed with all these hideous fears,</LINE>
<LINE>And madly play with my forefathers&#8217; joints,</LINE>
<LINE>And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud,</LINE>
<LINE>And in this rage, with some great kinsman&#8217;s bone,</LINE>
<LINE>As with a club, dash out my desp&#8217;rate brains?</LINE>
<LINE>O, look! Methinks I see my cousin&#8217;s ghost</LINE>
<LINE>Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body</LINE>
<LINE>Upon a rapier&#8217;s point. Stay, Tybalt, stay!</LINE>

<LINE>If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep,</LINE>
<LINE>My dreams presage some joyful news at hand.</LINE>
<LINE>My bosom&#8217;s lord sits lightly in his throne,</LINE>
<LINE>And all this day an unaccustom&#8217;d spirit</LINE>
<LINE>Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.</LINE>
<LINE>I dreamt my lady came and found me dead&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>Strange dream, that gives a dead man leave to think!&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>And breath&#8217;d such life with kisses in my lips</LINE>
<LINE>That I reviv&#8217;d and was an emperor.</LINE>
<LINE>Ah me, how sweet is love itself possess&#8217;d,</LINE>
<LINE>When but love&#8217;s shadows are so rich in joy!</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Romeo&#8217;s man Balthasar, booted.</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>News from Verona! How now, Balthasar?</LINE>
<LINE>Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?</LINE>
<LINE>How doth my lady? Is my father well?</LINE>
<LINE>How doth my Juliet? That I ask again,</LINE>
<LINE>For nothing can be ill if she be well.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then she is well and nothing can be ill:</LINE>
<LINE>Her body sleeps in Capel&#8217;s monument,</LINE>
<LINE>And her immortal part with angels lives.</LINE>
<LINE>I saw her laid low in her kindred&#8217;s vault,</LINE>
<LINE>And presently took post to tell it you.</LINE>
<LINE>O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,</LINE>
<LINE>Since you did leave it for my office, sir.</LINE>

<LINE>Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee tonight.</LINE>
<LINE>Let&#8217;s see for means. O mischief, thou art swift</LINE>
<LINE>To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!</LINE>
<LINE>I do remember an apothecary&#8212;</LINE>
<LINE>And hereabouts &#8217;a dwells&#8212;which late I noted</LINE>
<LINE>In tatt&#8217;red weeds, with overwhelming brows,</LINE>
<LINE>Culling of simples; meagre were his looks,</LINE>
<LINE>Sharp misery had worn him to the bones;</LINE>
<LINE>And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,</LINE>
<LINE>An alligator stuff&#8217;d, and other skins</LINE>
<LINE>Of ill-shap&#8217;d fishes, and about his shelves</LINE>
<LINE>A beggarly account of empty boxes,</LINE>
<LINE>Green earthen pots, bladders, and musty seeds,</LINE>
<LINE>Remnants of packthread, and old cakes of roses</LINE>
<LINE>Were thinly scattered, to make up a show.</LINE>
<LINE>Noting this penury, to myself I said,</LINE>
<LINE>&#8220;An&#8217; if a man did need a poison now,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose sale is present death in Mantua,</LINE>
<LINE>Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.&#8221;</LINE>
<LINE>O, this same thought did but forerun my need,</LINE>
<LINE>And this same needy man must sell it me.</LINE>
<LINE>As I remember, this should be the house.</LINE>
<LINE>Being holiday, the beggar&#8217;s shop is shut.</LINE>

<LINE>Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor.</LINE>
<LINE>Hold, there is forty ducats; let me have</LINE>
<LINE>A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear</LINE>
<LINE>As will disperse itself through all the veins</LINE>
<LINE>That the life-weary taker may fall dead,</LINE>
<LINE>And that the trunk may be discharg&#8217;d of breath</LINE>

<LINE>The world is not thy friend, nor the world&#8217;s law,</LINE>
<LINE>The world affords no law to make thee rich;</LINE>
<LINE>Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>AP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My poverty, but not my will, consents.</LINE>

<LINE>Under yond yew trees lay thee all along,</LINE>

<LINE>So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread,</LINE>
<LINE>Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves,</LINE>

<LINE>What e&#8217;er thou hearest or seest, stand all aloof,</LINE>
<LINE>And do not interrupt me in my course.</LINE>
<LINE>Why I descend into this bed of death</LINE>

<LINE>A precious ring&#8212;a ring that I must use</LINE>

<LINE>Did not attend him as we rode? I think</LINE>
<LINE>He told me Paris should have married Juliet.</LINE>
<LINE>Said he not so? Or did I dream it so?</LINE>
<LINE>Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,</LINE>
<LINE>To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,</LINE>
<LINE>One writ with me in sour misfortune&#8217;s book!</LINE>
<LINE>I&#8217;ll bury thee in a triumphant grave.</LINE>
<LINE>A grave? O no, a lantern, slaught&#8217;red youth;</LINE>

<LINE>O, what more favor can I do to thee,</LINE>

<LINE>Forgive me, cousin! Ah, dear Juliet,</LINE>
<LINE>Why art thou yet so fair? Shall I believe</LINE>
<LINE>That unsubstantial Death is amorous,</LINE>
<LINE>And that the lean abhorred monster keeps</LINE>
<LINE>Thee here in dark to be his paramour?</LINE>
<LINE>For fear of that, I still will stay with thee,</LINE>

<LINE>Depart again. Here, here will I remain</LINE>
<LINE>With worms that are thy chambermaids; O, here</LINE>
<LINE>Will I set up my everlasting rest,</LINE>

<LINE>From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!</LINE>
<LINE>Arms, take your last embrace! And, lips, O you</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LA. CAP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, the people in the street cry &#8220;Romeo,&#8221;</LINE>
<LINE>Some &#8220;Juliet,&#8221; and some &#8220;Paris,&#8221; and all run</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain,</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!</LINE>
<LINE>This dagger hath mista&#8217;en, for lo his house</LINE>
<LINE>Is empty on the back of Montague,</LINE>
<LINE>And it mis-sheathed in my daughter&#8217;s bosom!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LA. CAP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O me, this sight of death is as a bell</LINE>
<LINE>That warns my old age to a sepulchre.</LINE>
</SPEECH>
<STAGEDIR>Enter Montague and others.</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRIN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, Montague, for thou art early up</LINE>
<LINE>To see thy son and heir now early down.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alas, my liege, my wife is dead tonight;</LINE>
<LINE>Grief of my son&#8217;s exile hath stopp&#8217;d her breath.</LINE>
<LINE>What further woe conspires against mine age?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRIN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Look and thou shalt see.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O thou untaught! What manners is in this,</LINE>
<LINE>To press before thy father to a grave?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRIN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,</LINE>
<LINE>Till we can clear these ambiguities,</LINE>
<LINE>And know their spring, their head, their true descent,</LINE>
<LINE>And then will I be general of your woes,</LINE>
<LINE>And lead you even to death. Mean time forbear,</LINE>
<LINE>And let mischance be slave to patience.</LINE>
<LINE>Bring forth the parties of suspicion.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRI. L.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am the greatest, able to do least,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet most suspected, as the time and place</LINE>
<LINE>Doth make against me, of this direful murder;</LINE>
<LINE>And here I stand both to impeach and purge</LINE>
<LINE>Myself condemned and myself excus&#8217;d.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRIN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then say at once what thou dost know in this.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRI. L.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will be brief, for my short date of breath</LINE>
<LINE>Is not so long as is a tedious tale.</LINE>
<LINE>Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet,</LINE>
<LINE>And she, there dead, that Romeo&#8217;s faithful wife.</LINE>
<LINE>I married them, and their stol&#8217;n marriage-day</LINE>
<LINE>Was Tybalt&#8217;s dooms-day, whose untimely death</LINE>
<LINE>Banish&#8217;d the new-made bridegroom from this city,</LINE>
<LINE>For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin&#8217;d.</LINE>
<LINE>You, to remove that siege of grief from her,</LINE>
<LINE>Betroth&#8217;d and would have married her perforce</LINE>
<LINE>To County Paris. Then comes she to me,</LINE>
<LINE>And with wild looks bid me devise some mean</LINE>
<LINE>To rid her from this second marriage,</LINE>
<LINE>Or in my cell there would she kill herself.</LINE>
<LINE>Then gave I her (so tutor&#8217;d by my art)</LINE>
<LINE>A sleeping potion, which so took effect</LINE>
<LINE>As I intended, for it wrought on her</LINE>
<LINE>The form of death. Mean time I writ to Romeo,</LINE>
<LINE>That he should hither come as this dire night</LINE>
<LINE>To help to take her from her borrowed grave,</LINE>
<LINE>Being the time the potion&#8217;s force should cease.</LINE>
<LINE>But he which bore my letter, Friar John,</LINE>
<LINE>Was stayed by accident, and yesternight</LINE>
<LINE>Return&#8217;d my letter back. Then all alone,</LINE>
<LINE>At the prefixed hour of her waking,</LINE>
<LINE>Came I to take her from her kindred&#8217;s vault,</LINE>
<LINE>Meaning to keep her closely at my cell,</LINE>
<LINE>Till I conveniently could send to Romeo.</LINE>
<LINE>But when I came, some minute ere the time</LINE>
<LINE>Of her awakening, here untimely lay</LINE>
<LINE>The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.</LINE>
<LINE>She wakes, and I entreated her come forth</LINE>
<LINE>And bear this work of heaven with patience.</LINE>
<LINE>But then a noise did scare me from the tomb,</LINE>
<LINE>And she, too desperate, would not go with me,</LINE>
<LINE>But as it seems, did violence on herself.</LINE>
<LINE>All this I know, and to the marriage</LINE>
<LINE>Her nurse is privy; and if aught in this</LINE>
<LINE>Miscarried by my fault, let my old life</LINE>
<LINE>Be sacrific&#8217;d some hour before his time,</LINE>
<LINE>Unto the rigor of severest law.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRIN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We still have known thee for a holy man.</LINE>
<LINE>Where&#8217;s Romeo&#8217;s man? What can he say to this?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAL.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I brought my master news of Juliet&#8217;s death,</LINE>
<LINE>And then in post he came from Mantua</LINE>
<LINE>To this same place, to this same monument.</LINE>
<LINE>This letter he early bid me give his father,</LINE>
<LINE>And threat&#8217;ned me with death, going in the vault,</LINE>
<LINE>If I departed not and left him there.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRIN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Give me the letter, I will look on it.</LINE>
<LINE>Where is the County&#8217;s page that rais&#8217;d the watch?</LINE>
<LINE>Sirrah, what made your master in this place?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PAGE.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He came with flowers to strew his lady&#8217;s grave,</LINE>
<LINE>And bid me stand aloof, and so I did.</LINE>
<LINE>Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb,</LINE>
<LINE>And by and by my master drew on him,</LINE>
<LINE>And then I ran away to call the watch.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRIN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This letter doth make good the friar&#8217;s words,</LINE>
<LINE>Their course of love, the tidings of her death;</LINE>
<LINE>And here he writes that he did buy a poison</LINE>
<LINE>Of a poor pothecary, and therewithal</LINE>
<LINE>Came to this vault, to die and lie with Juliet.</LINE>
<LINE>Where be these enemies? Capulet! Montague!</LINE>
<LINE>See what a scourge is laid upon your hate,</LINE>
<LINE>That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love.</LINE>
<LINE>And I for winking at your discords too</LINE>
<LINE>Have lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punish&#8217;d.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O brother Montague, give me thy hand.</LINE>
<LINE>This is my daughter&#8217;s jointure, for no more</LINE>
<LINE>Can I demand.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MON.</SPEAKER>
<LINE offset="3">But I can give thee more,</LINE>
<LINE>For I will raise her statue in pure gold,</LINE>
<LINE>That whiles Verona by that name is known,</LINE>
<LINE>There shall no figure at such rate be set</LINE>
<LINE>As that of true and faithful Juliet.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAP.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As rich shall Romeo&#8217;s by his lady&#8217;s lie,</LINE>
<LINE>Poor sacrifices of our enmity!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PRIN.</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A glooming peace this morning with it brings,</LINE>
<LINE>The sun, for sorrow, will not show his head.</LINE>
<LINE>Go hence to have more talk of these sad things;</LINE>
<LINE>Some shall be pardon&#8217;d, and some punished:</LINE>
<LINE>For never was a story of more woe</LINE>
<LINE>Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.</LINE>
</SPEECH>
<STAGEDIR>Exeunt omnes.</STAGEDIR>
