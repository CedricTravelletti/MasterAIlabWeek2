<persona gender="male">
<persname short="CHORUS.">Chorus</persname>
<persdescription>Chorus introduces each of the first two acts, setting both the theme of the play and its style. Speaking in sonnet form, he accustoms the ear to listen for echoes of that style.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="PRIN.">Prince Escalus</persname>
<persdescription>Prince Escalus of Verona has the misfortune of ruling over a state where two major families are locked in an unending war. The mere authority of his presence is no longer enough to make people pay attention to him: he must back it up with threats of torture and death. He does not even summon Capulet and Montague to appear together before him, but gives them separate appointments. When a further brawl not only kills one of the chief troublemakers but also the Prince&#8217;s own kinsman, Mercutio, he exiles the killer Romeo and attempts to bring peace by hitting the two families in their pocketbook. He soon loses another kinsman, County Paris, and concludes to his own guilt in the affair for not having been severe enough with the warring families. Despite the power of his speeches, his authority seems rather disregarded.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="PAR.">Paris</persname>
<persdescription>County Paris is a nobleman of Verona, close kin to the Prince and to Mercutio. He is a suitor to the hand of Capulet&#8217;s daughter Juliet, and though he accepts that she is still young, he hopes to marry her soon all the same. He comes to visit Capulet after Tybalt&#8217;s death to see how his suit proceeds, and is soon scheduled to marry Juliet in three days. He rushes to ask Friar Laurence to officiate at the ceremony. Meeting Juliet on his way out, he is kind but possessive towards her. His wedding day is marred when the bride turns out to have died overnight. That night, he goes to pay homage at her grave, and spots Romeo breaking in. Supposing him trying to perpetrate some outrage on the dead bodies of Tybalt and Juliet, he steps forward to stop him, and is killed. Despite having kept himself aloof from the feud between the two families, he hence ends up one of its victims. He is a pleasant man of whom there seems to be no ill to tell.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="MON.">Montague</persname>
<persdescription>Montague is the head of an old family of Verona. Caught up in his family&#8217;s old quarrel with the Capulets, he is willing to throw himself bodily into the fray despite his age. He is concerned about his son Romeo&#8217;s melancholy. When Romeo kills Tybalt, his father defends him to the Prince, arguing that Tybalt&#8217;s life was already forfeit and that Romeo hence committed no crime. By the end of the play he will lose both his son and his wife. He offers a gold statue of Juliet to Capulet as a sign of their new friendship at the end of the play, one-upping Capulet&#8217;s proffered handshake.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="CAP.">Capulet</persname>
<persdescription>Capulet is the head of an old family of Verona. He has only one child left, Juliet, and he does everything in his power to do his best for her and obtain an honorable and noble marriage for her. He wishes to wait until she is sixteen for her to be married, though, and insists that she too must consent to the match before it is made. He therefore requires his chosen wooer, Paris, to get to know her and hopefully have her come to like him. Capulet is both irascible and honorable: while he calls for his sword despite his wife&#8217;s mockery in the opening brawl and fully intends to fight in it himself, he also refuses to eject Romeo from his feast, given that the lad has a good reputation and is a guest &#8212; though he may mainly be afraid of the Prince&#8217;s reaction if a fight ensues. He feels his age, missing the days when he could be as wild as the young men in masks who come to his feast. He has little patience for his hot-tempered nephew-by-marriage Tybalt, and intends to have mastery over him. When the young man is killed, he is silent before the Prince, allowing his wife to plead for vengeance. He attempts to cheer things up by advancing Juliet&#8217;s marriage to Paris, and loses his temper completely when she demurs, threatening to disown her and coming close to beating her. When she relents, he becomes rather giddy, advancing the wedding to the next day and spending the whole night in making the preparations for the ceremony. Juliet&#8217;s death hits him hard; and when the whole story is revealed at the graveyard, he is remorseful and is the first to hold out his hand to Montague. When the latter one-ups his gesture by offering a rich golden statue of Juliet, he quickly matches the offer.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="OLD. CAP.">Old Capulet</persname>
<persdescription>Old Capulet, Capulet&#8217;s cousin, is an old man, possibly even his uncle. He sits with Capulet at the feast and gossips of old times and people they know.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="ROM.">Romeo</persname>
<persdescription>Romeo is the only son of the Montague family of Verona. He is well-versed in Petrarchan-style poetry, which forms the essence of his speaking style. He seems to take little part in the feud with the Capulets, being far too busy mooning over Rosaline. Even when he comes across evidence of yet another brawl, though he laments that it should have occurred, he quickly turns it into a commentary for his love for Rosaline. Said love is washed quite clean from his mind the moment he meets Juliet, Capulet&#8217;s daughter. Sneaking into her garden and speaking with her, he is forced by her common sense and the reality of her existence to cease using the fake, stylized language he used about the unobtainable Rosaline. Convinced by his confessor Friar Laurence that his marriage to Juliet may help to reconcile the two warring families, he refuses to respond to Tybalt&#8217;s taunts and challenges, leading his best friend Mercutio to consider him a coward. Attempting to stop the fight between Tybalt and Mercutio, he merely causes the latter&#8217;s death, which is enough to make his pacific disposition crack and for him to kill Tybalt in return. The fact of exile brings him to the brink of suicide at the thought of never seeing Juliet again, refusing to see all the ways in which he is lucky. Waiting for news in Mantua, he hears of Juliet&#8217;s death and rushes to her grave to kill himself to be with her. He is a good companion and gets along well with most people. He is especially close to Mercutio and to Friar Laurence, as well as to his cousin Benvolio. Even old Capulet, the head of his family enemies, admits him to be a virtuous young man. He is also highly emotional and given to acting on his impulses. He is in his mid-teens.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="MER.">Mercutio</persname>
<persdescription>Mercutio is a kinsman of the Prince&#8217;s, and a close friend of Romeo&#8217;s. He is extremely quick-witted, has a fantastical min, and is an excellent fencer who does not care for overly mathematical fencing. He has a taste for puncturing things that are taken too seriously, especially love, and is extremely good at this. He reduces love to mere lust, and dislikes that love makes a good ol&#8217; boy become a melancholic personage to whom nothing can be said. Invited to Capulet&#8217;s feast, he allows Romeo and Benvolio to crash the party with him. He is very good friends with Benvolio, though the latter&#8217;s attempts to keep him under control rarely succeed. Quite able to provoke a quarrel with Tybalt, he steps back to allow Romeo to have his duel, but is sickened when the latter refuses. Stepping in to fight instead, he is mortally wounded, but manages to curse the feud and all its participants before dying.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="BEN.">Benvolio</persname>
<persdescription>Benvolio is Montague&#8217;s nephew. By nature law-abiding and peaceful, he attempts to break up the opening quarrel only to end up embroiled in it. Fond of his cousin Romeo, he does not seem to take his melancholy overly seriously. He attempts to cure Romeo of his passion for Rosaline by suggesting that they crash the Capulet party that evening and look at all the various beauties of Verona. Neither Romeo&#8217;s love poetry nor Mercutio&#8217;s fantastical imaginings have much effect on him: he is more concerned about missing a meal. He is very much the straight man of their trio, attempting to calm both down, with occasional but rare success. He coaxes Romeo to flee after killing Tybalt, and does his best to excuse his cousin&#8217;s act to the Prince.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="TYB.">Tybalt</persname>
<persdescription>Tybalt is the nephew of Capulet&#8217;s wife, and that family&#8217;s chief troublemaker. An excellent fenceman, he seeks out opportunities to fight, any excuse being good. He is willing to start a fight at his uncle&#8217;s feast, being only restrained by the latter&#8217;s fury. Instead, he sends Romeo a formal challenge. He despises anyone who speaks of keeping the peace, and when Romeo simply states that he is not a villain, he does not take this for an answer. He does not much care for Mercutio, and is quite willing to fight with him when challenged. He kills Mercutio by stabbing him under Romeo&#8217;s arm, and having fled is foolish enough to return to the square, where he ends up in the fight with Romeo where he loses his life. Though we do not see this side of him, the Nurse considers him to be courteous and honest, and the best friend she had.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="PETR.">Petruchio</persname>
<persdescription>Petruchio is one of Tybalt&#8217;s friends. He is present at the Capulets&#8217; feast and accompanies Tybalt when the latter goes seeking Romeo the next day. He hurries Tybalt away after Mercutio&#8217;s death.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="FRI. L.">Friar Lawrence</persname>
<persdescription>Friar Laurence is a Franciscan friar who is confessor to both Juliet and Romeo, and whom Paris immediately thinks of when he requires a priest for his wedding. A gardener with a vast knowledge of plants and their properties, Friar Laurence is something of a mentor to Romeo, often telling him off for the ridiculousness of his calf-love for Rosaline. The speed at which Romeo switches his affections from Rosaline to Juliet appalls him, but he chooses to assist the young man in the hopes of bringing an end to the war between Capulets and Montagues. He tries to snap Romeo out of his suicidal angst after being banished, and plans for him to stay in Mantua for a time before making all well. Paris and Capulet&#8217;s insistence on Juliet&#8217;s early marriage to the County throws a kink into his plans, and he is faced with another suicidal teenager. This time, the idea of suicide makes him think of counterfeit deaths, and he thinks up an elaborate plot to fake Juliet&#8217;s death and sneak her out of Verona. When his letters explaining this to Romeo do not make it to their intended recipient, he is not overly concerned, but hurries to Juliet&#8217;s grave to wake up her up. The closer he gets the more worried he gets, and when on meeting Balthasar he learns that Romeo has arrived at the grave he is taken with fear. He attempts to get Juliet to leave the tomb, but when she demurs he is too frightened of the approaching Watch to stay with her. Captured, he admits all the story to the Prince, taking full responsibility and offering his life to the Prince.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="FRI. J.">Friar John</persname>
<persdescription>Friar John is sent by Friar Laurence to Mantua, with letters informing Romeo that Juliet is not in fact dead. Unaware of the importance of the letter, he does not use extreme measures to pass it on when he is stopped from entering Mantua for fear of the plague.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="BAL.">Balthasar</persname>
<persdescription>Balthasar is Romeo&#8217;s manservant. He brings the rope ladder to the Nurse for her to leave in Juliet&#8217;s room. Hearing the news of Juliet&#8217;s death, he hurries to Mantua to inform his master of it. He accompanies Romeo to the Capulet tomb. When ordered to leave, however, he instead decides to hide nearby and watch what happens, being afraid of Romeo&#8217;s intent. When Friar Laurence arrives, he tells all he knows, but still does not dare to follow the friar into the tomb.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="ABR.">Abram</persname>
<persdescription>Abram is one of Montague&#8217;s servingmen. He and a companion are silently insulted by two of Capulet&#8217;s men in the public square, which he queries. He insists he has no intention of quarreling until such time as he refuses to admit that Capulet is a better man than Montague. This sets off the opening brawl.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="SAM.">Sampson</persname>
<persdescription>Sampson is one of Capulet&#8217;s servants. He has a taste for bawdy puns and a great liking for women. He sets Gregory on to start a quarrel with the Montague servants, while making sure that they stay on the right side of the law by not being seen to start the brawl. He bites his thumb at the Montagues to put them in an impossible situation, and leads them to where they must draw and fight.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="GRE.">Gregory</persname>
<persdescription>Gregory is one of Capulet&#8217;s servants. He has a tendency towards wordplay, and plays this well with Sampson. He helps the latter in starting a quarrel with the Montague servants while appearing to be the offended party. He is insistent that the quarrel between the masters must be shared by their servants.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="PET.">Peter</persname>
<persdescription>Peter is a servingman of the Capulets&#8217; who accompanies the Nurse when she goes out of the house, partly as her protection and partly to carry her fan. At Juliet&#8217;s death, he begs the musicians to play some merry music for him, and taunts them when they refuse.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="PAGE.">Page to Paris</persname>
<persdescription>Paris&#8217;s Page accompanies his master to Juliet&#8217;s grave. Frightened of graveyards at night, he stays all the same, until he sees his master in a fight with some unknown man, and runs to fetch the Watch.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="AP.">Apothecary</persname>
<persdescription>Apothecary is a poor, starving, skeletal man with massive eyebrows whose shop does little business. Despite the threat of death if he is caught having sold poison, he accepts to give Romeo a deadly dose in return for a great deal of money.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="female">
<persname short="LA. MON.">Lady Montague</persname>
<persdescription>Lady Montague, tries to hold back her husband from doing any actual fighting, and is worried that her son Romeo might have joined in. She dies of grief when he is exiled.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="female">
<persname short="LA. CAP.">Lady Capulet</persname>
<persdescription>Lady Capulet is approximately 28, and makes mock of her aged husband&#8217;s pretensions to fighting. She is not entirely certain of how to broach the subject of marriage to her daughter, and is rather over-elaborate in her instructions of how to look at Paris during the night&#8217;s feast. She is Tybalt&#8217;s aunt, and much devoted to him; when the Prince merely exiles his killer Romeo, she plans to have him poisoned. She reveals this to Juliet while trying to comfort the girl in her distress over Tybalt&#8217;s death. When Juliet refuses to marry Paris, Lady Capulet thinks her husband&#8217;s anger is too great, but she still has no sympathy for her daughter. The discovery of the truth of her daughter&#8217;s death makes her suddenly feel old.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="female">
<persname short="JUL.">Juliet</persname>
<persdescription>Juliet is the only child of the Capulet family. A fortnight shy of fourteen, she is an obedient child, but reveals herself to be passionate and willing to betray all that she has been brought up to when she falls in love with Romeo. Though she can play Petrarchan word-games as well as Romeo, she has little patience for them once she has completely fallen for him. She is a practical girl, arranging for such things as meeting-times, secret messages, and marriage plans, things that Romeo simply doesn&#8217;t think of. She is also impatient (a quality her nurse plays on) and physical: her love for Romeo is not merely spiritual, and she impatiently looks forward to her wedding night. When only a few hours after her marriage she discovers that Romeo has killed her cousin Tybalt, she is at first torn, but quickly dismisses Tybalt from her thoughts to concentrate on Romeo&#8217;s banishment. He sneaks in for the night, and she does not want him to leave in the morning, but soon has to force him to go, at which time she is taken by a terrifying premonition of their deaths. Believing that her grief is over her cousin&#8217;s death, her parents attempt to mend it by bringing her wedding to County Paris forward. Standing up to them, Juliet finds herself cut off from her parents&#8217; love; her last comfort, the Nurse, betrays her by suggesting that she go ahead with marrying Paris. Ready to kill herself if all else fails, she accepts Friar Lawrence&#8217;s plan to fake her death, and takes his sleeping potion despite her fears. Waking to find Romeo dead beside her, she refuses to leave with the Friar, she stabs herself before anyone can reach her.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="female">
<persname short="NURSE.">Nurse</persname>
<persdescription>Nurse is Juliet&#8217;s closest companion, the woman who in essence brought her up. Gossipy, chattering, teasing, and with a taste for bawdy stories, she greatly loves the Capulets, considering Tybalt to be her best friend. She acts as an intermediary between Juliet and Romeo despite her misgivings and her belief that County Paris is the better man, and sneaks in the rope ladder that allows Romeo to visit Juliet for their wedding night. She at times has scant regard for men in general compared to her deceased husband, and thinks that Romeo&#8217;s blubbering after killing Tybalt is unmanly and useless. She attempts at all times to protect her charge, standing up to Capulet when he threatens to disinherit Juliet, but also counseling the girl to marry County Paris after all when she sees no way for it to be avoided. Distraught at Juliet&#8217;s death, she tells the musicians to put away their instruments. Other than caring for Juliet, she works in the Capulet pantry. When going out, she has herself accompanied by Peter.</persdescription>

<persname short="1. MUS.">First Musician</persname>

<persona gender="male">
<persname short="2. SERV.">Second Servingman</persname>
<persdescription>Second Servingman (Clown) is unable to read, which does not prevent Capulet from sending him out to deliver the invitations to his feast. He asks the first learned person he meets for help, and thus informs Romeo and Benvolio of the feast and Rosaline&#8217;s presence at it. He helps with the table service at the feast. He is sent to hire cooks for Juliet&#8217;s wedding and is not afraid of joking with Capulet, who appreciates his wit.</persdescription>
</persona>

<persona gender="male">

<scenepersonae>(Sampson, Gregory, Abram, Balthasar, Benvolio, Tybalt, Citizens, Montague, Lady Montague, Prince Escalus, Romeo)</scenepersonae>
<scenedescription>Capulet&#8217;s servants pick a quarrel with Montague&#8217;s, which degenerates into a general brawl. Obedient to the Prince&#8217;s ruling against brawling, Benvolio tries to part them, but he is attacked by Tybalt, who calls him a coward for speaking of peace. Infuriated citizens begin hitting at the brawlers on both sides, as Capulet and Montague themselves enter the fray. The anarchy only ceases when the Prince himself arrives and orders an end to the fighting, threatening both Capulet and Montague with death if another battle erupts. Montague, his wife and Benvolio are left alone as the others depart. Benvolio explains how the fight began, and is able to reassure his aunt that Romeo was not present. Romeo&#8217;s parents are concerned about his melancholy, and Benvolio promises to find to what&#8217;s going on. Seeing Romeo arrive, his parents leave to give Benvolio a clear field. It quickly becomes apparent from Romeo&#8217;s hackneyed phrases that he believes himself to be deeply in love with a lady who has sworn to be chaste. Benvolio advises him to find some better-looking women to run after, but Romeo insists there are none.</scenedescription>

<scenedescription>The Prince&#8217;s kinsman Paris receives Capulet&#8217;s permission to woo his daughter Juliet, though Capulet considers her still too young for marriage. He insists that he will not make her marry a man she does not love. He invites Paris to a feast that evening, and sends a servant out with a list of other people to invite. Unfortunately, the servant is illiterate. Coming upon the educated Benvolio and Romeo, he asks them to read the list to him, which they do. They thus learn that not only is Capulet giving a party, but that Romeo&#8217;s love Rosaline will be there. Benvolio tells Romeo that seeing her in the company of other ladies will make it clear that she&#8217;s nothing special, but Romeo insists that she will outshine them all.</scenedescription>

Lady Capulet finally brings herself to ask Juliet whether she thinks herself ready for marriage. She praises Paris, as does the Nurse, and instructs the girl to have a good look at him at the party that night. The obedient girl dutifully replies that she will do as her parents say.

<scenelocation>Verona. A hall in Capulet&#8217;s house.</scenelocation>
<scenepersonae>(Anthony, Potpan, Capulet, Lady Capulet, Old Capulet, Juliet, Tybalt, Nurse, Servingmen, Guests, Gentlewomen, Maskers)</scenepersonae>
<scenedescription>Capulet&#8217;s servants bustle about. Capulet and his guests come in to greet the masked gentlemen who have just entered, and dancing begins. Capulet and a kinsman reflect on how long it&#8217;s been since they last danced themselves. Romeo spots Juliet and is overcome by her beauty, but makes the mistake of commenting aloud: Tybalt overhears him and recognizes his voice. He sends for his sword, but he is interrupted by old Capulet, who refuses to see his house turned into a brawling place, especially since Romeo is an admired young man. When Tybalt persists, Capulet puts him in his place. Tybalt vows to make Romeo pay. Romeo speaks to Juliet, and their immediate understanding of one another is clear in how well she picks up and plays with the language he uses. He manages to steal two kisses from her before she is called away. When he asks, the Nurse tells Romeo that Juliet is the Capulets&#8217; daughter, and just how rich she is. Romeo is shocked that he has fallen for his great enemy. As the maskers leave, Juliet makes the Nurse find out who Romeo is, and she is equally appalled.</scenedescription>

<scenepersonae>(Romeo, Juliet, Nurse)</scenepersonae>
<scenedescription>Romeo comments scathingly on Mercutio&#8217;s comments as he hears the latter leave. He is immediately distracted, though, when he sees a light at a balcony window, and sees Juliet come out into the night. Admiringly, he looks at her, finding her even more beautiful than the first time he saw her. She begins to speak to herself, and he is amazed as he hears her wish that he were not a Montague, since that is the only bar between them. Soon he can take no more and he replies to her. She is shocked, and immediately afraid for his life, but lets him stay, and they admit their mutual love. Much more practical than he is, Juliet undercuts all his flowery phrases, and moves on to the subject of marriage. The Nurse calls for Juliet to come in, but she delays again and again, unwilling to let Romeo go and always finding new details to ask of him. Finally, as the sun is soon going to come up, they manage to part.</scenedescription>

<scenedescription>Friar Laurence picks herbs, commenting on their similarities with humans as he does so. Romeo arrives, and Laurence quickly works out that for him to be up so early, he must simply not have gone to bed. Romeo admits it, and Laurence fears that he spent the night with Rosaline, at which point Romeo is forced to admit he&#8217;d completely forgotten about her. The young man explains his love for Juliet and asks for Laurence&#8217;s help in marrying her; the friar upbraids him for his inconstancy and the shallowness of his doting on Rosaline, but agrees to help him in this instance in the hope of ending the enmity between the two houses.</scenedescription>

<scenepersonae>(Benvolio, Mercutio, Romeo, Nurse, Peter)</scenepersonae>
<scenedescription>Benvolio and Mercutio still have no idea where Romeo is, but have heard that Tybalt sent him a formal challenge. Mercutio, bantering as always, points out that Tybalt is deadly in a duel. When Romeo arrives, Mercutio is unsparing in his mockery, but Romeo manages to keep up with him, proving to Mercutio that his melancholy is gone. The Nurse enters with her servant Peter, searching for Romeo, much to the amusement of his fellows. Mercutio and Benvolio leave, and the Nurse berates Peter for not standing up to them. Romeo tells her to let Juliet know that if she goes to Friar Laurence&#8217;s, they shall be married. He also arranges to have the Nurse pick up a rope ladder so that he can visit Juliet more easily at night. The Nurse is delighted, and goes off to tell Juliet.</scenedescription>

<scenepersonae>(Mercutio, Benvolio, Page, Men, Tybalt, Petruchio, Romeo, Citizens, Prince Escalus, Montague, Capulet, Lady Capulet, Lady Montague)</scenepersonae>
<scenedescription>Benvolio tries to get Mercutio to go indoors, as the day is very hot and this causes short tempers that might lead to a brawl. Tybalt and his companions appear, searching for Romeo. He speaks insultingly to Mercutio, who replies in kind, and they are on the verge of fighting, with Benvolio urging them to go somewhere private, when Romeo arrives. Tybalt calls Romeo a villain, an unforgivable insult, but Romeo, who is after all now Tybalt&#8217;s kinsman though no-one knows it, peacefully refuses to answer back in kind. Disgusted at seeing Romeo be such a wimp, Mercutio takes up the fight instead. Romeo tries to separate the two, referring to the Prince&#8217;s decree against fighting, but as he gets between them Tybalt stabs Mercutio under Romeo&#8217;s arm. Tybalt flees. Even though mortally wounded, Mercutio still manages to make bad puns about death, before cursing both Capulets and Montagues, laying his death at their doors. Romeo is horrified that his love for Juliet has caused this, and when Benvolio reports that Mercutio is dead, he bursts into a rage, seeing Tybalt return. He throws himself at Tybalt, and after a fight Romeo kills Mercutio&#8217;s murderer. Benvolio forces Romeo to flee, as the citizens are roused and the law prescribes death for brawlers. The Prince, the Montagues and the Capulets all arrive. Benvolio explains how things occurred. Lady Capulet demands Romeo&#8217;s death, but Montague points out that Tybalt was already doomed to die for killing Mercutio. Bearing that in mind, the Prince exiles Romeo, on pain of death; with Mercutio, his kinsman, dead, the Prince has now been touched directly by the feud, and he swears to levy a massive fine on both families to keep them quiet.</scenedescription>

<scenepersonae>(Juliet, Nurse)</scenepersonae>
<scenedescription>Juliet in her garden impatiently waits for the day to end and her wedding night to begin. The Nurse returns in tears, and her speech is so jumbled that Juliet believes Romeo is dead. When the Nurse finally spills out the true tale, Juliet is torn between her love for Romeo and hatred of him for killing her cousin, but finally love for her husband is too strong. She laments Romeo&#8217;s banishment, and to calm her overwrought grief, the Nurse promises to go find Romeo and work things out.</scenedescription>

<scenedescription>Romeo is distraught at being banished from Juliet, but Laurence has little patience with his refusal to see how lucky he is not to be condemned to death. The Nurse arrives and reassures Romeo that Juliet still loves him, though she notes that both of them are just lying around crying. Romeo is still so grief-struck that he attempts to stab himself, but at this Laurence has finally had enough. He points out all the ways in which Romeo is lucky and tells him to stop moaning. He tells the lad to go to Juliet for their wedding night, then leave for Mantua until the storm blows over and things can be explained. Seeing Romeo revived, the Nurse goes to tell Juliet that Romeo will be there that night. The Friar makes arrangements for Romeo&#8217;s departure to Mantua, and for how they will communicate.</scenedescription>

<scenepersonae>(Romeo, Juliet, Nurse, Lady Capulet, Capulet)</scenepersonae>
<scenedescription>Romeo and Juliet part at the break of dawn, though Juliet wants to deny that it is that late. She almost convinces Romeo to stay, but then reality breaks in and she insists that he flee before he is caught. The Nurse announces that Lady Capulet is coming, and Romeo descends from the balcony to the garden. From her high vantage point, Juliet has a premonition that they will never meet again. He leaves. Lady Capulet comes in, and thinks that her daughter&#8217;s distraction is grief over Tybalt&#8217;s death. She tries to comfort her daughter by promising to have Romeo poisoned. She then tells her that she is to be married in two days, but the horrified Juliet refuses. When Capulet hears of this, he is infuriated, and swears to disown her unless she gives in, feeling she is rejecting all the efforts he has made to find her a good match. Lady Capulet refuses her daughter any sympathy. The Nurse, for her part, can see no solution other than agreeing to marry Paris, and recommends that she forget Romeo. Juliet is outraged at her suggestion, but sends her to tell her parents that she is going to Friar Laurence&#8217;s to confess. Once the Nurse has gone, Juliet curses her and decides never to trust her again. She is resolved to kill herself if Laurence can&#8217;t come up with a solution.</scenedescription>

<scenepersonae>(Friar Lawrence, County Paris, Juliet)</scenepersonae>
<scenedescription>Paris has come to ask Friar Laurence to officiate at his wedding. He admits that things are moving quickly, but explains that Capulet doesn&#8217;t think Juliet should mourn as much as she is doing. Juliet arrives, and Paris speaks kindly if possessively to her. Juliet replies with double meanings. Paris leaves her to confess, and she begs Laurence for a solution, threatening to kill herself if he can&#8217;t find one. He suddenly finds one: if she has the courage, he can give her a sleeping potion that will make her seem dead to everyone. She will then be buried in the Capulet tomb, and he and Romeo could rescue her later. She agrees.</scenedescription>

<scenedescription>Lady Capulet and the Nurse bid Juliet good night. She prepares to take the potion, but is frightened. Uncertain that it will work, she lays down a dagger by her side so that she can kill herself in the morning if need be. The potion worries her: she is fearful of waking up in the grave, even doubts Laurence&#8217;s intentions, is afraid the potion might be poison, and terrified of Tybalt&#8217;s ghost. Nevertheless, she drinks it.</scenedescription>

<scenelocation>A churchyard; before a tomb belonging to the Capulets.</scenelocation>
<scenepersonae>(Paris, Page, Romeo, Balthasar, Friar Lawrence, Juliet, Boy, Watchmen, Prince Escalus, Attendants, Montague)</scenepersonae>
<scenedescription>Paris arrives at the Capulet tomb bearing flowers. Wishing to be alone, he tells his page to watch and whistle if anyone else approaches. Paris strews his flowers over the grave, and as he promises Juliet to do this every night, he hears the page whistle. He hides. Romeo and Balthasar appear. Romeo orders his servant to leave him alone, but Balthasar, worried, only goes a little way off. Recognizing Romeo as he breaks into the tomb, Paris steps forward to apprehend him, persuaded that Romeo is trying to wreak some outrage on the tomb. Romeo warns Paris off, but Paris is insistent, and the two fight. The page runs off to find the Watch, while Romeo kills Paris. Only once he is dead does Romeo find out who he is. As he was requested, he lays Paris by Juliet&#8217;s side. He then bids farewell to Paris, Juliet and Tybalt, drinks the poison, and dies. Friar Laurence arrives and runs into Balthasar. Growing deeply worried, Laurence rushes into the tomb, where he finds Paris and Romeo&#8217;s bodies. Juliet awakes, and Laurence tries to get her out without her seeing Romeo, but fails. Hearing the noise of the approaching watch, he loses his nerve and flees. Juliet realizes what has happened, but Romeo has drunk all the poison, and there is none left. So she takes his dagger and stabs herself. The Watch arrive and begin gathering up everyone they find in the graveyard. The Prince appears, accompanied by the Capulets and Montagues. Laurence is brought in and explains all that has happened, shouldering the blame. The Prince refuses to accept this, and lays the blame squarely on the quarrelling families, seeing that the deaths have punished everybody. Capulet and Montague unite in grief and swear friendship, promising to pay for golden statues of the lovers. The Prince leads them away to discuss the matter further and decide on punishments for those deserving of them.</scenedescription>

<speaker>FRI. L.</speaker>
<line form="verse">I am the greatest, able to do least,</line>
<line form="verse">Yet most suspected, as the time and place</line>
<line form="verse">Doth make against me, of this direful murder;</line>
<line form="verse">And here I stand both to impeach and purge</line>
<line form="verse">Myself condemned and myself excus&#8217;d.</line>

<speaker>PRIN.</speaker>
<line form="verse">Then say at once what thou dost know in this.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>FRI. L.</speaker>
<line form="verse">I will be brief, for my short date of breath</line>
<line form="verse">Is not so long as is a tedious tale.</line>
<line form="verse">Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet,</line>
<line form="verse">And she, there dead, that Romeo&#8217;s faithful wife.</line>
<line form="verse">I married them, and their stol&#8217;n marriage-day</line>
<line form="verse">Was Tybalt&#8217;s dooms-day, whose untimely death</line>
<line form="verse">Banish&#8217;d the new-made bridegroom from this city,</line>
<line form="verse">For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin&#8217;d.</line>
<line form="verse">You, to remove that siege of grief from her,</line>
<line form="verse">Betroth&#8217;d and would have married her perforce</line>
<line form="verse">To County Paris. Then comes she to me,</line>
<line form="verse">And with wild looks bid me devise some mean</line>
<line form="verse">To rid her from this second marriage,</line>
<line form="verse">Or in my cell there would she kill herself.</line>
<line form="verse">Then gave I her (so tutor&#8217;d by my art)</line>
<line form="verse">A sleeping potion, which so took effect</line>
<line form="verse">As I intended, for it wrought on her</line>
<line form="verse">The form of death. Mean time I writ to Romeo,</line>
<line form="verse">That he should hither come as this dire night</line>
<line form="verse">To help to take her from her borrowed grave,</line>
<line form="verse">Being the time the potion&#8217;s force should cease.</line>
<line form="verse">But he which bore my letter, Friar John,</line>
<line form="verse">Was stayed by accident, and yesternight</line>
<line form="verse">Return&#8217;d my letter back. Then all alone,</line>
<line form="verse">At the prefixed hour of her waking,</line>
<line form="verse">Came I to take her from her kindred&#8217;s vault,</line>
<line form="verse">Meaning to keep her closely at my cell,</line>
<line form="verse">Till I conveniently could send to Romeo.</line>
<line form="verse">But when I came, some minute ere the time</line>
<line form="verse">Of her awakening, here untimely lay</line>
<line form="verse">The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.</line>
<line form="verse">She wakes, and I entreated her come forth</line>
<line form="verse">And bear this work of heaven with patience.</line>
<line form="verse">But then a noise did scare me from the tomb,</line>
<line form="verse">And she, too desperate, would not go with me,</line>
<line form="verse">But as it seems, did violence on herself.</line>
<line form="verse">All this I know, and to the marriage</line>
<line form="verse">Her nurse is privy; and if aught in this</line>
<line form="verse">Miscarried by my fault, let my old life</line>
<line form="verse">Be sacrific&#8217;d some hour before his time,</line>
<line form="verse">Unto the rigor of severest law.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRIN.</speaker>
<line form="verse">We still have known thee for a holy man.</line>
<line form="verse">Where&#8217;s Romeo&#8217;s man? What can he say to this?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>BAL.</speaker>
<line form="verse">I brought my master news of Juliet&#8217;s death,</line>
<line form="verse">And then in post he came from Mantua</line>
<line form="verse">To this same place, to this same monument.</line>
<line form="verse">This letter he early bid me give his father,</line>
<line form="verse">And threat&#8217;ned me with death, going in the vault,</line>
<line form="verse">If I departed not and left him there.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRIN.</speaker>
<line form="verse">Give me the letter, I will look on it.</line>
<line form="verse">Where is the County&#8217;s page that rais&#8217;d the watch?</line>
<line form="verse">Sirrah, what made your master in this place?</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PAGE.</speaker>
<line form="verse">He came with flowers to strew his lady&#8217;s grave,</line>
<line form="verse">And bid me stand aloof, and so I did.</line>
<line form="verse">Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb,</line>
<line form="verse">And by and by my master drew on him,</line>
<line form="verse">And then I ran away to call the watch.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRIN.</speaker>
<line form="verse">This letter doth make good the friar&#8217;s words,</line>
<line form="verse">Their course of love, the tidings of her death;</line>
<line form="verse">And here he writes that he did buy a poison</line>
<line form="verse">Of a poor pothecary, and therewithal</line>
<line form="verse">Came to this vault, to die and lie with Juliet.</line>
<line form="verse">Where be these enemies? Capulet! Montague!</line>
<line form="verse">See what a scourge is laid upon your hate,</line>
<line form="verse">That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love.</line>
<line form="verse">And I for winking at your discords too</line>
<line form="verse">Have lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punish&#8217;d.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CAP.</speaker>
<line form="verse">O brother Montague, give me thy hand.</line>
<line form="verse">This is my daughter&#8217;s jointure, for no more</line>
<line form="verse">Can I demand.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>MON.</speaker>
<line form="verse" offset="3">But I can give thee more,</line>
<line form="verse">For I will raise her statue in pure gold,</line>
<line form="verse">That whiles Verona by that name is known,</line>
<line form="verse">There shall no figure at such rate be set</line>
<line form="verse">As that of true and faithful Juliet.</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>CAP.</speaker>
<line form="verse">As rich shall Romeo&#8217;s by his lady&#8217;s lie,</line>
<line form="verse">Poor sacrifices of our enmity!</line>
</speech>

<speech>
<speaker>PRIN.</speaker>
<line form="verse">A glooming peace this morning with it brings,</line>
<line form="verse">The sun, for sorrow, will not show his head.</line>
<line form="verse">Go hence to have more talk of these sad things;</line>
<line form="verse">Some shall be pardon&#8217;d, and some punished:</line>
<line form="verse">For never was a story of more woe</line>
<line form="verse">Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.</line>
